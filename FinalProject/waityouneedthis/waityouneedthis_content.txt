Last week I had the opportunity to attend Atlanta Apparel, an apparel trade show held in Atlanta. You may have caught the fun over on my IG stories! If you’ve never been to a trade show, it’s basically a space for brands whether established or new to meet and share next season’s trends with retail buyers. I used to attend shows seasonally back when I was an assistant buyer for Bloomingdale’s. It was so much fun to get away from my desk and check out what’s coming down the pike for next season, discover new designers, and connect with the brands. Atlanta Apparel hosts contemporary, young contemporary, ready-to-wear, accessories and more. There’s even a runway show. In case you missed it, here’s a recap of some of the brands and trends I discovered while exploring the market’s 14 floors of fashion!


I saw loads of sequins and metallic pieces throughout the day. Definitely add this trend to your shopping list!


If you know me, you know I’m all about a flowy midi or maxi moment. So glad to see this trend around the market. I love this more polished take.

There was a Miami based showroom that focused on Spanish designers. I was dying over the dress below by Lulu. Can’t wait for it to come out this spring!
 
Florals for spring are always in style.

New dress brand One Pretty Time (O.P.T.) is launching this spring. Think feminine frocks in mini, midi, and maxi lengths and from prints to pleats to sequins. Below is a sneak peek!

 If you are a shop owner or looking to grow your clothing or accessories brand, you must look into attending the next market!

We’re married!
On August 4th in Palmetto Bluff, South Carolina, Shola and I tied the knot and teamed up with BRIDES to do it! You may have been following along when I announced that we would be this years couple for BRIDES Live Wedding and when I updated you on how planning was going. I’d like to extend a sincere thank you to all who voted for our wedding day details, from my dress to the decor to what we would do on our honeymoon—more on that coming soon. Now I’m sharing our big day and how everything turned out! Keep reading to see how our wedding came to life!


The winning dress was a romantic ballgown. The gown felt glamorous and very bridal, but was also quite clean and simple with a cascading ruffle detail.

You know I had to have a second dress! I went for a more form fitting, strapless gown with a modern take on lace.
Dress // Ellington by Maggie Sottero

I had a very small wedding party, just my sister as my maid of honor. She and my mom helped me get dressed in the cute bridal cottage.

We chose to have a first look so there would be plenty of time for photos! We met in a secluded path framed with rows of Spanish moss-filled trees. The oh-so-romantic Spanish moss was what made me fall in love with this venue.




After our first look, we explored the resort’s 20,000 acres with the BRIDES team and took portraits all over the grounds. The BRIDES team asked me if I was comfortable hopping on this swing in heels. Umm, yeah I was!



And of course we had to have a little bohemian bridal moment. Enter area rugs and pillow a plenty!


Just out here being a blushing bride.


Our wedding venue was the stunning Montage Palmetto Bluff resort. The ceremony took place in the most intimate chapel where the benches were made from reclaimed wood from 9/11.  We were honored to have this piece of New York City play a part in our wedding day.


“Greenery” was our winning BRIDES Live Wedding decor concept. The BRIDES team was inspired by the southern tropical vibes of  South Carolina and brought that inspiration into all of the florals with an eclectic mix of crawling palms and white blooms. I walked down the aisle to “At Last” by Etta James and our family members read an excerpt from The Alchemist (one of Shola’s favorite books) and the wedding poem that Carrie Bradshaw wrote in Sex & the City—something I’d planned to include in my wedding since I saw the episode!

Shola got just a little choked up, but kept it together.

I did not.


After the ceremony we took a short boat ride to our cocktail hour.



And then it was time to celebrate!



Even though I didn’t have bridesmaids, I had to have a photo op with the girls.



Our cocktail hour was planned for outside, but due to a shower earlier that afternoon that soaked the lawn, it was moved to a nearby screened in porch that had a nice indoor/outdoor feel. Guests were greeted with our His & Hers cocktails. I choose a Rose Paloma (mezcal & tequila based, my favorite!) and Shola opted for Peaches & Bourbon for a nod to our southern setting.


We settled on a coffee table book for our guest book with gorgeous images of New York City inside. The sign next to it read “Taking your well wishes back to NYC.”

I’m always going to influencer events where fashion illustrators create amazing sketches of my look. I thought it would make for a unique experience and lovely favor for our wedding guests and so searched high and low for a fashion illustrator based in SC.

In keeping with the “Greenery” theme that won the most votes, BRIDES filled the reception space with palm leaves, cascading white floral & greenery arrangements of all sizes, and romantic candlelight.


 
Our first dance was to “Lovely Day” by Bill Withers. We wanted something classic and a bit upbeat. It’s one of Shola’s favorite oldies.




S’mores are a favorite dessert of mine! The S’mores cart is famous at the Montage Palmetto Bluff and was parked just outside our reception venue.

Shola comes from a Nigerian background, so after the cake cutting we slipped into Nigerian wedding attire for a Nigerian Money Dance. While we danced guests tossed bills on us to represent hopes for good fortune. It was a highlight of the night!

As the weather starts to cool down, it’s time to warm those tootsies up! I love a little shearling shoe situation to keep my feet feeling cozy whether out and about or at home, in a snow storm or while shopping on a Saturday. Speaking of,  you can shop my edit of shearling sneaks, slides, and boots above. I found them all on Shoes.com, one of my go-to sites for shoe shopping. They seem to always have those sold out styles that I can’t find elsewhere. And a giant selection of course. I’m always finding new brands on there. Now let’s talk about these teddy bear faux shearling kicks from Tretron. These are by far my new favorite kicks! Taking comfy chic to the next lev. I styled them up two ways for ya. Scroll away!

The Canadian Tuxedo is a classic made even better when you’re sporting one in heritage denim. I love those brands that have a history, that have been around for years. Brands like Jordache, the one I’m wearing, give a quiet narrative and attitude to you’re look, and personally make me feel just a little bit cooler. Jordache started during the coolest area there is after all—the 70s. And, it was sported by all the major supermodels of the 80s and 90s. So basically, here I am feeling like my coolest supermodel self. I love this jacket for it’s two tone details and you know I’m happy in any pair high rise denim. These pieces look great together and can be paired separately with just about anything in your closet. Shop my edit of pieces above from heritage brands from back in the day to love for years to come.

Fall is my time to mix it up. I love pairing different prints and textures and going for cozy layered looks. It’s also a time when I find myself mixing it up with my beauty and skincare products. One thing I’m trying for the first time is natural deodorant. I’ve of course been hearing about the health dangers of many of the deodorants out there for a while now, so I’m finally trying to make the switch to au naturel. I also heard that easing into a natural deodorant can take a few days for your body to get used to, so I feel like fall is the perfect time to transition.  I’ll be sweating a little less and covering up a little more. Native asked me to try one of their seasonal sticks and I went for, what else, Pumpkin Spice Latte! Yes, they go all out with festive fall scents. How freakin cute is that! I’m sure there are a lot of Pumpkin Spice Latte lovers out there, so consider this one more way to ring in fall with your fave.

Native also has a travel size set with their best selling scents + fall favorites. I ordered this too!

GET THE LOOK:
Statement earrings are once again trending. This time around, make a cheeky choice like these Vodka earrings. Wear them out for drinks, on the town, or anytime you’re craving a cocktail (basically at the end of every busy week for me). Let’s just call these my Friday through Sunday earrings. Next up, I need to get my hands on the champagne and caviar styles from Mignonne Gavigan to bring those vibes into fruition. Love all of their cheeky chic styles. Shop my edit above to give your earlobes a little sparkle.

Finally sharing a few pics from our honeymoon! After our BRIDES Live Wedding, the team sent us to gorgeous Cayman Islands to relax and keep the celebration going. Keep scrolling for snaps throughout our week long honeymoon + my eat/sleep/do list while in Cayman Islands.

Luxury Cayman Villas spoiled us with a dream home on the water.
Where’s Shola? Lol.

When on your honeymoon, I highly recommend a private beach in your own backyard.

Our dreamy backyard also included an epic pool situation with two hot tubs.


I love collecting sea shells while on vacay. This one was a beaut!
I have this thing with outdoor showers.


Paddleboarding and kayaking were an unexpected daily activity for us. The villa provided a few!

Saved the best for last. We also had our own private doc off our backyard beach. Perfect for a lunchtime picnic or evening cuddle sesh outdoors.

As part of BRIDES Live Wedding, you also had the chance to vote for an activity that we did while on our honeymoon. The Sky & Sand package won, and so we embarked on a helicopter tour to Little Cayman for a picnic on the beach + snorkeling while there. This was our view from above…

…and this was our chic AF private picnic on the beach.

Peppers || We went there three times in one week. Need I say more?
Mango Tree || For no frills authentic food
Bacaro || Waterfront dining and the best dessert!
Luxury Cayman Villas  || there are several impeccably decorated properties
Bioluminescent Tour || Our favorite part of our trip! Cayman Islands is also one of the few places  with an year round bioluminescent bay. I highly recommend taking a kayak over the bottom glass boat. No photos to share because this is an experience that can’t be captured by everyday cameras. You must truly live in and soak up the moment!
Helicopter Tour with Cayman Helicopters || The water is so beautiful from above!
Day trip or overnight to Little Cayman || If you like a more off the beaten path vibe, this little island delivers!
Royal Palms Beach Club || For day party vibes
—
Also, special thank you to Cayman Airways for our first class seats & the comfiest of flights!

Happy & safe travels!

We New Yorkers need a lot of coats and this new one checks off all my boxes. It’s relaxed and not rigid, thin enough to layer, and cozy AF. Definitely prime to be my go-to piece all late fall and winter long. Look out for me pairing it with a peasant dress and boots or layered under a midi length coat on particularly blustry days. You might notice as you’re scrolling through that it’s also reversible! You can go fuzzy arms out for more of a statement or fuzzy arms in for a sleeker look.

You can’t go wrong with a combo of black, gold, and leopard. I’ve been buying up leopard print shoes for fall like it’s my job. Wait, it kind of is my job. Hehe. This Louise et Cie tuxedo shoe  is one of my current faves with it’s almond toe, grosgrain laces, and slight heel. I loved the idea of dressing them up as you see here for a more casual evening out. I’ll wear them with boyfriend denim by day for work or weekends. You can shop my edit of more fall shoes I’m currently eyeing in leopard, black, and gold from Louise et Cie above. It’s a brand I’ve recently discovered. The shoes are trendy, yet elegant and the pricing is so right. All of these are under $15o!
Happy Shopping.

I’m constantly changing things up in my bedroom. I love to redecorate and bring in new vibes, but it also has a lot to do with lack of storage. Being a lover of clothing, accessories, and the occasional beauty find (and having a job that encourages me to feed my habit) means that I’m in constant need of creative storage solutions. My latest hack is this low boy dresser that’s doubling as my night stand. The three drawers I’ve gained are being used as much needed storage for small bags and clutches + beauty products I’m sent to try out. The dresser is from the PB Apartment line so it has a slimmer footprint than others you might come across, designed especially for small spaces when every inch of floor space counts. The dresser comes assembled (so nice!) accept for the legs. I recommend leaving them off like I did so that the dresser height lines up nicely with your bed just like a nightstand would. Shop my edit above for a few other small space pieces I’m currently eyeing.

I think the image above sums up my feelings right about now. It’s all happening! The votes are in and the wedding planning is under way! Thank you so much to everyone who voted for our favorites on Instagram. I hope you enjoyed helping me and the BRIDES team iron out the details. We are now less than two months away from heading down to Montage Palmetto Bluff and I am nervous, excited, anxious, overwelmed and all of the things! You can catch me in the next issue of BRIDES mag with my thoughts on some of the winning wedding components.  I especially can’t wait for you to see my Maggie Sottero dress! And you know Sexy Hair will have the best wedding hair looks.

Brooke Keegan has been the best wedding planner you guys! Her experience has made planning a cinch! Shola will have his first fitting at Men’s Wearhouse this week and I can’t wait to see him again looking sharp as always in a suit. My sister and I wanted her to have a printed bridesmaid’s dress so Plum Pretty Sugar has been a perfect match. They have prints galore (and lovely solid options too)! Paired with Kendra Scott  jewelry she’ll add casual glamour to our destination wedding. Although I don’t have a big bridal party, I wanted to have friends close on my big day, so I’ll be asking them to stop by my bridal suite for a sip of Rosa Regale while I get ready. Our Crate & Barrel registry is all set. I’m especially obsessed with all the Cuisinart pieces we registered for. I guess I’ll have to start cooking after the wedding!
Stay tuned for a full recap of our wedding and Cayman Islands honeymoon. August 4th can’t come soon enough!!

If you live in NYC or get inspired by NYC street style then you must have a classic black cashmere crewneck sweater in your arsenal. It’s crazy how something can be so simple and classic, yet feel very fashion forward. Plus, come fall/winter, cashmere is the hands down chicest way to be warm and stylish at once. I usually stock up on a few cashmere pieces come fall from Uniqlo. The price is right and the styles they carry leave little to be desired. Shop my edit of this years sweaters above. And while you’re at it, pick up a cashmere scarf & cap and you’ll be set for the cooler weather ahead.

If you’ve been following along on Instagram, then you probably know that I got engaged to this gorgeous man last year. You may have also seen the announcement last week that we’ve been chosen as this year’s couple for BRIDES Live Wedding! Each year, BRIDES puts on a dream wedding for one lucky couple and this year, it’s us!! The date is set for August 4th and we couldn’t be more excited for our big day. But here’s the really fun part…
YOU get to help us plan it! Voting has kicked off over on the @Brides Instagram stories using the fun polling feature. Check out their stories each day to vote on the 8 categories:

Now, I know what you’re thinking. How could she let America pick her wedding dress!? But here’s the thing, I would have been trying on dresses forever because I love so many different styles…and I love shopping! This opportunity has taken off so much of the pressure of wedding planning for us, and allowed us to just enjoy being engaged. We have the insanely talented Brooke Keegan doing the planning (she has planned stunning weddings for high profile athletes and celebs, no big deal!) , not to mention the entire BRIDES editorial team (hello, impeccable taste). Plus, I’ll be weighing in with our favorites for each category on my own Instagram stories and reminding you to vote so you can help ensure our dream wedding comes to life. Be sure to follow me @waityouneedthis so you don’t miss a thing!
Keep scrolling for an excerpt of my interview with BRIDES magazine and catch Shola and I in the May issue on newsstands now!


BRIDES: Why are you excited to be a part of BRIDES Live Wedding?
Janelle: We aren’t the type to throw big parties for ourselves, especially since my mom is undergoing breast cancer treatment. [We’re happy to say she’s now a survivor!] Brides will help us plan a celebration fitting of the love we share.
BRIDES: What’s your vision for the big day?
Janelle: We’re not overly traditional, so I’d love for our wedding to feel relaxed. I love an outdoor bohemian setting, palm trees, tropical vibes with a shot of glamour. Signature his and hers cocktails and a dessert truck have always been a part of my yes-list as well!
BRIDES: How do you like the venue BRIDES selected, Montage Palmetto Bluff in South Carolina?
Janelle: I couldn’t be happier about it. I’m obsessed with all the Spanish moss in Palmetto Bluff, plus my dad’s parents moved to New York from South Carolina so it’s a meaningful location for my family. Random, but one of my wishes was to have a fire pit at the rehearsal dinner and they have an area with three pits and a s’mores roast!
BRIDES: What gets your heart pounding when you think of your wedding?
Janelle: Aside from marrying the man of my dreams? I can’t wait to see how it all comes together with BRIDES at the helm!

Whether with wide legs or skinnies, dresses or jumpsuits, chelsea boots are a staple that every city girl should own. This pair is built to last and the comfiest I’ve owned. I have chelsea boots in quite a few colors and patterns. I suggest shopping the edit above for three colors you’ll wear again and again. Sperry has the formula for comfort + style down pat, so they’re a good place to start for a boot that you’ll keep for years.

GET THE LOOK:
Working out is always more fun when you have a cute look! And when it’s this cute I’m down to wear it to run errands, to my go-to coffee shop to catch up on work, or maybe even to a low key brunch with girlfriends. My weekends are often a blur and sometimes a girl just needs an outfit that let’s her move through it with serious comfort and style. I’ve been stocking up on pieces from Reebok and love it for the nostalgic heritage, yet modern vibes. Forget a top and go for a sports bra that can double as crop top like there Pure Move bra or this cute one shoulder . They also have loads of leggings that are stylish enough to wear weather you’re working out or werking it. And you’ve probably noticed that I’ve had their classic white kicks on heavy rotation. You can shop my edit of sporty separates above to get the all weekend workout look.

SHOP OUR EDIT:
My man and I love our blazers. I might have almost as many as him now!  So it’s only natural that we end up matching from time to time. This jacket and pants have become fast staples for him for work or weekend occasions. With his 6’4″ height (read: long arms, broad shoulders, narrow neck, and slim frame) he’s used to getting EVERYTHING tailored, but Bonobos seems to have fits for all tastes and sizes. He gets his pieces in “Tailored” fit, which is the sleekest fit Bonobos offers. I love that he’s playing with prints now, too like this check + polka dot combo! I also got him to order a flamingo print in the same Jetsetter Stretch fabric for our next vacay. He’s sold on the feel and fit of the shirt, so I think I can get him to try just about any color or print I like! I highly recommend putting your guy onto Bonobos for ease of shopping whether for everyday workwear, weekend vibes, or a special occasion. Shop Shola’s edit of printed shirts, classic suits, and of course, blazers above.
Happy shopping!

SHOP LOAFERS:
I shared earlier this month that I’m taking part in Sperry’s challenge to redefine preppy. I had never worn loafers before, but love the timeless silhouette so I’ve been game for finding ways to blend Sperry’s classic (and oh-so-comfy I might add) loafer styles into my daily looks. For this round of looks, I took inspiration from across the pond. British style darlings like Alexa Chung consistently make loafers look chic, pairing them with mini skirts, feminine blouses, and oversized blazers by the boat load. I was pleasantly surprised to find that these were all pieces I already had in my arsenal—just add loafers and voila! Shop my loafer edit above and be sure to add this embellished Kiltie style with it’s touch of fringe and hint of fur to your transitional dressing must-have list. They’ll have you effortlessly cruising into fall.

Cropped, high-waisted, and preferably wide-legged. Lately, I can’t wear my denim any other way. This pair is the latest in my growing collection of denim of the exact aforementioned specifications. Unique to these are the super frayed hem that give them a perfectly lived-in, edgy vibe. I like pairing them with more polished pieces like this oversized blazer and dainty heel, but they’ll look equally amaze with a crop sweater or band tee. Bloomie’s has been a denim source for me since my early days working there as an assistant buyer. It was my very first job out of college and it was where I learned about all the cool and classic denim brands that a woman should invest in and have in her arsenal. I still have my very first pair of “designer” jeans that I purchased with my first pay check—and it looks like bootcut might be making a comeback! Lol. You can get my look above and shop a few other cropped/high-waist/wide leg wonders I’m currently eyeing from Bloomingdale’s. To me, they’re the perfect denim trend to wisk you right into fall. A little breathing room and a peak of skin for those still warmish days.
Happy shopping!

Shop my edit:
Don’t you love those moments when you realize you have the perfect oufit to wear to something you’ve just been invited to attend? I recently had the chance to go glamping and was probably a bit too excited to have the perfect look for the occasion. This jumpsuit was ideal for exploring the camp grounds, gazing into binoculars, and making s’mores. I’m a firm believer in looking festive. It’s just so much more fun when you dress the part! Shop my edit above for more exlporer approved styles from Banana Republic. Think comfy/chic jumpsuits in khaki and olive green, a fabulous wide brim hat to shade you from the sun, and layering pieces to take you through a day of adventure.


All these pieces are city approved as well. Just add a strappy heel or crisp white kicks!

We camped at Collective Retreats. It’s the cutest staycation idea for NYCers. While you’re on Governor’s Island, go for a bike ride and check out Island Oyster for the cool vibes and yummy cocktails.

Say cheese!

When I saw the shirt I’m wearing in this post, I laughed to myself and thought, yep, basically my mantra! For me, it’s about that unapologetically female, not mistaking my softness for weakness, boss babe mentality that I try to live by every day. And a motto that as women, we can’t afford not to uphold.I love that Reebok is embracing this attitude for it’s latest #BeMoreHuman campaign. I felt humbled and honored when asked to be a part of their movement that celebrates women that move through the world in a way that inspires. You may have seen the likes of Gal Gadot (oh, hey Wonder Woman) and Danai Gurira (of Black Panther fame, nbd) sporting a tee or tank like mine on a billboard near you.

GET THE LOOK:
Biker shorts, issa trend. If  you follow street style, you’ve probably noticed Kim K, Hailey Baldwin, or maybe Emily Ratajkowski rocking biker shorts like it’s their job. Get full on into this newest take on athleisure and pair biker shorts with a sports bra and kicks. I like Reebok for it’s nostalgic feel, and so opted for their classic white sneakers (p.s. you’ll be wearing these with everything from jeans to dresses) and a matching logo bra. A fanny pack in lieu of a purse keeps the sporty vibe alive. Shop my edit of sporty pieces from Reebok above that are sure to uplevel your athleisure street style game. Thinking I might outfit repeat this look for fashion week.

Midsummer means I’m deep into wearing only the breeziest pieces that give me all the staycation vibes. At the top of my list are printed dresses, flowy crop pants, and light knits that are perfect to throw in your bag and layer on. After all, who knows where a New York City summer day will take you!

With National Sister’s Day around the corner, I had to ask Jessie to make a little cameo in this post! Here we are on a post brunch stroll, picking up flowers for the week ahead. It’s one of our weekend rituals when we can get away from our busy lives for a much needed catch up sesh.

Sunflowers are one of our faves to fill up our apartments with come summer!

Scroll through my edit of summer perfect dresses, prints, and knits from LOFT. You can always find good staple pieces there, plus a few statement makers. And they are always having the best sales so it’s worth checking out!

At first glance you might think, too preppy. But take a closer look.  Sperry challenged me to redefine “preppy” and mix their loafer style to make it my own.  Penny loafers make me think of white dress shirts and I wanted to stay true to that. After all, your outfit should kind of have a story so it doesn’t feel too thrown together. I liked the idea of going a bit bohemian (surprise, surprise) and wearing a slubby laid back take on a button down.


 
Paired with a flare crop pant with frayed edges and layered gold necklaces, my look feels relaxed and timeless.  I think I feel a new uniform coming on! Whether classic pennies, mules, or sporty, the loafer look is a fun summer alternative and will transition seamlessly into fall. You can shop my edit of Sperry’s loafers above.


 
I must say that this pair is the comfiest loafer I’ve tried. Move over sneakers. And the leather is wearing quite nicely so far. I’m excited for this new addition to my wardrobe and can’t wait to see how these babies wear over time.

Whether you’re into statement pieces or more fine jewelry, you’ll find something gorge.

If you’ve been following along on @waityouneedthis, then you know I’ve been obsessing over Mandy Moore’s recent home renovation since the first piece of terrazzo appeared on Instagram. The finished home is total decor goals and I just can’t get enough of it! I’ve come across one or two roundups to get the look, but I’m finding them a bit price prohibitive, so I thought I’d do a version that includes some more affordable options for you guys!
Now for a design tip:
When looking to recreate a look, you don’t have to search for the exact piece, or even a similar piece in the same color. Use the overall lines and color story from the space as inspiration. For example, if you can’t find a waterfall bench, try a a table in the same silhouette. Or if you love gold accents, but can’t afford a metallic coffee table, try a side table or lamps instead. Can’t find turquoise chairs? Try turquoise lamps and wall art. I hope you feel inspired and sorry (not sorry!) if after scrolling through this post you feel the need to completely redecorate your place.

My guy has a great classic style. He likes quality, understated pieces and is loyal to styles and fits he loves. He likes to keep things simple, and you’ll completely loose him if you call his look an outfit. When it comes to dressing up in summer, he prefers lightweight suits and easy layers, so when Bonobos reached out to ask us to style a summer wedding guest look, he was all in. Bonobos makes shopping simple with across the board sizing. Once you know his size, you’re set! No need to make him try on everything. Their lightweight tux is ideal for summer affairs. You won’t compromise comfort for appearance with this look. We switched up his usual tux style with a simple t-shirt, crisp white kicks, and no socks for some seasonally appropriate swag. Don’t forget a pocket square for that formal touch. A navy polka dot combo pops nicely against the black tux for something a bit unexpected.

If you’ve been following along on Instagram, then you probably know that I got engaged to this gorgeous man last year. You may have also seen the announcement last week that we’ve been chosen as this year’s couple for BRIDES Live Wedding! Each year, BRIDES puts on a dream wedding for one lucky couple and this year, it’s us!! The date is set for August 4th and we couldn’t be more excited for our big day. But here’s the really fun part…
YOU get to help us plan it! Voting has kicked off over on the @Brides Instagram stories using the fun polling feature. Check out their stories each day to vote on the 8 categories:

Now, I know what you’re thinking. How could she let America pick her wedding dress!? But here’s the thing, I would have been trying on dresses forever because I love so many different styles…and I love shopping! This opportunity has taken off so much of the pressure of wedding planning for us, and allowed us to just enjoy being engaged. We have the insanely talented Brooke Keegan doing the planning (she has planned stunning weddings for high profile athletes and celebs, no big deal!) , not to mention the entire BRIDES editorial team (hello, impeccable taste). Plus, I’ll be weighing in with our favorites for each category on my own Instagram stories and reminding you to vote so you can help ensure our dream wedding comes to life. Be sure to follow me @waityouneedthis so you don’t miss a thing!
Keep scrolling for an excerpt of my interview with BRIDES magazine and catch Shola and I in the May issue on newsstands now!


BRIDES: Why are you excited to be a part of BRIDES Live Wedding?
Janelle: We aren’t the type to throw big parties for ourselves, especially since my mom is undergoing breast cancer treatment. [We’re happy to say she’s now a survivor!] Brides will help us plan a celebration fitting of the love we share.
BRIDES: What’s your vision for the big day?
Janelle: We’re not overly traditional, so I’d love for our wedding to feel relaxed. I love an outdoor bohemian setting, palm trees, tropical vibes with a shot of glamour. Signature his and hers cocktails and a dessert truck have always been a part of my yes-list as well!
BRIDES: How do you like the venue BRIDES selected, Montage Palmetto Bluff in South Carolina?
Janelle: I couldn’t be happier about it. I’m obsessed with all the Spanish moss in Palmetto Bluff, plus my dad’s parents moved to New York from South Carolina so it’s a meaningful location for my family. Random, but one of my wishes was to have a fire pit at the rehearsal dinner and they have an area with three pits and a s’mores roast!
BRIDES: What gets your heart pounding when you think of your wedding?
Janelle: Aside from marrying the man of my dreams? I can’t wait to see how it all comes together with BRIDES at the helm!

When summer comes, my friends and I look for every excuse to be outside. I love to have gatherings in my apartment buildings outdoor space, but because it’s shared, there’s not a tone of time to prep or fawn over every detail. I’m no Martha Stewart, but I’ve honed my skills for entertaining outdoors with a few simple elements that will help you and your soiree look totally pulled together. Keep scrolling for them all!
Keep it simple by offering one signature cocktail. You can tell friends you’ll be serving a Ketel Botanicals & Soda or other universally yummy libation and that they’re also welcome to BYOB. A signature cocktail helps set the vibe and always serving one will quickly become your signature!
 
Monstera leaves are my all time go to when it comes to simple table settings. Just purchase a bundle and spread them flat on the table in a perfectly imperfect way.  They’re like a tablecloth, placemat, and centerpiece all in one! We then added succulents and a few lanterns to the mix for a lush, textured feeling table.
For food, no need to have a full on menu planned. Choose pretty bowls and plates and fill them with your favorite (weather appropriate) snacks. Your guests will graze as they chat it up.

I’m a firm believer in capturing moments, and I want my guests to look great for them! Don’t feel shy about suggesting an easy dress code like prints, neutrals, or wearing a flower in your hair. Choose something simple that everyone likely has in their closet anyway.

Little details like cute cocktail napkins and festive drink accessories are a memorable touch your guests will appreciate. I prefer festive cloth napkins that can be reused, but you can also find fancy paper products that make cleaning a cinch!

It’s almost Father’s Day. Got gifts? Skip the boring tie or simple card and gift him something unexpected. Here’s what I’m eyeing for the dads on my list.

For the Workaholic // His briefcase gets beat up day after day. Upgrade him with a classic in black leather that will stand the test of time.
For the Music Fan // Whether he has a dusty old vinyl collection or loves to share his latest Spotify playlist, a record player adds a hint of nostalgia that he’ll appreciate for years to come.
For the Style Aficionado // Inject some chic masculinity into his living room decor with a stylish coffee table look. It’s an area that even the most stylish guy might overlook.
For the Coffee Enthusiast // If “but first, coffee” is his motto, he’ll appreciate the  Keurig® K-Elite™ single serve functionality. Available in grey or black, it’s the perfect masculine touch.
For the Retiree // The retired dad needs a fun hobby. Photography fits the bill with cool retro cameras with techy bells and whistles.
For the Style Novice // If shopping is not is forte, a subscription box of stylish pieces is totally his lane.
 
 I hope you have a lovely Father’s Day with all the dads in your life!

I think the image above sums up my feelings right about now. It’s all happening! The votes are in and the wedding planning is under way! Thank you so much to everyone who voted for our favorites on Instagram. I hope you enjoyed helping me and the BRIDES team iron out the details. We are now less than two months away from heading down to Montage Palmetto Bluff and I am nervous, excited, anxious, overwelmed and all of the things! You can catch me in the next issue of BRIDES mag with my thoughts on some of the winning wedding components.  I especially can’t wait for you to see my Maggie Sottero dress! And you know Sexy Hair will have the best wedding hair looks.

Brooke Keegan has been the best wedding planner you guys! Her experience has made planning a cinch! Shola will have his first fitting at Men’s Wearhouse this week and I can’t wait to see him again looking sharp as always in a suit. My sister and I wanted her to have a printed bridesmaid’s dress so Plum Pretty Sugar has been a perfect match. They have prints galore (and lovely solid options too)! Paired with Kendra Scott  jewelry she’ll add casual glamour to our destination wedding. Although I don’t have a big bridal party, I wanted to have friends close on my big day, so I’ll be asking them to stop by my bridal suite for a sip of Rosa Regale while I get ready. Our Crate & Barrel registry is all set. I’m especially obsessed with all the Cuisinart pieces we registered for. I guess I’ll have to start cooking after the wedding!
Stay tuned for a full recap of our wedding and Cayman Islands honeymoon. August 4th can’t come soon enough!!

I recently had the lovely opportunity to stop by Burberry HQ and have my make up done by the one and only Wendy Rowe to celebrate Burberry’s latest complexion product, Fresh Glow Stick Gel. I always covet glowing skin. Whenever an artist does my makeup I ask the same thing. “Can you just make me look glowy?” I don’t always get what I want, but Fresh Glow Stick Gel is made for a glowy looking complexion.

I chatted with Wendy about the new product and then she went to work on giving me a glowing, radiant look. She seemed to feel her way through the entire application, using her fingers instead of this brush for this and that brush for that, and going back to products she had already used. She kept saying that you really can’t make mistakes with these product, which was so refreshing to hear. The stick is super easy to apply and throw in your bag on the go, too. I’m also loving using a lighter shade as a concealer!

Another product from the day that I was into is the Fresh Glow highlighter. Just a few sweeps along your cheekbone and you instantly look fresh and…wait for it…glowy! Plus, I’m officially a color on my lower lids girl! Wendy applied a bronzey color right along my lower lash line (same color that she used on my upper lid) and gently smudged it in. So easy to recreate! After my appointment, I took the products home to create a look myself. What do you think?
Burberry Beauty’s Fresh Glow Stick Gel is now available at Sephora. Get your glow in a stick.

The unofficial first weekend of summer is here! That means it’s time to break out your easiest, breeziest style and show a little leg. A good shorts co-ord set is a no-brainer way to pull a look together. This one from LOFT reads like a romper, but you can just as easily break the look apart and wear the top with white denim or the shorts as a beach cover up. Plus, the color is so Memorial Day ready! Shop my LOFT edit of shorts, tops, and statement earrings (can’t seem to get enough of them lately) above and be ready for the summer sun. The billowy and more embellished, the better.

The entire LOFT site is currently 40% off for it’s Memorial Day sale, so there’s no better time to shop!

It’s almost here! The much anticipated royal wedding! You know you and all your girls will be watching, so why not throw a viewing party and drool over Megan’s dress together?! Festivities start airing bright and early at 7am EST, so go for a pajama party themed breakfast. Keep things “royal” with a luxe, silky pajamas dress code and supply crown photo props to help capture the moment. You’ll want to serve English Breakfast tea and an assortment of hot and cold coffees to perk guests up. The Keurig® K-Elite™ with it’s quick single serve situation will allow you to give guests whichever beverage they prefer.  Serve everything in heart shaped mugs to ensure romance will be in the air all morning. To nibble on, try the Queen’s own drop scone recipe! Lastly, you’ll need loads of floor pillow “thrones” for your guests to sit on.
 

Have fun at your viewing party! I’ll be watching along with you bright and early.
<< Congrats Meghan & Harry >>

The unofficial first weekend of summer is here! That means it’s time to break out your easiest, breeziest style and show a little leg. A good shorts co-ord set is a no-brainer way to pull a look together. This one from LOFT reads like a romper, but you can just as easily break the look apart and wear the top with white denim or the shorts as a beach cover up. Plus, the color is so Memorial Day ready! Shop my LOFT edit of shorts, tops, and statement earrings (can’t seem to get enough of them lately) above and be ready for the summer sun. The billowy and more embellished, the better.

The entire LOFT site is currently 40% off for it’s Memorial Day sale, so there’s no better time to shop!

Do you change scents from season to season? Well it’s time to treat yourself to a new spring/summer scent! I love marking a new season with a new fragrance. Spring and summer scents are hands down my favorite.

They can be fresh or floral. Crisp or warm. One thing that they always do for me is perk me up in the morning and set the tone for the day. Because even if you’re going into the office, you can still smell like you just ran through a field of flowers. The city can be so hectic sometimes and us busy girl bosses have to know how to find a little peace in all the crazy, amiright?

I discovered Tocca fragrances at Sephora and I love the meaning behind the scent. I picked up Tocca Maya, which has a rare combination of ingredients that is meant to exude confidence and strength of character. It’s a floral scent that feels feminine, warm, and a bit complicated. Kinda like yours truly 🙂 It reminds me of long summer strolls through Central Park after the rain…you know, that fresh and almost sweet scent that exhales from the ground like a sigh after a long hot day. Find the fragrance that’s right for you and switch it up this season. You never know how your new scent might inspire you.

If you’ve been following along on Instagram, then you probably know that I got engaged to this gorgeous man last year. You may have also seen the announcement last week that we’ve been chosen as this year’s couple for BRIDES Live Wedding! Each year, BRIDES puts on a dream wedding for one lucky couple and this year, it’s us!! The date is set for August 4th and we couldn’t be more excited for our big day. But here’s the really fun part…
YOU get to help us plan it! Voting has kicked off over on the @Brides Instagram stories using the fun polling feature. Check out their stories each day to vote on the 8 categories:

Now, I know what you’re thinking. How could she let America pick her wedding dress!? But here’s the thing, I would have been trying on dresses forever because I love so many different styles…and I love shopping! This opportunity has taken off so much of the pressure of wedding planning for us, and allowed us to just enjoy being engaged. We have the insanely talented Brooke Keegan doing the planning (she has planned stunning weddings for high profile athletes and celebs, no big deal!) , not to mention the entire BRIDES editorial team (hello, impeccable taste). Plus, I’ll be weighing in with our favorites for each category on my own Instagram stories and reminding you to vote so you can help ensure our dream wedding comes to life. Be sure to follow me @waityouneedthis so you don’t miss a thing!
Keep scrolling for an excerpt of my interview with BRIDES magazine and catch Shola and I in the May issue on newsstands now!


BRIDES: Why are you excited to be a part of BRIDES Live Wedding?
Janelle: We aren’t the type to throw big parties for ourselves, especially since my mom is undergoing breast cancer treatment. [We’re happy to say she’s now a survivor!] Brides will help us plan a celebration fitting of the love we share.
BRIDES: What’s your vision for the big day?
Janelle: We’re not overly traditional, so I’d love for our wedding to feel relaxed. I love an outdoor bohemian setting, palm trees, tropical vibes with a shot of glamour. Signature his and hers cocktails and a dessert truck have always been a part of my yes-list as well!
BRIDES: How do you like the venue BRIDES selected, Montage Palmetto Bluff in South Carolina?
Janelle: I couldn’t be happier about it. I’m obsessed with all the Spanish moss in Palmetto Bluff, plus my dad’s parents moved to New York from South Carolina so it’s a meaningful location for my family. Random, but one of my wishes was to have a fire pit at the rehearsal dinner and they have an area with three pits and a s’mores roast!
BRIDES: What gets your heart pounding when you think of your wedding?
Janelle: Aside from marrying the man of my dreams? I can’t wait to see how it all comes together with BRIDES at the helm!

We recently had some friends visiting for an extended stay and I really wanted them to feel at home. They are big coffee lovers so I knew they would be delighted to wake up to a sweet coffee bar each morning. Creating an at-home coffee bar was simple and fun to pull together.
 First, you’ll need a Keurig for easy at home brewing. This one is the new Keurig® K-Elite™ coffee maker. It works well for our household because I’m not an everyday coffee drinker and my fiancé, Shola, drinks it on the daily. It also has the simplest controls, is super quiet (important in our tiny home), and brews tea, hot cocoa, and iced coffee too! My favorite part of the coffee bar is the letter board. I had fun changing the message each morning for our guests. Keep scrolling for a checklist for everything you need to create your own at-home coffee bar, plus a few inspiring morning quotes for your coffee bar letter board.

Here’s all you need to create your own coffee bar at home:

Yes, that’s Galetine’s Day with  a “G” ladies! If you don’t know, Galetine’s Day is traditional celebrated on February 13th and is a celebration of friendship between gal pals (thanks Leslie Knope). For Galentine’s Day with my  girls, I  like to embrace  my “girlie” side with touches like florals, ruffles and high heels. Ann Taylor has a perfectly playful floral print right now that comes in a silhouette for just about every style sensibility. You can shop and edit of my favorites above, plus cool  girl jeans and heels to complete the look! Speaking of heels, would you believe I’ve been without a pair of black pumps for years! This suede pair is a welcome addition to my wardrobe. At just over 3″ inches, the heel height is sexy, yet sensible and the flower embellishment adds that little something so you’re not stuck in a boring black pump. Not to mention they look expensive AF  and are under $150.

The Galentine’s Day dinner took place at the lovely Gramercy Terrace and was complete with yummy eats, a killer panel discussion with boss babe founders, and endless conversation about topics from career to wedding planning to buying your first place. The blogging community can feel isolating and competitive at times, so it’s great to sit down with like-minded women, share our struggles and successes, and show LOVE for each other.
Happy Galentine’s Day!

Ive’ been trying to get more serious about my skincare, and the easiest way to feel like I’m making an effort has been to get serious about SPF. But as you’ve probably heard,  you need to reapply your SPF every two hours to be fully protected. I’m like, “umm, I have a full face of makeup on so forget it.” Well, Supergoop! felt our pain and launched a new SPF 45 in setting powder form.

Use it to set your makeup in the morning and then dust it on throughout the day to refresh your SPF. I went for translucent because I’m used to using setting powder in that shade, but it comes in light, medium, and deep as well.

Now, I chatted with the Supergoop! team and think it’s important to mention that this should not replace whatever other SPFs you’ve woven into your routine. I use Supergoop!’s Unseen as a base (after a toner and serum) and eye cream with SPF around my peepers, followed by a BB cream with SPF, and finish off my makeup application with the setting powder for three total layers of UV protection. I’d also recommend a hat for days you’ll be walking out and about outside.

Plus, I take extra care every single day to protect my eye area and never leave home without a great pair of sunnies or a hat to block my eyes from unnecessary sun exposure. Pro tip: Because I’m always protecting my face, I like to use a sunless tanner—especially in winter months—to give myself a healthy looking glow.

Shop my edit of SPF products from Supergoop.com above to follow the skincare steps I mentioned. You can also find them at Sephora.
Happy SPFing!

SHOP MY SWEAT EDIT:
Strolling around New York first thing in the morning before the city gets to crowded is one of my favorite things to do. I’ll put on one of my strutting soundtracks and go for a long walk through my hood. I start by grabbing a juice (I’m obsessed with beet juice right now) and head out for some fresh flowers or to my go-to magazine stand. It’s one of the ways I practice self care. So is being comfy. While I like to be comfortable, for me looking good is part of feeling good no matter the time of day. I found a load of crazy soft sweatpants and sweatshirts while shopping the Lou & Grey site. Theirs have subtle fashion forward elements like extra long side slits, playful stripes, and come in great color palettes that set them apart from the boring sweats you’re used to. I’m digging the flared legs on this pair of sweats so much! They’ll give you instant cool girl vibes for your next morning stroll.

Lately, I’ve been cheating on fashion with skincare. As we age our effortlessly radiant skin isn’t second nature, and so I’m always on the hunt for products that promise to maintain my youthful glow. L’Occitane just launched a new line of advanced skincare that’s packed with organic Immortelle essential oil. (You may have spotted me at their super cute launch party on my Instagram stories.) After a quick google, I learned that Immortelle is a floral oil and has been used throughout history to achieve everlasting radiance. Yes, please! It’s beautifying benefits nourish skin and help reduce factors that contribute to the appearance of aging. I’ll share the 5 step process below that I’ve just started using. Will be sure to let you know how it’s going and let me know the same in the comments if you decide to buy!

Here’s a link to the Divine Collection starter set!

Step 1: Divine Cleansing Balm. This stuff really melts into your skin to dissolve makeup and creates a lovely massage moment to perk up skin in the morning or for little self care at the end of the busy day.
Step 2: Divine Foaming Cleansing Cream. It turns to foam once you add water. Not over drying at all.
Step 3: Divine Eyes. Eyes are the most important part to looking youthful if you ask me. This is an instant pick me up.
Step 4: Divine Youth Oil. I’ve been really into oils so I love that an oil is a part of the collection. I like to warm it up between my fingertips before applying.
Step 5: Divine Cream. In a rush? Add the Youth Oil to the cream and make it just four steps. Don’t forget to apply the cream all the way down to your decolletage.

SHOP UNEXPECTED SPRING FINDS:
By now, you likely already have those spring staples in your closet that every girl needs—a breezy blouse, maxi skirts, cropped denim, etc. So why not think outside the box and add a few unexpected pieces to your spring rotation. Now, you know I’m a sucker for a high-waist. The higher the better. S0, I’m excited to add a few crop tops to my wardrobe to complement my preferred high-waist silhouette. This blouse gets major bonus points for being long sleeve. Spring is all about transitional dressing and, so it’s nice to be able to show just a bit of skin. And how cute is the bow? You have the option to tie it as big or small as you like, or even just tie it in a knot. I went with an exaggerated bow. It just feels more fashion that way!


Wearing EGGIE Bella Blouse

So, I’m kind of obsessed with this robe. The color combination is perfection and the floral print is sophisticated. I can’t wait to layer it over a white midi or maxi dress and at home around the house as well! It’s versatile, cheery, and I’ve never owned anything like it before.
Shop more unexpected spring finds like high-waist shorts with a ruffle hem or a melon print co-ord set in my edit above and happy Spring!

If you marched yesterday, caught the coverage in the news, or spied the crowds of like-minded communities while scrolling through your IG feed, then like me, you’re probably still high on all the fem feels. It’s undeniable that the future is female. So in that spirit, here’s another dose of to keep the vibes going. I combed the web for ten kick ass quotes that speak to me from women who have paved the way. Grab your girl power gear and let’s do this.
2018, we’re ready for ya…

“I’m tough, I’m ambitious, and I know exactly what I want. If that makes me a bitch, okay.” ―Madonna

“I love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels. Life’s a bitch. You’ve got to go out and kick ass.” —Maya Angelou
“Feminism isn’t about making women strong. Women are already strong. It’s about changing the way the world perceives that strength.” —G.D. Anderson

“I am a woman with thoughts and questions and shit to say. I say if I’m beautiful. I say if I’m strong. You will not determine my story–I will.” —Amy Schumer
“Of course I am not worried about intimidating men. The type of man who will be intimidated by me is exactly the type of man I have no interest in.” ―Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

“I’ve never met a woman who is not strong, but sometimes they don’t let it out. Then there’s a tragedy, and then all of a sudden that strength comes. My message is let the strength come out before the tragedy.” —Diane von Furstenberg
“If you want something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman.” —Margaret Thatcher

“I just love bossy women. I could be around them all day. To me, bossy is not a pejorative term at all. It means somebody’s passionate and engaged and ambitious and doesn’t mind leading.” —Amy Poehler
“Who run the world? Girls.” —Beyoncé

Fun fact: My absolute favorite show is Sex and the City. I watch it pretty much daily! My one frustration about the show is how Carrie constantly runs around town in the dead of winter with her coat wide open.No way is she warm enough, but I do love the idea of wearing my winter coats open. I mean, this one doesn’t even have a zipper (insert head shake from fiance here over said lack of zipper). Coats just always seem to look chicer when open, don’t they? Plus, you can see the fabulous outfit you’ve spent your time styling up underneath. So what’s my trick for winter layers that let you go coat open? Cashmere, baby, cashmere.I’ve been slowly growing my collection of cashmere sweaters over the years and I promise, it’s worth the splurge. No matter how thin the layer, a 100% cashmere piece never fails to keep me warmer than the thickest of sweaters made with blends, or worse, a synthetic. This cashmere cardi has been a go-to layering piece. The slightly cropped silhouette works perfectly with my many pairs of high-waisted denim and the feminine tie detail and blouson sleeve means it looks lovely layered over dresses, too!

Fun fact: My absolute favorite show is Sex and the City. I watch it pretty much daily! My one frustration about the show is how Carrie constantly runs around town in the dead of winter with her coat wide open.No way is she warm enough, but I do love the idea of wearing my winter coats open. I mean, this one doesn’t even have a zipper (insert head shake from fiance here over said lack of zipper). Coats just always seem to look chicer when open, don’t they? Plus, you can see the fabulous outfit you’ve spent your time styling up underneath. So what’s my trick for winter layers that let you go coat open? Cashmere, baby, cashmere.I’ve been slowly growing my collection of cashmere sweaters over the years and I promise, it’s worth the splurge. No matter how thin the layer, a 100% cashmere piece never fails to keep me warmer than the thickest of sweaters made with blends, or worse, a synthetic.

A super warm coat is pretty much a must in NYC once December hits, and especially into Jan and Feb. I’ve fought it for the longest, but after 11 years in the big apple, I’m finally adding a puffer coat to my collection. I’ve always stayed away from puffer styles because I couldn’t find one that was stylish enough and that I actually WANTED to wear. After years of “freezing” for fashion in the latest high street silhouettes that came in materials not quite warm enough for real winter, I’m happy to report that this Bernardo puffer is basically my first “real” winter coat, and I’m obsessed! It’s not the sporty puffer coat you’re used to. Think relaxed fit, drop shouldered, and boxy (in a good way). The army green color is an escape from the black coat uniform we New Yorkers tend to gravitate toward come colder months. And, since puffer coats are trending, I’ll be wearing it with jeans and dresses alike. Get ready for this puffer to make many a cameo on the blog!

This coat has been my trusty weekend and travel companion. It’s simply the comfiest. It’s also two coats in one! Flip it around when you want some winter white action. I’ll 100% be bringing it along for all my holiday travels. It doubled as the perfect blanket on my plane ride to Atlanta to see the fam.

I’m loving the idea of keeping it cool and casual for the holidays this year. For me, that means festive pants in lieu of party dresses, chunky heels, and boho vibes all around.
For this look, I went with a mash up of some of my favorite current trends—statement sleeves, velvet everything, and metallic footwear. Tip: A bell sleeve is a simple way to add immediate drama to a look. It’s a silhouette that will definitely be a holiday gathering go-to for me this season. Extra points for a festive shade! This sweater is from CeCe by Cynthia Steffe, who makes loads of feminine basics fit for the holiday season.
This is my first pair of velvet skinnies (I’ve dabbled in the velvet slip dress and tank department so far) and I’m in love. They are beyond comfortable and make me want to get my dance on!  I feel a bit like “Prince does the holiday” in the absolute best possible way! Edgy, cool, and a little over the top. Head to toe look is from Macy’s. They have everything! It’s a one-stop holiday dressing shop for sure. Fun fact: I live very close to the famous Macy’s Herald Square here in NYC and it has saved me many a days when I decide I have nothing to wear with hours to spare before an event or shoot.
Happy holidays you guys! Let me know what holiday occasions you’ll be dressing up for in the comments. More holiday dressing ideas to come!

Who’s ready for New Year’s Eve! Got your outfit? Touch of bling? Heels that won’t hurt after two hours? And what’s your hair game plan? I’ve been loyal to  Conair’s InfinitiPro curl wand for a while now. My sister turned me onto it and I ordered one immediately after using hers. I use it to achieve the wavy bedhead that I’m usually rocking. So, when Conair asked me to try a new hair tool, their InfinitiPro by Conair Curl Secret 2.0, I was curious to check it out. At first glance, it looked a tad intimidating and not like any hair tool I had used before. But that’s what YouTube is for! I checked out the how-to video and then gave it a whirl.

Soft curls in seconds! Like really, really fast! Like I was using a type writer before and now I’ve got an iPhone X! If you’re someone that curls their hair often, you need this. If you struggle using curl wands and curling irons, you need this. And, if you’re someone who just likes to be in the know about the latest beauty finds, you definitely need this.


Try a center part with all over curls and one side tucked behind the ear. Just add some sparkle on your lobes and you’re ready for the big night! Happy almost New Year love!

Tomorrow is Giving Tuesday, a global day of giving that kicks off the charitable season. We’re all guilty of getting a little preoccupied with our shopping lists this time of year, so it’s nice to have a reminder that the holidays aren’t just about giving gifts, but about giving back. This Giving Tuesday, I’m beyond excited to be an ambassador for the L’eggs Walk Tall initiative to empower women in the workplace in partnership with Dress for Success. I mean, talk about a timely and important cause. We talk about finding your tribe a lot on social media. Dress for Success is the ultimate tribe whose mission is to empower women to achieve economic independence by providing a network of support, workwear, and the toolkit to become girlboss in work and in life.  If you are not familiar with Dress for Success I highly recommend visiting DressForSuccess.org to learn more and get involved with your local affiliate.
As a Walk Tall ambassador, I had the opportunity to style two deserving future boss babes, currently enrolled in the Dress for Success career program, in items from DFS NYC showroom. As women, we get pulled in so many directions and have near impossible expectations to meet.  It can sometimes be tough to Walk Tall through the world, and I believe that our clothes can work as a sort of armor that keeps us feeling empowered all day. I had the loveliest time getting to know Mary and Deniza, hear their journeys, and understand their senses of style. It was important to put them in clothes that not only look great, but make them feel confident. I put the finishing touches on each look with a pair of L’eggs which are perfect when going for a sleek, pulled together work look. They’re also budget friendly!
DFS is always in need of fresh pieces to help stock their showroom from young women with style—that’s where you come in! Next time you’re cleaning out your closet consider donating your gently used workwear, shoes, and accessories to DFS to help give women the confidence to crush it in their careers and lives. What a stylish way to give back, no?
If you’re too in love with your wardrobe to part with any pieces, or you want to do even more to support a fellow boss babe, you can donate here to Dress for Success this Giving Tuesday! A donation of $20 means career counseling sessions that will help her gain the confidence to Walk Tall into a job interview.
Speaking of interviews, keep scrolling for a little interview I did with L’eggs, where I chat about what the Dress For Success mission means to me, my Walk Tall mantra, go-to power pieces you should have in your closet, and more!

L’eggs: What does “walking tall” mean to you?
Me: For me, “walking tall” means living out your passion confidently and bringing your whole mind, body, and individual style to whatever you do. It’s so easy to play it safe and go with the status quo, but if you walk tall, you’re bound to stand out.
L’eggs: Why is Dress for Success an organization worth supporting?
Me: The importance of community among women has been a hot topic recently. Dress for Success has spent two decades bringing like-minded women together to develop the tools and style to pursue the careers of their dreams. If you want to see more women running things in the workplace, DFS is the perfect organization to support. The future is female, after all!
L’eggs: What’s your personal mantra to always remember to walk tall?
Me: I love this quote…”The only person better than you is buried deep inside of you.” It’s my reminder to break out of my comfort zone and leave an impression on the world, because no one else will do it quite like me.
L’eggs: What outfit gives you the most confidence to walk tall?
I like to pair feminine pieces with something more masculine, like a great fitting blazer. Feeling feminine is a source of power for me. And heels, of course. Not sky-high ones, but sturdy ones that make me feel tall and in control, yet grounded.
L’eggs: What are other things that inspire you to walk tall?
Me: My tribe of friends are all boss babes with entrepreneurial mindsets. They inspire me to take risks and own my career and journey.

I’m not big on overly leggy looks, but there’s something about an oversized sweater & mini skirt combo that gets me every time. I popped by Express recently to start stocking up for fall. I found a sea of oversized sweaters in silhouettes ranging from deep v-neck to off-the-shoulder and mini skirts in fall ready textures from leather to velvet. It’s textures like these make the end of warmer days a little less bittersweet. Needless to say, I was a bit in heaven while shopping the racks and will be showing a little more leg until NYC freezes over.
Right now until 11/15, you can stop into any Express store and use my code ‘2004’ to receive $25 off your in-store purchase of $100 or more. Terms and conditions apply.

Bridal Fashion Week was last week here in NYC. As a bride-to-be, it was lovely to see so many dresses up close and to get inspired for my big day. But why wait until then? I’m always on the hunt for delicate, white dresses to pair with black boots and rock with my go-to moto jacket. I love the mix of tough and soft, feminine and edgy. My absolute soft spot is a long sleeve midi like this number. I had the pleasure of attending their insiders bridal fashion week event in partnership with WeddingWire.com and was floored by the number easy, breezy wedding dresses that I could see myself wearing again and again. New Yorkers, or if you’re ever visiting New York City, you must book an appointment at the BHLDN NYC showroom. I loved the romantic and eclectic decor almost as much as the gowns. Definitely insta-worthy!

If you don’t have a go-to black moto yet (or two), stop right now and shop these. It will make transitioning any delicate, summery piece into fall a breeze. I recommend investing in a quality one because it will definitely get it’s fair share of wear, but there are options out there for every budget.

Sister, sister! Sister, sister. I got my own mind…but still seem to dress like my sister all the time. If you got the Sister, Sister reference and sang that last sentence to the tune of the show’s theme song, then here is a digital hug from me to you, friend! Loved that show. But seriously, my sister Jessica (isn’t she just adorbs?) and I have always had similar styles. We never fail to pick out the same exact pieces and find them in each others closets. It’s the craziest thing! So, when LOFT asked us to style up their current collection in honor of National Sister’s Day—they’re celebrating all month long—it was no surprise that we both picked wrap silhouettes + ruffles. I have a handful of ruffle embellished pieces from LOFT and can’t seem to get enough. This cold shoulder chambray top was a welcome addition to the pack. And there’s no doubt that I’ll be borrowing this wrap dress from Jessica very soon. Shop my edit of current favorites from LOFT above including these looks and load more ruffles, of course.

I love this time of year when there’s just a slight chill in the air  it’s not too cold out to showcase the season’s trendy sweaters and fall layered looks sans coat. We refer to it affectionately as sweater weather. LOFT asked me to take things to the next level with two looks that are ALL about sweaters. From tops and cardigans to dresses and skirts LOFT has cozy pieces to keep you in sweaters all fall and winter long. Shop my edit of LOFT sweater silhouettes above.

For Look 1, I paired a colorfully striped sweater with a sweater skirt in equally fun but totally different stripes. I loved that the stripes don’t quite “match” for a look that’s bold and unexpected. Because they are of similar width, it somehow totally works!

For Look 2, I felt like the epitome of fall in a cozy cardigan, sweater dress, and chunky ribbed tights—sweater weather to the next lev.  Shop sweater dress from LOFT below, from blouson sleeves to cold shoulders. I hope you’re inspired to get your sweater weather dressing on. Happy fall!

There’s something about a slouchy blazer and great fitting trouser that makes a girl feel ready to take on the world. Banana Republic sent me a  pair of their popular Sloan pant to style up and I went for a fresh take on suit separates—pairing them with an inverted collar blazer, band tee, and a pair of classic (yet so trendy right now) hoop earrings. The ankle length and mid rise waist make this silhouette cool enough to wear all day and into happy hour. I also can’t wait to pair them with mules and an easy t-shirt for an update to my usual denim weekend look. The olive green color is such a great neutral that I suspect it will go with just about everything, but the options don’t stop there. Shop all the colors & styles right this way.

For Look 1, I paired a colorfully striped sweater with a sweater skirt in equally fun but totally different stripes. I loved that the stripes don’t quite “match” for a look that’s bold and unexpected. Because they are of similar width, it somehow totally works!

For Look 2, I felt like the epitome of fall in a cozy cardigan, sweater dress, and chunky ribbed tights—sweater weather to the next lev.  Shop sweater dress from LOFT below, from blouson sleeves to cold shoulders. I hope you’re inspired to get your sweater weather dressing on. Happy fall!

I’ve been loving experimenting with all kinds of skin care products lately, but there’s just something about a classic. You remember this one. If you’re anything like me, it was the first skin care product you ever coveted. Thinking back, Clinique was one of the first brands I fell in love with. I’ve always been drawn to the pretty pastel packaging, approachable products, overall happy disposition that Clinique radiates. They just know how to make a girl feel effortlessly beautiful. So, imagine my excitement when Clinique reached out to me to do a shoot in studio with the Glamour team! More on that later…

Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+ has the same look you know and love, but now packs double the hydration and environmental protection. It’s perfect for this New Yorker’s dry skin and has become one of my skin care essentials for both day and night use. It’s the only facial lotion I need when traveling (just add SPF), so it’s what I brought this past week to visit my parents back home in Atlanta. How serendipitous that I would do this little at home shoot in my old bedroom where I first fell in love with Clinique!

Now, about the big shoot with Glamour….It was truly one of the funnest experiences I’ve had as a blogger to date. The Glamour crew, glam squad, stylist, and lovely photography team made me feel like a “real” model, but were also super patient with my lazy eyes (you have no idea of the number of half-asleep images I’ve amassed over years of blogging) and gave me plenty of room to goof around. Here’s the Glamour spread from this month’s issue (pinch me, I’m in print!) and a few behind-the-scenes snaps from set with Cyndi & Thania. Both these ladies rock, so definitely check them out, and check out Clinique’s must-have moisturizer right here.

If you haven’t checked out that post, I told the Anthropologie NYC team what I was into and they styled me up perfectly! I’m all about this statement sleeve moment for a twist on the many off the shoulder tops already in my closet — cause how many is too many, really?

I’d like you to officially meet Shola. You might have noticed him sparingly in an Instagram Story or a Valentine’s Day post. A devoted Instagram Husband, he’s dedicated many a weekend or vacation day to getting the perfect shot. When Fossil asked me to try out their new hybrid smartwatch, I immediately new I had to ask if Shola could try one out too. He’s very into smart watches & classic ones as well. It’s always tough for him to decide which look to go for so this watch is the best of both worlds for him! He purchased his first Fossil watch in 9th grade. It was THE cool kids watch for him back in high school, so the nostalgia is real.

This is my first Fossil watch AND first smartwatch! Shola has been trying to get me to wear a smartwatch for a few years now. He’s always raving about how functional they are, but I never liked the look of them. Now, I’m getting very into all the tech-y aspects of this one that helps me get through my day and I’m happy that the classic style goes with everything! 

I’m not a fan of having my phone out when I’m in meetings or at dinner, as I like to be present and reserve that time for the special people that I’m with. To be notified of important messages and notifications—all from my wrist—is a game changer! The hands move, along with a gentle buzz, to let you know when you’ve received a call, text, email or app notification. Shola is super excited that I won’t miss as many of his text messages—he’s set to #1 on my watch. I love finding real heritage brands that continue to reinvent themselves. It feels good to wear something classic and quality that you know will stand the test of time. Pun intended 😉

My days are often lengthy—filled with early morning photoshoots, full days at the office, a yoga or barre class, and creative meetings over cocktails. Since we New Yorkers don’t have cars, I have to bring everything I need when I leave the house in the morning, This roomy tote fits all I need for my full day. What I love most are the handles along the front of the bag that are perfect for securing a yoga mat or jacket. With all the space this bag wondrously has—I’m talking room for a laptop, change of clothes, shoes, and all the normal purse things—my belongings for the day are secured in one bag, making it easy to grab and go without a ton of coordination. It’s kind of a girlboss must have! Speaking of secure, Pacsafe’s whole Citysafe CX Collection are thoughtful bags that keep your belongings safe with discrete features like built-in locking zippers and slashgaurd strap. This means your bag does the work to deter pick pockets and prevent theft while you’re busy living out your fabulous city lifestyle!

I had so much fun hosting LOFT’s first 97 Days of Summer in-store event this past Friday in NYC. I was all ruffles and smiles in a one shoulder blouse and wrap skirt. If this top looks familiar, it’s because I wore it in another color in this recent post. It was so good, I had to get another! I highly recommend this wrap skirt to add to your summer shopping list. It’s a versatile piece that I see wearing to work, parties, or even as a cover up on vacation with a simple black swimsuit. You can shop my edit above of current LOFT favorites for a summer well-dressed. LOFT will be celebrating Summer Fridays in stores all summer long so be sure to look out for a party in your city!

I find that women are often intimidated by black-tie weddings. The thought of a dressy, floor-length gown means that you must get all dolled up and spend a fortune. When it comes to formal weddings, I prefer to keep things understated—a slinky dress, lived in hair, and minimal accessories. I love how the cutouts in this gown from David’s Bridal give it a designer look and are sexy without being overtly so. No high slits or cleavage necessary, so you won’t upstage the bride. I also love the color. It’s a very summer appropriate shade of berry, however, deep enough to work for formal events all year. It’s an ideal staple dress that I plan to pull out again and again. For more wedding wardrobe ideas, I love this guide that breaks down what to wear for every wedding, from casual to destination.

Upon meeting me, I’ll likely ask you a barrage of personal questions right away. It’s not because I’m nosy. It’s because I want to get to the good stuff. Small talk isn’t really my thing. I want to know what you’re passionate about. I want to know your insides. 
I love having thoughtful, open, heartfelt discussion with like-minded women. Thanks to The Refined Woman and Anthropologie, I had the pleasure of sharing a gorgeous meal (and several bottles of bubbly) with a handful of creative and vibrant women on the cutest of rooftops in Harlem. From the food to the flowers to the new found friendships, it was an evening worth cherishing. We spoke candidly about finding balance, finding friendships, and finding headspace in this crazy city. We got real and I walked away with some new additions to my tribe that I can’t wait to get to know better, collaborate with, and support in all they do. You know that  saying…you can’t pick your family, but you can pick your friends. I firmly believe that a woman’s tribe of friends is essential to her fulfillment and success, so choose wisely. I love this quote from Amy Poehler on building her tribe…
“Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you, spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life.”

My love for muumuus continues. This time in a shorter format. This dress is on major sale so definitely snag it, but the backpack is the real story. The perfect size for all-day jaunts around the city, the slightly petite size holds everything you actually need. I’m loving the pastel shades that have been popping up this season. The light blue of this bag is just right—not too girly. This bag will be seeing many an adventure this summer. Firs stop, Shake Shack.

So, you’ve heard of the little black dress and are well versed on its versatility and necessity to your wardrobe. Well the little black one piece is key to a simple and effortless summer. It’s fit for every swimsuit-worthy occasion, can go sexy or conservative, and even double as a body suit worn with cut-off shorts or maxi skirts. The plunging neckline on this one from Lands’ End shows just enough skin to keep things interesting. What’s really great about it though, is the smocked texture—such a sweet detail. I’m also into this one for when you plan to be active or you’re just feeling sporty and this one for lounging by the pool.

First thing’s first—NYCers, I’ll be at LOFT in Flatiron (156 5th Ave) this Friday from 3-5pm for a little Summer Friday fun! There will be sips, snacks, a giveaway, and a very cute gift with purchase tote bag. Leave work early, come hang out,  and let me style you! Now about this look…I’m positively smitten with this chambray ruffle one shoulder. You definitely need this. I’m loving it paired with denim for a summertime take on the Canadian tuxedo. LOFT made a version in white as well, in addition to a few sleeveless options that are equally adorable. All linked above! I’m partial to cropped denim year round for it’s ability to show off ankle boots and ankle strap sandals alike. The kick crop silhouette of these with its slight flare at the hem is especially cute and the wash is my ideal shade of blue for a warm weather wardrobe. I’ve also been topping every look off with gold hoop earrings lately so have been buying them up in different variations. They’re somehow just the right amount of classic, trendy, and bold all at once. Hmm, I just realized that’s the look I’m basically always going for!

My absolute favorite staple for summer is a printed or embroidered bohemian blouse. It’s my go-to way to look effortless, cool, and feminine when the summer heat hits. Let’s just say I have A LOT of them. This look was just right for a carrot juice powered Sunday catching up on work and treating myself to a little window shopping, but I’d just as easily pair the top with strappy block heels for date night with my guy. It will definitely be packed for Memorial Day weekend coming up, where I’ll wear it to dress up my distressed cut off shorts for daytime gatherings near the beach with friends. I could go on because these tops are right for just about every occassion! I’ve partnered with LOFT to feature a few of its collections, but this has to be my favorite thus far. You can get you’re entire haul of bohemian tops for the summer season in one shot with my edit above. And while you’re at it, pair your new treasures with some of the pieces below. I especially love the wrap skirt to take along on vacation this summer. Happy shopping!

How cute are these slides! I love a fun pop of color, but it doesn’t always feel right during colder months, especially here in NYC. It’s such a treat for me to slide on a color like bright yellow once summer starts.

The only thing that makes collaborating with brands more fun is getting to collaborate with other bloggers babes too! Meeting other like-minded, creative, entrepreneurial women is truly my favorite perk of being an “influencer” of sorts. I love our little community of creative types. And in the spirit of community, new friends, and down right girl power, I met up with Kat, Krystal, Esther, and Brynn to model a few of our favorite dresses from BHLDN’s latest delivery. The dresses were a dream—perfect for the impending wedding season or the various spring events you might have on your calendar. Between shots, I peppered in questions to the girls about their backgrounds and what they’re up to outside of blogging and taking pics for the gram. It’s our diversity of career paths, current passions, and goals that I find refreshing and oh so inspiring. Chatting it up with other equally ambitious women is probably my favorite pastime, followed by cheering them on!

If you’ve been visiting my little corner of the internet for a while, then you might be surprised to see me in a short skirt. I NEVER where them. I’m much more comfortable in maxi skirts and dresses or down right muumuus. But the corduroy mini skirt is making a comeback, and since I’m partial to many things seventies inspired, I finally slipped one on in a French Connection fitting room. Paired with an oversized knit, classic stripes, and thigh high suede boots, this look feels very Brady Bunch meets Chloe to me, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Extra points if the skirt buttons down for that extra hint of nostalgia.

Whether you’re an NYC local or visiting for the first time, here are three little spots you’ll want to check out. Also check out Vince Camuto‘s spring collection. It’s packed with go-tos like this bomber jacket in essential military green (bombers are kind of the new leather jacket!), espadrille sneakers (for the girl who already has a pair of classic white kicks), and an edgy backpack that’s just the right size for all day exploring.
The healthy Italian fare is quite good at this hole in the wall found down one of NoLIta quiet blocks, but priorities, you’ll be going to Pietro Nolita for the photo op! I’m pleased to report that the inside is just as pink and photo-worthy as the outside. I don’t claim to be a foodie, but I’m a cocktail snob for sure. My reco—the Nolitarita. I’m a sucker for anything with Mezcal right now.

Pietro Nolita is located at 174 Elizabeth Street, New York, NY 10012

Channel your inner gallerina at Milk Gallery. While the rest of the Meatpacking District teems with tourists, this cool kids gallery—showcasing works from known and emerging artists and photographers—is tucked away in plain sight. Exhibitions rotate throughout the year except for February and September when the space is taken over by NYFW.

Milk Studios is located at 450 W 15th St # 800, New York, NY 10011

Part coffee shop, part nail salon, part massage spot, Chillhouse is a serene little escape from the gritty Lower East Side. Go with your girls for a coffee date and new nail lewk or create a sweet desk space in the white-washed cafe, then treat yourself to a massage after all your hard work. The beet-chata is a must try for the unique taste and the Insta photo!

Now that it’s officially spring, I’m officially really into florals. This jumpsuit is fabulous paired with light layers now while the weather is still chilly here in NYC. Come warmer days and into summer I’ll rock it solo with a strappy block heeled sandal. LOFT has so many pretty floral prints right now and in a range of silhouettes—shop my edit above! I’m especially keen on this off the shoulder top and drop waist dress. While I love a good floral, the trick is to edge up the print with leather, high waisted denim, or funky heels to give the otherwise feminine piece a little cool factor. Happy spring!

Chinos are such a classic piece, but I hadn’t really every tried incorporating them into my wardrobe. When Anthropologie asked me to style a pair, I had my reservations. But after a few minutes playing in my closet, I quickly realized that the relaxed fit of this pair is very much aligned with my personal style. I went about pairing them with twists on other classic pieces, like a striped shirt updated with a bell sleeve and a jacket that’s taken on a kimono-like silhouette—don’t you just die over the details on this kimono jacket, though? I rode the wave of my already eclectic choices with a pair of statement earring. They’re leather! Once I went that far, how else could I top off the look than with a leopard print bootie? Am I right? Heels, of course, to balance out the boyish fit of the chino. This look was definitely a lesson in pairing unexpected pieces, and I hope it inspires you to mix two (or three, or four!) pieces that you might not have thought to pair before. Extra points for prints and embellishment. Have fun!

The only thing that makes collaborating with brands more fun is getting to collaborate with other bloggers babes too! Meeting other like-minded, creative, entrepreneurial women is truly my favorite perk of being an “influencer” of sorts. I love our little community of creative types. And in the spirit of community, new friends, and down right girl power, I met up with Kat, Krystal, Esther, and Brynn to model a few of our favorite dresses from BHLDN’s latest delivery. The dresses were a dream—perfect for the impending wedding season or the various spring events you might have on your calendar. Between shots, I peppered in questions to the girls about their backgrounds and what they’re up to outside of blogging and taking pics for the gram. It’s our diversity of career paths, current passions, and goals that I find refreshing and oh so inspiring. Chatting it up with other equally ambitious women is probably my favorite pastime, followed by cheering them on!

You can follow the girls on Instagram at these handles: @therefinedwoman, @krystal_bick, @estherhouston, and @brynnelliottwatkins

P.S. I want to post more on these jeans soon, but take my word for it. They’ll be your new go-to pair!

Florals are an obvious choice for spring, but I love introducing them during colder months in moody palettes grounded in black, emerald, and deep plum. LOFT‘s collection of dark florals is the perfect remedy for an otherwise gloomy winter day, so good that I couldn’t pick just one print! I asked my sister to help model a few of my favorites. You can shop my full LOFT dark floral edit above. When styling floral prints, pair patterns of a different scale together for a little pattern play, or pair them with high waste denim for a laid back nod to the seventies.

I’ve recently acquired a few long black gowns and have found that they’re as useful as a classic little black dress during the holiday party season. I love this White House Black Market version of the little black gown—let’s call it the LBG—for it’s of the moment cold shoulder detail and touch of sparkle. The easy fabric feels almost as good as pjs. While I don’t have plans yet for New Year’s Eve, I suspect this gown will work for blow out party and cocktails parties alike. Shop White House Black Market’s party dress collection just in time for New Year’s Eve right here.

New Year’s Eve is synonymous with short sequin dresses, but this year the cold NYC weather has me wanting to sport something on the cozier side. For a look that’s equal parts festive and warm try pairing a party sweater and a little ear bling. What’s a party sweater you ask? It’s any sweater that has that extra element of sparkle or special detail. Extra points if it shimmers. I found a few from LOFT that foot the bill. The one I’m rocking is particularly soft and has a subtle silver threading running throughout. You could also go for one with sequin embellishment or maybe even a sexy, off-the-shoulder silhouette. Whatever you wear, I hope you have a lovely New Year’s Eve and a Happy New Year!

I’m a big fan of maxis and jumpsuits for their throw it on an go nature. It’s one piece that always looks like way more effort was involved. So when co-ord sets came on the scene I welcomed a trend that was just as brainless, but earn you even more brownie points from outfit admirers. This printed co-ord set was the first thing I packed in my bag for my trip to Hawaii and it ended up working triple duty for me. I wore the pieces together as seen here for an evening out. I then paired the skirt with a flowy white top for a luau situation and later wore the crop top with cut off shorts to check out some local shops during the day. Oh and yes, I’m wearing just one earring. Full disclosure: when packing for this photo shoot the second earring didn’t make it into my bag, but what a happy mistake, right? I loved the one duster earring look with my hair pulled to one side and have rocked it a few more times since then!

Sun’s out, nips out!  I shot this look while on a quick work trip to LA. More on that later. For now, I want to tell you about a new app I’m into where I scored this top and kicks…

I get approached by fashion app developers a lot, and find it tough to see the value add from one app to the next. But I just discovered one that I can get behind. It’s called LUV.IT and it gives you a 2.5% referral fee for purchases your followers make on items you’ve LUV’d or shared. That means you’ll finally get paid for being the designated stylist of your girl squad. You also get a little cash back in your pocket on purchases you make for yourself. Plus, the app is clean and pretty, which is always a bonus in my book. The app will be live in a few weeks but you can join the waitlist to get early access here. Oh and be sure to follow me on the app @waityouneedthis for my picks. I’ll be updating them weekly. Happy shopping!

I shot this look last month on my way to the Lou & Grey store opening here in NYC. I’m just getting around to posting it, but it’s crazy that it’s still somehow relevant in mid October. It’s been an unseasonably warm 80 degrees the past two days and I’ve taken full advantage by getting a last wear out of my summer favorites. I’m equally excited to through an oversized sweater over this same look to take me well into fall.
Tip: A wide brim hat and low cut ankle boots—both in a soft neutral shade—work in warmer weather, while helping summer pieces look more fall appropriate. Make them your transitional dressing staples.

I loved it almost as much as I loved my daily dose of the shaved ice you’ll find for sale along the roadside all over Maui. But back to this bikini…it somehow perfectly sporty and sexy at once. Note the high neck meets super subtle under boob cleavage. Plus, the cheeky bottom will have you blending in just fine with the local surfer girls. I’m happy to report that the top is over 50% off right here in all sizes. It ran pretty small in my experience so plan to go up a size or two.

I live with my boyfriend, so looking cute (and just a little bit sexy) around the house on weekends is something I strive for. One combo I’m currently loving is a cropped sweater atop a satin slip. It’s ideal for these fall days when there’s just starting to be a morning chill in the air. I play it cool by simply tossing a cropped sweater, like this snuggly boucle pick from Aerie, over a slip style nightie I slept in the night before. Add a pair of equally comfy socks and your casual/sexy around the house look is complete.

Happy Friday! There’s nothing better than leaving work early on Summer Fridays in NYC. I like to spend mine hitting a few Soho shops, then finding friends to meet for a daytime cocktail. Cocktails usually turns into dinner, followed by more cocktails so I always try to wear something that transitions well. That’s where a great LBJ comes in. This one is on sale! Start with kicks, but throw a pair of heels in your bag and you’re ready to go from sunlit days to endless Friday nights.

Finally sharing my graduation look! I wore this tea length cocktail dress for my graduation from business school back in May. Maxis are usually my go-to for daytime celebrations, however since I had to wear a graduation gown over my look for much of the day, I opted for a dress with a similar hemline. This cocktail dress did the trick! I have to say that it fit like a glove—no all day pulling and tugging like with many strapless dresses. Plus, the exposed zipper and sheer tulle hem added the ideal dose of edge to keep the look from feeling to precious.
  
 Special thanks to my love who I could not have made it through bschool without. We did it! Also how cute is his look?

It’s been pretty hot here in NYC lately and something backless is like automatic AC. This backless bodysuit has been on major repeat during brutally warm summer days—so much so that I went back for one in stripes, too! I love it with all things high waisted, like these denim culottes. And as you may know, I’m always on the hunt for a great daytime heel, and I just found a new go-to in these mules with a strut-in-them-all-day chunky heel.

Start with kicks, but throw a pair of heels in your bag and you’re ready to go from sunlit days to endless Friday nights.

The classic LBD isn’t just for cocktails and nights on the town. This loose fitting, causal option is my go-to for low key days running errands around the city.

I love playing with proportion and finding simple pieces with interesting silhouettes. This top had me at hello…sleeves. As in, you can’t take your eyes off them, right? The volume and embroidery give this top a truly unique feel and the deep mustard yellow is a perfect gateway color to ease into more vibrant, summery hues. As if the sleeve moment wasn’t enough, this top actually buttons all the way down and becomes the coolest jacket-like layer that I can’t wait to style over a floaty, white dress. I wore this look for an always photo-worthy trip to one of the many fruit stands along the roadside in Maui. I’ve never had coconuts more full of the sweetest coconut water than here in Hawaii.

Finally sharing my graduation look! I wore this tea length cocktail dress for my graduation from business school back in May. Maxis are usually my go-to for daytime celebrations, however since I had to wear a graduation gown over my look for much of the day, I opted for a dress with a similar hemline. This cocktail dress did the trick! I have to say that it fit like a glove—no all day pulling and tugging like with many strapless dresses. Plus, the exposed zipper and sheer tulle hem added the ideal dose of edge to keep the look from feeling to precious.
  
 Special thanks to my love who I could not have made it through bschool without. We did it! Also how cute is his look?

Orange you glad its summer? Add a lace up top in a bright white hue to your rotation. It’s the perfect paring to all the prints you’ll be craving this time of year. I wore this outfit for a day of shopping on Front Street in the cute little town of Lahania, Hawaii. And sure, the lace up look is sexy, but the extra ventilation was the real added bonus for those hot Hawaii days.

Get an oversized denim jacket, okay? You just need it. Once that’s checked of your list, the magic begins because this baby pairs well with literally everything, which I’m sure I’ll be demonstrating here in many a post. An oversized denim jacket basically replaces my go-to black leather moto once the weather heats up. I mean, light wash denim is legit the new black come spring, am I right? I’ve paired mine here with a wide leg jean for an overall oversized take on the Canadian tuxedo. Coupled with white accents, its cool girl chic for spring.

Plus, I’m excited to be one of Ditto.com‘s latest brand ambassadors and bring you a special offer just in time for the warmer weather. So what’s Ditto.com? They’ve got hundreds of designer frames that they’d like to rent out to you! Here’s the deal: use code WAITYOUNEEDTHIS on Ditto.com when you sign up and you’ll get a month of unlimited designer sunnies, like this Elizabeth and James pair, for free! With no obligation to a pay a dime! If you like the service, you can stay on for just $24 a month. I’m on my third pair this month and loving it.

A perfectly pulled together look is great, however I’m currently into stocking up on accessories that I can reach for again and again. This homburg is my current go-to add-on for simple outfits (and bad hair days). The camel color and classic style seem to complement and elevate just about any look I put together these days so apologies in advance if I go overboard. The bucket bag is my weekend staple. Sizable enough to house all my must-haves for a full day of exploring, yet petite enough to throw on crossbody style on one of those NYC nights that starts with a dinner reservation but that you know has endless possibilities.

As you might know, I’ve been busy earning an MBA at NYU Stern for the past two years. Well, I did it! I’ll be graduating this Friday and of course, I’ll need the perfect outfit for the big day. So I was ecstatic when Barneys New York invited me to come shopping and find a killer grad-day look. I chose a gorgeous Prabal Gurung dress that was equal parts flouncy and fitted for a bohemian, yet pulled together feel—my ideal vibe for basically every look. Click over to The Window to see the full story.
Plus, to celebrate the class of 2016, during the month of May, all graduates who spend $250 in store at Barneys New York will receive $25 to be redeemed in June!

I’ve been pretty into skincare lately and have been adding a new products to my daily cleansing routine. After a few months of testing, the results are in and I wanted to share my thoughts with you on a few favorites.

I have fairly dry skin, so when I’m in need of some intense hydration, I apply Glossier’s Moisturizing Moon Mask. It gives my face that “ahhhhh” feeling. After 20 minutes my skin is plumper, less tight, and extra hydrated. I’ve also been using the Mega Greens Galaxy Pack. Glossier calls it a juice cleanse for your face and I agree. It’s a kind a clay mask that detoxifies and draws out oils. Because my skin is on the dryer side, I’ve been using it sparingly when I feel like I need an extra refresh or I feel a blemish coming on. Glossier’s Priming Moisturizer is a real favorite. It’s light, yet creamy and just feels like it works. Plus, its the perfect size to toss in my carry on for all my jetset moments.

I have dark under eye circles that can make me look tired even when I’m not. Chanel’s Sublimage La Creme Yeux Ultimate Regeneration Eye Cream gives a bit of life to my under eyes. The effect is subtle, but instant and anti-aging ingredients are killer.

BOSCIA Balancing Facial Tonic is my morning thirst quencher. I love to spritz it on my face and neck right after I hop out of the shower. It’s meant to banish impurities that you might miss when cleansing and give an extra step in preventing dehydration, but I mostly just love the luxurious feeling of misting it on each morning.

Peet Rivko is a very cool skincare line that a friend of mine from business school and her facialist are launching this summer. They swear by this balancing face oil, and now so do I. I apply just a few drops on my finger tips and then tap them across my face. I follow it up by gently rubbing in a moisturizer which ensures the oil also gets spread evenly on my skin.

ORIGINS Make A Difference Plus + Rejuvenating Treatment is another moisturizer that I’m loving to apply day and night when I’m not using the one from Glossier. The texture has a cooling gel effect that feels oh so good on my tired face in the morning and equally soothes my skin before sleep. The Drink Up Intensive Overnight Mask from Origins is also a favorite. First of all, it smells AMAZING. My boyfriend can’t help but comment each time I wear it to bed that I smell like mangos, and then scoot a bit closer to me. I also love that the mask is transparent and there’s nothing to peel off. Just let your skin soak it up through the night and rinse your face in the morning.

Wide legged and hardware free, these dungarees are the adult version of the overalls you once loved. Since it was still a bit breezy last weekend here in NYC, I played the layer game with a light sweater and turtleneck. I’d never thought of layering underneath overalls before but the subtle pop of stripes makes the whole look so much more interesting, don’t you think? Layering aside, the low back silhouette has me dreaming of pairing these dungarees with a flowy little crop top come summer. Stay tuned.

This morning as I was scrolling through the countless Happy Earth Day notes and images on Insta and planning what cute image I’d post, I had a thought. Wait, what am I actually doing to celebrate Earth Day? To make an impact? So I decided to make a resolution. Like New Years but planet-specific, and one that I can actually commit to. I’m hoping that it’s a tradition I can continue each Earth Day, and one that you’ll think about joining in on too.  Now, I’m no tree hunger, but I’m finding that a little bit goes a long way in making my footprint a smaller one.
Here are a few resolutions I hope to make stick:

Buy organic basics — Non-organic cotton is the second most chemically sprayed crop out there. A simple cotton t-shirt, for example, takes a third of a pound of synthetic fertilizers to make. Yikes.
Cut back on red meat — I’m by no means a huge red meat eater but learning that it takes around 840 gallons of fresh water to produce 1 serving of red meat makes me want to switch over to turkey burgers for good.
Carry a reusable water bottle, always — Because recycling is tough on the go and this one is such a no brainer! I’m eyeing this leak-proof bottle that I can throw in my everyday tote with no worries.
 
To Mamma Earth, Happy Earth Day!

To my surprise, one of my favorite experiences while in Cambodia was a cooking class along the Siem Reap countryside. Like most days while in Cambodia, I awoke bright and early, this time to make my way to the market where I would learn about each of the ingredients that would go into the food I’d be preparing later that afternoon.

After finishing up at the market, my group headed to an outdoor kitchen tucked away in the countryside of Siem Reap. There we spent hours preparing spring rolls, amok (a traditional Cambodian cuisine) and a to-die-for pumpkin custard under the supervision of the warmest and most seasoned chefs one could hope to learn from. Between the vibrant market, beautiful countryside landscape, kind instructors, and beyond flavorful foods, it was an authentic and memorable experience that my heart (and stomach) craves to have again.

Keep scrolling for a very simple recipe for this glorious pumpkin custard!

While in South East Asia, I traveled to Phuket in search of limestone cliffs and sea green lagoons. It was a magical few days of sun bathing on boats, snorkeling off shore, and soaking up quality time with friends.Laughter is great medicine, but laughter with a best friend in a far of land equals 100% no care.

I recently did some country hopping around Southeast Asia. It was the furthest I’d ever been from home and vastly different from cultures I’d experienced before. Of all the cities I visited, Cambodia stole my heart. Our first stop upon arriving was a visit to the ancient temples surrounding Siem Reap. I set out for the temples at 4am before the sun came up to see the sunrise over the grandest temple, Angkor Wat, then spent the day wandering through these vast works of art. I was captivated by the intricacy of design and history behind each detail. If you’re not a design enthusiast, the sheer grandeur of each structure will draw you in. For a day of temple wandering, I opted for a breezy jumpsuit reminiscent of traditional Cambodian wear and perfect for climbing the many, many temple stairs. My go-to J.Crew Panama hat guarded my face from the day’s sun rays and a large suede shoulder bag comfortably fit my Canon 6D,  a scarf to cover my shoulders in modesty while inside the temple walls, and any trinkets I picked up at neighboring street markets along the way.

What words can I use describe the many temples of Bangkok? Grand, colorful, beyond opulent, simply magnificent. During my South East Asia travels, I spent a full day taking in the Bangkok temple scene
and soaked up every last drop of opulence and history I could manage. My favorite, Wat Suthat, is pictured here. Not nearly the grandest of the temples, its white washed walls, mosaic touches, countless airy archways, and gilded accents were a welcome dose of decor inspiration. It was also less crowded than the more over the top neighboring temples—ideal for quiet reflection, endless daydreaming, and of course, a photo shoot.

Can we get intimate for a sec? Step into my bedroom and meet LIVELY, a spankin new line of bras, bralettes, and undies that just launched today! Created with stylish, outgoing, and active gals like you and me in mind, LIVELY has designed a collection of stylish/comfy, sporty/feminine underthings that it’s calling Leisurée. Lively approached me to join its crew of badass brand ambassadors and the offer could not have come at a better time! Between you and me, my lingerie drawer was in desperate need of an overhaul and these pretty pieces are just what I needed to step up my underwear game. I’m happy to report that all bras are currently at the affordable price of $35. Plus, you can brainlessly earn points with each purchase or by referring friends to put toward dollar bills for your next LIVELY purchase. How badass is that? Going to go put some clothes on now…happy shopping!

Maxi dresses are possibly my favorite silhouette for their level of comfort alone. They’re easiest to come by during spring/summer, so I was excited to find this loose sweater dress style before the season turned. Paired with an equally cozy maxi sweater, I plan to get lots of wear out of this look during the chilly, yet sun sucked weekends ahead.

Spring is just around the corner here in NYC and a sleeveless coat is one of my trusty pieces for transitioning from one season to the next. It’s also a fun opportunity to play with proportions. I happen to think a long vest plays so well with cropped denim. Another great transitional piece—the turtleneck. It’s the perfect light layer to shield me from the wind in lieu of the bulky scarves I’ve been wearing the last few months. Another tip, switch the boots for pumps and you’ve got a drop dead chic business casual ensemble.

That’s how good it is.Oversized and a little sexy, it’s the perfect spring/summer dress for brunch, meetings, or window shopping. Plus, the sleeves make it more office appropriate than your current go-to maxi. Accessorize with espadrille sandals, round sunnies, thin bangles, and a bucket bag. It also works well with strappy stacked heels for a slightly more dressed up look.

The weather in NYC has been especially schizophrenic lately, so getting dressed for the elements can be complicated. Coat? Jacket? Layers? And you know that thing when it’s warm on the sunny side of the street and cold on the shady side? For a day of shopping for plants for my apartment, I opted to layer this printed blanket cardigan (on sale!) over a leather jacket. The effect was a transitional look that was a pleasant change from the winter coats I’ve been rocking for months, and it still had the right amount of warmth for a 57 degrees in February kind of day. In lieu of my usually snood scarf, I tied a bandana around my neck for just the added amount of coverage from the subtle chill still in the air.

I’m always on the hunt for a solid staple leather jacket and this one definitely makes the cut. First off, the price is right at $550. Now, I know that may sound steep to some, but I’ve done the leg work and I can confidently tell you that this jacket is a steal. You’ll be hard pressed to find one as buttery soft, flattering, and comfortable—it feels perfectly worn in on the first wear! Not to mention the color is the richest of navy blues. I’ll be keeping this beauty on heavy rotation for spring paired with t-shirts and denim or over a floaty dress.

I love the idea of a colored interior door to change the vibe of a room. Try one of the tips below for an easy space update that’s as easy as the swipe of a paint brush.

Go for incognito doors and paint them the same color as your walls, like in this moody all grey abode.

Play with different hues within the same color family for a sophisticated feel.

Rich colors make a serious impact against white walls and are a happy medium when you can’t commit to all over wall color.

Try yellow doors to add immediate cheer to a room.

Juxtapose more traditional wallpaper with a statement making citron door.

Can’t decide on a color? Try two!

I’m all about layering simple pieces lately, like this workwear button up and breezy dress.  I sported the dress a alone for brunch with friends and then tied a button up over top for window shopping once the cool late afternoon air hit. Just like that, a dress becomes a skirt. Plus, a button up is much more light weight than lugging a jacket around, no? Opt for clean accessories in neutral tones like this circle cross body bag and wedge espadrilles to keep the look feeling light.

I traveled to Stockholm about two weeks ago for a little work and a little play. I wore this look for a day of exploring and shopping on my day off. I spotted this vintage backpack in the cutest little second hand store and couldn’t believe it was a mere $100! I had to wear it immediately. Stay tuned for my next post from Stockholm for a little city guide of the sweetest shops I discovered during my trip.

I’m a little obsessed with this alternative to traditional prints or paintings to adorn our walls. Textured, homespun, and sometimes reminiscent of a far off land, fiber wall hangings add the eclectic touch that we so love to see in home decor.

The highlight of our stay in Dubai was a trip into the desert for camel photo ops, four wheeler rides, and lots of belly dancing. It was also the perfect backdrop for a killer shoot. So what does one wear on a desert safari? Roomy pants are equally ideal for riding camels and billowing in the warm, desert wind. An off the shoulder top and lots of silver bangles add a touch of bohemian glamour.

Leather leggings, faux fur, and a chic sweater. All in black of course. It’s a recipe for a winter ensemble with understated edge. The bohemian vibe of tree branch crawler earrings and feather lariat necklace are the perfect juxtaposition to this strong monochrome look, while the dark encrusted cyrstals give a subtle metallic touch.

When it comes to hanging the perfect gallery wall, pretty much anything goes.  With all the fabulous options to organize (or disorganize!) a gallery wall, here’s a few tips to help you find your gallery wall personality.
 
Neat freak?  Declutter your gallery wall with clean lines, consistent spacing, and coordinating frames.

Love mixing traditional and modern? Marry your contemporary space with a gallery wall of old world art.

Craving a WOW factor? Grow your gallery from the ground up, covering the entire wall from top to bottom.

Think outside the grid. Position pieces at different angles to and extra interest to your wall.

Fashion is art too! Add glamour to a wall with a gown, caftan, or vintage gem.

Luxe knits, easy denim, delicate lace, and fringe detail are just a few of the trends from H&M‘s fall collection helping to pacify my feelings about summer’s end. My sister and I stepped out in this duster sweater and unstructured jacket, and took the collection for a test drive. Wear these transitional pieces now over summer frocks and later in between winter layers. When you have pieces like these to pile on, bring on the crisp, fall breeze.

While I love experimenting with trends, new silhouettes, and statement pieces, there’s nothing like throwing on a few of my go-to basics for a look that’s totally me. So when StyleList asked me to put together a look that emulates my style, I knew just where to start. Boyfriend jeans are a staple in my wardrobe. I count on them to bring a cool-girl vibe to any outfit. A billowy peasant top adds a breezy, bohemian feel. I like to let it fall off my shoulder for a touch of sex appeal. Paired with a wide-brim wool hat and classic black ankle boots, it’s an easy, urban look that’s perfect for exploring the streets of New York City.

Midway through my stay in Barcelona, I took a day trip to Tossa de Mar. It was the perfect getaway from the bustling city streets—and just an hour away by bus. I spent the day frequenting the colorful beachfront restaurants and quaint neighborhood shops tucked away in the winding stone streets. And of course did some sunbathing.

I’m a sucker for pretty much any maxi dress, but this one was special. The plunging neckline, drop waist, and billowy sleeves made for a drop dead gorgeous combination. I topped the look off with a few fish pendants and a little sparkle for a major moment of bohemian glamour. Perfect for an early dinner by the waves.
