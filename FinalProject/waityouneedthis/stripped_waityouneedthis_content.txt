Last week I had the opportunity to attend Atlanta Apparel  an apparel trade show held in Atlanta You may have caught the fun over on my IG stories If youve never been to a trade show  its basically a space for brands whether established or new to meet and share next seasons trends with retail buyers I used to attend shows seasonally back when I was an assistant buyer for Bloomingdales It was so much fun to get away from my desk and check out whats coming down the pike for next season  discover new designers  and connect with the brands Atlanta Apparel hosts contemporary  young contemporary  ready to wear  accessories and more Theres even a runway show In case you missed it  heres a recap of some of the brands and trends I discovered while exploring the markets 14 floors of fashion


I saw loads of sequins and metallic pieces throughout the day Definitely add this trend to your shopping list


If you know me  you know Im all about a flowy midi or maxi moment So glad to see this trend around the market I love this more polished take

There was a Miami based showroom that focused on Spanish designers I was dying over the dress below by Lulu Cant wait for it to come out this spring
 
Florals for spring are always in style

New dress brand One Pretty Time  OPT  is launching this spring Think feminine frocks in mini  midi  and maxi lengths and from prints to pleats to sequins Below is a sneak peek

 If you are a shop owner or looking to grow your clothing or accessories brand  you must look into attending the next market

On August 4th in Palmetto Bluff  South Carolina  Shola and I tied the knot and teamed up with BRIDES to do it You may have been following along when I announced that we would be this years couple for BRIDES Live Wedding and when I updated you on how planning was going Id like to extend a sincere thank you to all who voted for our wedding day details  from my dress to the decor to what we would do on our honeymoonmore on that coming soon Now Im sharing our big day and how everything turned out Keep reading to see how our wedding came to life


The winning dress was a romantic ballgown The gown felt glamorous and very bridal  but was also quite clean and simple with a cascading ruffle detail

You know I had to have a second dress I went for a more form fitting  strapless gown with a modern take on lace
Dress  Ellington by Maggie Sottero

I had a very small wedding party  just my sister as my maid of honor She and my mom helped me get dressed in the cute bridal cottage

We chose to have a first look so there would be plenty of time for photos We met in a secluded path framed with rows of Spanish moss filled trees The oh so romantic Spanish moss was what made me fall in love with this venue




After our first look  we explored the resorts 20 000 acres with the BRIDES team and took portraits all over the grounds The BRIDES team asked me if I was comfortable hopping on this swing in heels Umm  yeah I was



And of course we had to have a little bohemian bridal moment Enter area rugs and pillow a plenty


Just out here being a blushing bride


Our wedding venue was the stunning Montage Palmetto Bluff resort The ceremony took place in the most intimate chapel where the benches were made from reclaimed wood from 911  We were honored to have this piece of New York City play a part in our wedding day


Greenery was our winning BRIDES Live Wedding decor concept The BRIDES team was inspired by the southern tropical vibes of  South Carolina and brought that inspiration into all of the florals with an eclectic mix of crawling palms and white blooms I walked down the aisle to At Last by Etta James and our family members read an excerpt from The Alchemist  one of Sholas favorite books  and the wedding poem that Carrie Bradshaw wrote in Sex & the Citysomething Id planned to include in my wedding since I saw the episode

Shola got just a little choked up  but kept it together

I did not


After the ceremony we took a short boat ride to our cocktail hour



And then it was time to celebrate



Even though I didnt have bridesmaids  I had to have a photo op with the girls



Our cocktail hour was planned for outside  but due to a shower earlier that afternoon that soaked the lawn  it was moved to a nearby screened in porch that had a nice indooroutdoor feel Guests were greeted with our His & Hers cocktails I choose a Rose Paloma  mezcal & tequila based  my favorite  and Shola opted for Peaches & Bourbon for a nod to our southern setting


We settled on a coffee table book for our guest book with gorgeous images of New York City inside The sign next to it read Taking your well wishes back to NYC

Im always going to influencer events where fashion illustrators create amazing sketches of my look I thought it would make for a unique experience and lovely favor for our wedding guests and so searched high and low for a fashion illustrator based in SC

In keeping with the Greenery theme that won the most votes  BRIDES filled the reception space with palm leaves  cascading white floral & greenery arrangements of all sizes  and romantic candlelight


 
Our first dance was to Lovely Day by Bill Withers We wanted something classic and a bit upbeat Its one of Sholas favorite oldies




Smores are a favorite dessert of mine The Smores cart is famous at the Montage Palmetto Bluff and was parked just outside our reception venue

Shola comes from a Nigerian background  so after the cake cutting we slipped into Nigerian wedding attire for a Nigerian Money Dance While we danced guests tossed bills on us to represent hopes for good fortune It was a highlight of the night

Fall is my time to mix it up I love pairing different prints and textures and going for cozy layered looks Its also a time when I find myself mixing it up with my beauty and skincare products One thing Im trying for the first time is natural deodorant Ive of course been hearing about the health dangers of many of the deodorants out there for a while now  so Im finally trying to make the switch to au naturel I also heard that easing into a natural deodorant can take a few days for your body to get used to  so I feel like fall is the perfect time to transition  Ill be sweating a little less and covering up a little more Native asked me to try one of their seasonal sticks and I went for  what else  Pumpkin Spice Latte Yes  they go all out with festive fall scents How freakin cute is that Im sure there are a lot of Pumpkin Spice Latte lovers out there  so consider this one more way to ring in fall with your fave

Native also has a travel size set with their best selling scents + fall favorites I ordered this too

Finally sharing a few pics from our honeymoon After our BRIDES Live Wedding  the team sent us to gorgeous Cayman Islands to relax and keep the celebration going Keep scrolling for snaps throughout our week long honeymoon + my eatsleepdo list while in Cayman Islands

Luxury Cayman Villas spoiled us with a dream home on the water
Wheres Shola Lol

When on your honeymoon  I highly recommend a private beach in your own backyard

Our dreamy backyard also included an epic pool situation with two hot tubs


I love collecting sea shells while on vacay This one was a beaut
I have this thing with outdoor showers


Paddleboarding and kayaking were an unexpected daily activity for us The villa provided a few

Saved the best for last We also had our own private doc off our backyard beach Perfect for a lunchtime picnic or evening cuddle sesh outdoors

As part of BRIDES Live Wedding  you also had the chance to vote for an activity that we did while on our honeymoon The Sky & Sand package won  and so we embarked on a helicopter tour to Little Cayman for a picnic on the beach + snorkeling while there This was our view from above…

…and this was our chic AF private picnic on the beach

Peppers  We went there three times in one week Need I say more
Mango Tree  For no frills authentic food
Bacaro  Waterfront dining and the best dessert
Luxury Cayman Villas   there are several impeccably decorated properties
Bioluminescent Tour  Our favorite part of our trip Cayman Islands is also one of the few places  with an year round bioluminescent bay I highly recommend taking a kayak over the bottom glass boat No photos to share because this is an experience that cant be captured by everyday cameras You must truly live in and soak up the moment
Helicopter Tour with Cayman Helicopters  The water is so beautiful from above
Day trip or overnight to Little Cayman  If you like a more off the beaten path vibe  this little island delivers
Royal Palms Beach Club  For day party vibes

Also  special thank you to Cayman Airways for our first class seats & the comfiest of flights

Happy & safe travels
 
We New Yorkers need a lot of coats and this new one checks off all my boxes Its relaxed and not rigid  thin enough to layer  and cozy AF Definitely prime to be my go to piece all late fall and winter long Look out for me pairing it with a peasant dress and boots or layered under a midi length coat on particularly blustry days You might notice as youre scrolling through that its also reversible You can go fuzzy arms out for more of a statement or fuzzy arms in for a sleeker look

BRIDES  Why are you excited to be a part of BRIDES Live Wedding
Janelle  We arent the type to throw big parties for ourselves  especially since my mom is undergoing breast cancer treatment [Were happy to say shes now a survivor] Brides will help us plan a celebration fitting of the love we share
BRIDES  Whats your vision for the big day
Janelle  Were not overly traditional  so Id love for our wedding to feel relaxed I love an outdoor bohemian setting  palm trees  tropical vibes with a shot of glamour Signature his and hers cocktails and a dessert truck have always been a part of my yes list as well
BRIDES  How do you like the venue BRIDES selected  Montage Palmetto Bluff in South Carolina
Janelle  I couldnt be happier about it Im obsessed with all the Spanish moss in Palmetto Bluff  plus my dads parents moved to New York from South Carolina so its a meaningful location for my family Random  but one of my wishes was to have a fire pit at the rehearsal dinner and they have an area with three pits and a smores roast
BRIDES  What gets your heart pounding when you think of your wedding
Janelle  Aside from marrying the man of my dreams I cant wait to see how it all comes together with BRIDES at the helm

Cropped  high waisted  and preferably wide legged Lately  I cant wear my denim any other way This pair is the latest in my growing collection of denim of the exact aforementioned specifications Unique to these are the super frayed hem that give them a perfectly lived in  edgy vibe I like pairing them with more polished pieces like this oversized blazer and dainty heel  but theyll look equally amaze with a crop sweater or band tee Bloomies has been a denim source for me since my early days working there as an assistant buyer It was my very first job out of college and it was where I learned about all the cool and classic denim brands that a woman should invest in and have in her arsenal I still have my very first pair of designer jeans that I purchased with my first pay checkand it looks like bootcut might be making a comeback Lol You can get my look above and shop a few other croppedhigh waistwide leg wonders Im currently eyeing from Bloomingdales To me  theyre the perfect denim trend to wisk you right into fall A little breathing room and a peak of skin for those still warmish days

Dont you love those moments when you realize you have the perfect oufit to wear to something youve just been invited to attend I recently had the chance to go glamping and was probably a bit too excited to have the perfect look for the occasion This jumpsuit was ideal for exploring the camp grounds  gazing into binoculars  and making smores Im a firm believer in looking festive Its just so much more fun when you dress the part Shop my edit above for more exlporer approved styles from Banana Republic Think comfychic jumpsuits in khaki and olive green  a fabulous wide brim hat to shade you from the sun  and layering pieces to take you through a day of adventure


All these pieces are city approved as well Just add a strappy heel or crisp white kicks

We camped at Collective Retreats Its the cutest staycation idea for NYCers While youre on Governors Island  go for a bike ride and check out Island Oyster for the cool vibes and yummy cocktails

Say cheese

At first glance you might think  too preppy But take a closer look  Sperry challenged me to redefine preppy and mix their loafer style to make it my own  Penny loafers make me think of white dress shirts and I wanted to stay true to that After all  your outfit should kind of have a story so it doesnt feel too thrown together I liked the idea of going a bit bohemian  surprise  surprise  and wearing a slubby laid back take on a button down


 
Paired with a flare crop pant with frayed edges and layered gold necklaces  my look feels relaxed and timeless  I think I feel a new uniform coming on Whether classic pennies  mules  or sporty  the loafer look is a fun summer alternative and will transition seamlessly into fall You can shop my edit of Sperrys loafers above


 
I must say that this pair is the comfiest loafer Ive tried Move over sneakers And the leather is wearing quite nicely so far Im excited for this new addition to my wardrobe and cant wait to see how these babies wear over time

Cropped  high waisted  and preferably wide legged Lately  I cant wear my denim any other way This pair is the latest in my growing collection of denim of the exact aforementioned specifications Unique to these are the super frayed hem that give them a perfectly lived in  edgy vibe I like pairing them with more polished pieces like this oversized blazer and dainty heel  but theyll look equally amaze with a crop sweater or band tee Bloomies has been a denim source for me since my early days working there as an assistant buyer It was my very first job out of college and it was where I learned about all the cool and classic denim brands that a woman should invest in and have in her arsenal I still have my very first pair of designer jeans that I purchased with my first pay checkand it looks like bootcut might be making a comeback Lol You can get my look above and shop a few other croppedhigh waistwide leg wonders Im currently eyeing from Bloomingdales To me  theyre the perfect denim trend to wisk you right into fall A little breathing room and a peak of skin for those still warmish days

If youve been following along on @waityouneedthis  then you know Ive been obsessing over Mandy Moores recent home renovation since the first piece of terrazzo appeared on Instagram The finished home is total decor goals and I just cant get enough of it Ive come across one or two roundups to get the look  but Im finding them a bit price prohibitive  so I thought Id do a version that includes some more affordable options for you guys
Now for a design tip 
When looking to recreate a look  you dont have to search for the exact piece  or even a similar piece in the same color Use the overall lines and color story from the space as inspiration For example  if you cant find a waterfall bench  try a a table in the same silhouette Or if you love gold accents  but cant afford a metallic coffee table  try a side table or lamps instead Cant find turquoise chairs Try turquoise lamps and wall art I hope you feel inspired and sorry  not sorry  if after scrolling through this post you feel the need to completely redecorate your place

My guy has a great classic style He likes quality  understated pieces and is loyal to styles and fits he loves He likes to keep things simple  and youll completely loose him if you call his look an outfit When it comes to dressing up in summer  he prefers lightweight suits and easy layers  so when Bonobos reached out to ask us to style a summer wedding guest look  he was all in Bonobos makes shopping simple with across the board sizing Once you know his size  youre set No need to make him try on everything Their lightweight tux is ideal for summer affairs You wont compromise comfort for appearance with this look We switched up his usual tux style with a simple t shirt  crisp white kicks  and no socks for some seasonally appropriate swag Dont forget a pocket square for that formal touch A navy polka dot combo pops nicely against the black tux for something a bit unexpected

BRIDES  Why are you excited to be a part of BRIDES Live Wedding

BRIDES  Whats your vision for the big day
Janelle  Were not overly traditional  so Id love for our wedding to feel relaxed I love an outdoor bohemian setting  palm trees  tropical vibes with a shot of glamour Signature his and hers cocktails and a dessert truck have always been a part of my yes list as well
BRIDES  How do you like the venue BRIDES selected  Montage Palmetto Bluff in South Carolina
Janelle  I couldnt be happier about it Im obsessed with all the Spanish moss in Palmetto Bluff  plus my dads parents moved to New York from South Carolina so its a meaningful location for my family Random  but one of my wishes was to have a fire pit at the rehearsal dinner and they have an area with three pits and a smores roast

When summer comes  my friends and I look for every excuse to be outside I love to have gatherings in my apartment buildings outdoor space  but because its shared  theres not a tone of time to prep or fawn over every detail Im no Martha Stewart  but Ive honed my skills for entertaining outdoors with a few simple elements that will help you and your soiree look totally pulled together Keep scrolling for them all
Keep it simple by offering one signature cocktail You can tell friends youll be serving a Ketel Botanicals & Soda or other universally yummy libation and that theyre also welcome to BYOB A signature cocktail helps set the vibe and always serving one will quickly become your signature
 
Monstera leaves are my all time go to when it comes to simple table settings Just purchase a bundle and spread them flat on the table in a perfectly imperfect way  Theyre like a tablecloth  placemat  and centerpiece all in one We then added succulents and a few lanterns to the mix for a lush  textured feeling table
For food  no need to have a full on menu planned Choose pretty bowls and plates and fill them with your favorite  weather appropriate  snacks Your guests will graze as they chat it up

Im a firm believer in capturing moments  and I want my guests to look great for them Dont feel shy about suggesting an easy dress code like prints  neutrals  or wearing a flower in your hair Choose something simple that everyone likely has in their closet anyway

Little details like cute cocktail napkins and festive drink accessories are a memorable touch your guests will appreciate I prefer festive cloth napkins that can be reused  but you can also find fancy paper products that make cleaning a cinch

I recently had the lovely opportunity to stop by Burberry HQ and have my make up done by the one and only Wendy Rowe to celebrate Burberrys latest complexion product  Fresh Glow Stick Gel I always covet glowing skin Whenever an artist does my makeup I ask the same thing Can you just make me look glowy I dont always get what I want  but Fresh Glow Stick Gel is made for a glowy looking complexion

I chatted with Wendy about the new product and then she went to work on giving me a glowing  radiant look She seemed to feel her way through the entire application  using her fingers instead of this brush for this and that brush for that  and going back to products she had already used She kept saying that you really cant make mistakes with these product  which was so refreshing to hear The stick is super easy to apply and throw in your bag on the go  too Im also loving using a lighter shade as a concealer

Another product from the day that I was into is the Fresh Glow highlighter Just a few sweeps along your cheekbone and you instantly look fresh and…wait for it…glowy Plus  Im officially a color on my lower lids girl Wendy applied a bronzey color right along my lower lash line  same color that she used on my upper lid  and gently smudged it in So easy to recreate After my appointment  I took the products home to create a look myself What do you think

Do you change scents from season to season Well its time to treat yourself to a new springsummer scent I love marking a new season with a new fragrance Spring and summer scents are hands down my favorite

They can be fresh or floral Crisp or warm One thing that they always do for me is perk me up in the morning and set the tone for the day Because even if youre going into the office  you can still smell like you just ran through a field of flowers The city can be so hectic sometimes and us busy girl bosses have to know how to find a little peace in all the crazy  amiright

I discovered Tocca fragrances at Sephora and I love the meaning behind the scent I picked up Tocca Maya  which has a rare combination of ingredients that is meant to exude confidence and strength of character Its a floral scent that feels feminine  warm  and a bit complicated Kinda like yours truly 🙂 It reminds me of long summer strolls through Central Park after the rain…you know  that fresh and almost sweet scent that exhales from the ground like a sigh after a long hot day Find the fragrance thats right for you and switch it up this season You never know how your new scent might inspire you

We recently had some friends visiting for an extended stay and I really wanted them to feel at home They are big coffee lovers so I knew they would be delighted to wake up to a sweet coffee bar each morning Creating an at home coffee bar was simple and fun to pull together
 First  youll need a Keurig for easy at home brewing This one is the new Keurig® K Elite™ coffee maker It works well for our household because Im not an everyday coffee drinker and my fiancé  Shola  drinks it on the daily It also has the simplest controls  is super quiet  important in our tiny home   and brews tea  hot cocoa  and iced coffee too My favorite part of the coffee bar is the letter board I had fun changing the message each morning for our guests Keep scrolling for a checklist for everything you need to create your own at home coffee bar  plus a few inspiring morning quotes for your coffee bar letter board

Heres all you need to create your own coffee bar at home

Thanks so much for supporting the brands that  support this blogIve been trying to get more serious about my skincare  and the easiest way to feel like Im making an effort has been to get serious about SPF But as youve probably heard   you need to reapply your SPF every two hours to be fully protected Im like  umm  I have a full face of makeup on so forget it Well  Supergoop felt our pain and launched a new SPF 45 in setting powder form

Use it to set your makeup in the morning and then dust it on throughout the day to refresh your SPF I went for translucent because Im used to using setting powder in that shade  but it comes in light  medium  and deep as well

Now  I chatted with the Supergoop team and think its important to mention that this should not replace whatever other SPFs youve woven into your routine I use Supergoops Unseen as a base  after a toner and serum  and eye cream with SPF around my peepers  followed by a BB cream with SPF  and finish off my makeup application with the setting powder for three total layers of UV protection Id also recommend a hat for days youll be walking out and about outside

Plus  I take extra care every single day to protect my eye area and never leave home without a great pair of sunnies or a hat to block my eyes from unnecessary sun exposure Pro tip  Because Im always protecting my face  I like to use a sunless tannerespecially in winter monthsto give myself a healthy looking glow

SHOP MY SWEAT EDIT 
Strolling around New York first thing in the morning before the city gets to crowded is one of my favorite things to do Ill put on one of my strutting soundtracks and go for a long walk through my hood I start by grabbing a juice  Im obsessed with beet juice right now  and head out for some fresh flowers or to my go to magazine stand Its one of the ways I practice self care So is being comfy While I like to be comfortable  for me looking good is part of feeling good no matter the time of day I found a load of crazy soft sweatpants and sweatshirts while shopping the Lou & Grey site Theirs have subtle fashion forward elements like extra long side slits  playful stripes  and come in great color palettes that set them apart from the boring sweats youre used to Im digging the flared legs on this pair of sweats so much Theyll give you instant cool girl vibes for your next morning stroll

If you marched yesterday  caught the coverage in the news  or spied the crowds of like minded communities while scrolling through your IG feed  then like me  youre probably still high on all the fem feels Its undeniable that the future is female So in that spirit  heres another dose of to keep the vibes going I combed the web for ten kick ass quotes that speak to me from women who have paved the way Grab your girl power gear and lets do this
2018  were ready for ya…

Im tough  Im ambitious  and I know exactly what I want If that makes me a bitch  okay ―Madonna

I love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels Lifes a bitch Youve got to go out and kick ass Maya Angelou
Feminism isnt about making women strong Women are already strong Its about changing the way the world perceives that strength GD Anderson

I am a woman with thoughts and questions and shit to say I say if Im beautiful I say if Im strong You will not determine my story–I will Amy Schumer
Of course I am not worried about intimidating men The type of man who will be intimidated by me is exactly the type of man I have no interest in ―Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

Ive never met a woman who is not strong  but sometimes they dont let it out Then theres a tragedy  and then all of a sudden that strength comes My message is let the strength come out before the tragedy Diane von Furstenberg
If you want something said  ask a man  if you want something done  ask a woman Margaret Thatcher

I just love bossy women I could be around them all day To me  bossy is not a pejorative term at all It means somebodys passionate and engaged and ambitious and doesnt mind leading Amy Poehler
Who run the world Girls Beyoncé

Tomorrow is Giving Tuesday  a global day of giving that kicks off the charitable season Were all guilty of getting a little preoccupied with our shopping lists this time of year  so its nice to have a reminder that the holidays arent just about giving gifts  but about giving back This Giving Tuesday  Im beyond excited to be an ambassador for the Leggs Walk Tall initiative to empower women in the workplace in partnership with Dress for Success I mean  talk about a timely and important cause We talk about finding your tribe a lot on social media Dress for Success is the ultimate tribe whose mission is to empower women to achieve economic independence by providing a network of support  workwear  and the toolkit to become girlboss in work and in life  If you are not familiar with Dress for Success I highly recommend visiting DressForSuccessorg to learn more and get involved with your local affiliate
As a Walk Tall ambassador  I had the opportunity to style two deserving future boss babes  currently enrolled in the Dress for Success career program  in items from DFS NYC showroom As women  we get pulled in so many directions and have near impossible expectations to meet  It can sometimes be tough to Walk Tall through the world  and I believe that our clothes can work as a sort of armor that keeps us feeling empowered all day I had the loveliest time getting to know Mary and Deniza  hear their journeys  and understand their senses of style It was important to put them in clothes that not only look great  but make them feel confident I put the finishing touches on each look with a pair of Leggs which are perfect when going for a sleek  pulled together work look Theyre also budget friendly
DFS is always in need of fresh pieces to help stock their showroom from young women with stylethats where you come in Next time youre cleaning out your closet consider donating your gently used workwear  shoes  and accessories to DFS to help give women the confidence to crush it in their careers and lives What a stylish way to give back  no
If youre too in love with your wardrobe to part with any pieces  or you want to do even more to support a fellow boss babe  you can donate here to Dress for Success this Giving Tuesday A donation of $20 means career counseling sessions that will help her gain the confidence to Walk Tall into a job interview
Speaking of interviews  keep scrolling for a little interview I did with Leggs  where I chat about what the Dress For Success mission means to me  my Walk Tall mantra  go to power pieces you should have in your closet  and more

Leggs  What does walking tall mean to you
Me  For me  walking tall means living out your passion confidently and bringing your whole mind  body  and individual style to whatever you do Its so easy to play it safe and go with the status quo  but if you walk tall  youre bound to stand out
Leggs  Why is Dress for Success an organization worth supporting
Me  The importance of community among women has been a hot topic recently Dress for Success has spent two decades bringing like minded women together to develop the tools and style to pursue the careers of their dreams If you want to see more women running things in the workplace  DFS is the perfect organization to support The future is female  after all
Leggs  Whats your personal mantra to always remember to walk tall
Me  I love this quote…The only person better than you is buried deep inside of you Its my reminder to break out of my comfort zone and leave an impression on the world  because no one else will do it quite like me
Leggs  What outfit gives you the most confidence to walk tall
I like to pair feminine pieces with something more masculine  like a great fitting blazer Feeling feminine is a source of power for me And heels  of course Not sky high ones  but sturdy ones that make me feel tall and in control  yet grounded
Leggs  What are other things that inspire you to walk tall
Me  My tribe of friends are all boss babes with entrepreneurial mindsets They inspire me to take risks and own my career and journey

As a Walk Tall ambassador  I had the opportunity to style two deserving future boss babes  currently enrolled in the Dress for Success career program  in items from DFS NYC showroom As women  we get pulled in so many directions and have near impossible expectations to meet  It can sometimes be tough to Walk Tall through the world  and I believe that our clothes can work as a sort of armor that keeps us feeling empowered all day I had the loveliest time getting to know Mary and Deniza  hear their journeys  and understand their senses of style It was important to put them in clothes that not only look great  but make them feel confident I put the finishing touches on each look with a pair of Leggs which are perfect when going for a sleek  pulled together work look Theyre also budget friendly
DFS is always in need of fresh pieces to help stock their showroom from young women with stylethats where you come in Next time youre cleaning out your closet consider donating your gently used workwear  shoes  and accessories to DFS to help give women the confidence to crush it in their careers and lives What a stylish way to give back  no
If youre too in love with your wardrobe to part with any pieces  or you want to do even more to support a fellow boss babe  you can donate here to Dress for Success this Giving Tuesday A donation of $20 means career counseling sessions that will help her gain the confidence to Walk Tall into a job interview
Speaking of interviews  keep scrolling for a little interview I did with Leggs  where I chat about what the Dress For Success mission means to me  my Walk Tall mantra  go to power pieces you should have in your closet  and more

Leggs  What does walking tall mean to you
Me  For me  walking tall means living out your passion confidently and bringing your whole mind  body  and individual style to whatever you do Its so easy to play it safe and go with the status quo  but if you walk tall  youre bound to stand out
Leggs  Why is Dress for Success an organization worth supporting
Me  The importance of community among women has been a hot topic recently Dress for Success has spent two decades bringing like minded women together to develop the tools and style to pursue the careers of their dreams If you want to see more women running things in the workplace  DFS is the perfect organization to support The future is female  after all
Leggs  Whats your personal mantra to always remember to walk tall
Me  I love this quote…The only person better than you is buried deep inside of you Its my reminder to break out of my comfort zone and leave an impression on the world  because no one else will do it quite like me
Leggs  What outfit gives you the most confidence to walk tall
I like to pair feminine pieces with something more masculine  like a great fitting blazer Feeling feminine is a source of power for me And heels  of course Not sky high ones  but sturdy ones that make me feel tall and in control  yet grounded
Leggs  What are other things that inspire you to walk tall
Me  My tribe of friends are all boss babes with entrepreneurial mindsets They inspire me to take risks and own my career and journey

Im not big on overly leggy looks  but theres something about an oversized sweater & mini skirt combo that gets me every time I popped by Express recently to start stocking up for fall I found a sea of oversized sweaters in silhouettes ranging from deep v neck to off the shoulder and mini skirts in fall ready textures from leather to velvet Its textures like these make the end of warmer days a little less bittersweet Needless to say  I was a bit in heaven while shopping the racks and will be showing a little more leg until NYC freezes over
Right now until 1115  you can stop into any Express store and use my code ‘2004 to receive $25 off your in store purchase of $100 or more Terms and conditions apply

Bridal Fashion Week was last week here in NYC As a bride to be  it was lovely to see so many dresses up close and to get inspired for my big day But why wait until then Im always on the hunt for delicate  white dresses to pair with black boots and rock with my go to moto jacket I love the mix of tough and soft  feminine and edgy My absolute soft spot is a long sleeve midi like this number I had the pleasure of attending their insiders bridal fashion week event in partnership with WeddingWirecom and was floored by the number easy  breezy wedding dresses that I could see myself wearing again and again New Yorkers  or if youre ever visiting New York City  you must book an appointment at the BHLDN NYC showroom I loved the romantic and eclectic decor almost as much as the gowns Definitely insta worthy

If you dont have a go to black moto yet  or two   stop right now and shop these It will make transitioning any delicate  summery piece into fall a breeze I recommend investing in a quality one because it will definitely get its fair share of wear  but there are options out there for every budget

Ive been loving experimenting with all kinds of skin care products lately  but theres just something about a classic You remember this one If youre anything like me  it was the first skin care product you ever coveted Thinking back  Clinique was one of the first brands I fell in love with Ive always been drawn to the pretty pastel packaging  approachable products  overall happy disposition that Clinique radiates They just know how to make a girl feel effortlessly beautiful So  imagine my excitement when Clinique reached out to me to do a shoot in studio with the Glamour team More on that later…

Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+ has the same look you know and love  but now packs double the hydration and environmental protection Its perfect for this New Yorkers dry skin and has become one of my skin care essentials for both day and night use Its the only facial lotion I need when traveling  just add SPF   so its what I brought this past week to visit my parents back home in Atlanta How serendipitous that I would do this little at home shoot in my old bedroom where I first fell in love with Clinique

Now  about the big shoot with Glamour…It was truly one of the funnest experiences Ive had as a blogger to date The Glamour crew  glam squad  stylist  and lovely photography team made me feel like a real model  but were also super patient with my lazy eyes  you have no idea of the number of half asleep images Ive amassed over years of blogging  and gave me plenty of room to goof around Heres the Glamour spread from this months issue  pinch me  Im in print  and a few behind the scenes snaps from set with Cyndi & Thania Both these ladies rock  so definitely check them out  and check out Cliniques must have moisturizer right here

Upon meeting me  Ill likely ask you a barrage of personal questions right away Its not because Im nosy Its because I want to get to the good stuff Small talk isnt really my thing I want to know what youre passionate about I want to know your insides 
I love having thoughtful  open  heartfelt discussion with like minded women Thanks to The Refined Woman and Anthropologie  I had the pleasure of sharing a gorgeous meal  and several bottles of bubbly  with a handful of creative and vibrant women on the cutest of rooftops in Harlem From the food to the flowers to the new found friendships  it was an evening worth cherishing We spoke candidly about finding balance  finding friendships  and finding headspace in this crazy city We got real and I walked away with some new additions to my tribe that I cant wait to get to know better  collaborate with  and support in all they do You know that  saying…you cant pick your family  but you can pick your friends I firmly believe that a womans tribe of friends is essential to her fulfillment and success  so choose wisely I love this quote from Amy Poehler on building her tribe…

If youve been visiting my little corner of the internet for a while  then you might be surprised to see me in a short skirt I NEVER where them Im much more comfortable in maxi skirts and dresses or down right muumuus But the corduroy mini skirt is making a comeback  and since Im partial to many things seventies inspired  I finally slipped one on in a French Connection fitting room Paired with an oversized knit  classic stripes  and thigh high suede boots  this look feels very Brady Bunch meets Chloe to me  and theres nothing wrong with that Extra points if the skirt buttons down for that extra hint of nostalgia

Chinos are such a classic piece  but I hadnt really every tried incorporating them into my wardrobe When Anthropologie asked me to style a pair  I had my reservations But after a few minutes playing in my closet  I quickly realized that the relaxed fit of this pair is very much aligned with my personal style I went about pairing them with twists on other classic pieces  like a striped shirt updated with a bell sleeve and a jacket thats taken on a kimono like silhouettedont you just die over the details on this kimono jacket  though I rode the wave of my already eclectic choices with a pair of statement earring Theyre leather Once I went that far  how else could I top off the look than with a leopard print bootie Am I right Heels  of course  to balance out the boyish fit of the chino This look was definitely a lesson in pairing unexpected pieces  and I hope it inspires you to mix two  or three  or four  pieces that you might not have thought to pair before Extra points for prints and embellishment Have fun

New Years Eve is synonymous with short sequin dresses  but this year the cold NYC weather has me wanting to sport something on the cozier side For a look thats equal parts festive and warm try pairing a party sweater and a little ear bling Whats a party sweater you ask Its any sweater that has that extra element of sparkle or special detail Extra points if it shimmers I found a few from LOFT that foot the bill The one Im rocking is particularly soft and has a subtle silver threading running throughout You could also go for one with sequin embellishment or maybe even a sexy  off the shoulder silhouette Whatever you wear  I hope you have a lovely New Years Eve and a Happy New Year

Suns out  nips out  I shot this look while on a quick work trip to LA More on that later For now  I want to tell you about a new app Im into where I scored this top and kicks…

I get approached by fashion app developers a lot  and find it tough to see the value add from one app to the next But I just discovered one that I can get behind Its called LUVIT and it gives you a 25% referral fee for purchases your followers make on items youve LUVd or shared That means youll finally get paid for being the designated stylist of your girl squad You also get a little cash back in your pocket on purchases you make for yourself Plus  the app is clean and pretty  which is always a bonus in my book The app will be live in a few weeks but you can join the waitlist to get early access here Oh and be sure to follow me on the app @waityouneedthis for my picks Ill be updating them weekly Happy shopping

Finally sharing my graduation look I wore this tea length cocktail dress for my graduation from business school back in May Maxis are usually my go to for daytime celebrations  however since I had to wear a graduation gown over my look for much of the day  I opted for a dress with a similar hemline This cocktail dress did the trick I have to say that it fit like a gloveno all day pulling and tugging like with many strapless dresses Plus  the exposed zipper and sheer tulle hem added the ideal dose of edge to keep the look from feeling to precious

As you might know  Ive been busy earning an MBA at NYU Stern for the past two years Well  I did it Ill be graduating this Friday and of course  Ill need the perfect outfit for the big day So I was ecstatic when Barneys New York invited me to come shopping and find a killer grad day look I chose a gorgeous Prabal Gurung dress that was equal parts flouncy and fitted for a bohemian  yet pulled together feelmy ideal vibe for basically every look Click over to The Window to see the full story
Plus  to celebrate the class of 2016  during the month of May  all graduates who spend $250 in store at Barneys New York will receive $25 to be redeemed in June

 Ive been pretty into skincare lately and have been adding a new products to my daily cleansing routine After a few months of testing  the results are in and I wanted to share my thoughts with you on a few favorites

I have fairly dry skin  so when Im in need of some intense hydration  I apply Glossiers Moisturizing Moon Mask It gives my face that ahhhhh feeling After 20 minutes my skin is plumper  less tight  and extra hydrated Ive also been using the Mega Greens Galaxy Pack Glossier calls it a juice cleanse for your face and I agree Its a kind a clay mask that detoxifies and draws out oils Because my skin is on the dryer side  Ive been using it sparingly when I feel like I need an extra refresh or I feel a blemish coming on Glossiers Priming Moisturizer is a real favorite Its light  yet creamy and just feels like it works Plus  its the perfect size to toss in my carry on for all my jetset moments

I have dark under eye circles that can make me look tired even when Im not Chanels Sublimage La Creme Yeux Ultimate Regeneration Eye Cream gives a bit of life to my under eyes The effect is subtle  but instant and anti aging ingredients are killer

BOSCIA Balancing Facial Tonic is my morning thirst quencher I love to spritz it on my face and neck right after I hop out of the shower Its meant to banish impurities that you might miss when cleansing and give an extra step in preventing dehydration  but I mostly just love the luxurious feeling of misting it on each morning

Peet Rivko is a very cool skincare line that a friend of mine from business school and her facialist are launching this summer They swear by this balancing face oil  and now so do I I apply just a few drops on my finger tips and then tap them across my face I follow it up by gently rubbing in a moisturizer which ensures the oil also gets spread evenly on my skin

ORIGINS Make A Difference Plus + Rejuvenating Treatment is another moisturizer that Im loving to apply day and night when Im not using the one from Glossier The texture has a cooling gel effect that feels oh so good on my tired face in the morning and equally soothes my skin before sleep The Drink Up Intensive Overnight Mask from Origins is also a favorite First of all  it smells AMAZING My boyfriend cant help but comment each time I wear it to bed that I smell like mangos  and then scoot a bit closer to me I also love that the mask is transparent and theres nothing to peel off Just let your skin soak it up through the night and rinse your face in the morning

Wide legged and hardware free  these dungarees are the adult version of the overalls you once loved Since it was still a bit breezy last weekend here in NYC  I played the layer game with a light sweater and turtleneck Id never thought of layering underneath overalls before but the subtle pop of stripes makes the whole look so much more interesting  dont you think Layering aside  the low back silhouette has me dreaming of pairing these dungarees with a flowy little crop top come summer Stay tuned

Here are a few resolutions I hope to make stick 

Buy organic basics  Non organic cotton is the second most chemically sprayed crop out there A simple cotton t shirt  for example  takes a third of a pound of synthetic fertilizers to make Yikes
Cut back on red meat  Im by no means a huge red meat eater but learning that it takes around 840 gallons of fresh water to produce 1 serving of red meat makes me want to switch over to turkey burgers for good
Carry a reusable water bottle  always  Because recycling is tough on the go and this one is such a no brainer Im eyeing this leak proof bottle that I can throw in my everyday tote with no worries
 
To Mamma Earth  Happy Earth Day

To my surprise  one of my favorite experiences while in Cambodia was a cooking class along the Siem Reap countryside Like most days while in Cambodia  I awoke bright and early  this time to make my way to the market where I would learn about each of the ingredients that would go into the food Id be preparing later that afternoon

After finishing up at the market  my group headed to an outdoor kitchen tucked away in the countryside of Siem Reap There we spent hours preparing spring rolls  amok  a traditional Cambodian cuisine  and a to die for pumpkin custard under the supervision of the warmest and most seasoned chefs one could hope to learn from Between the vibrant market  beautiful countryside landscape  kind instructors  and beyond flavorful foods  it was an authentic and memorable experience that my heart  and stomach  craves to have again

Keep scrolling for a very simple recipe for this glorious pumpkin custard

 The weather in NYC has been especially schizophrenic lately  so getting dressed for the elements can be complicated Coat Jacket Layers And you know that thing when its warm on the sunny side of the street and cold on the shady side For a day of shopping for plants for my apartment  I opted to layer this printed blanket cardigan  on sale  over a leather jacket The effect was a transitional look that was a pleasant change from the winter coats Ive been rocking for months  and it still had the right amount of warmth for a 57 degrees in February kind of day In lieu of my usually snood scarf  I tied a bandana around my neck for just the added amount of coverage from the subtle chill still in the air

Im all about layering simple pieces lately  like this workwear button up and breezy dress  I sported the dress a alone for brunch with friends and then tied a button up over top for window shopping once the cool late afternoon air hit Just like that  a dress becomes a skirt Plus  a button up is much more light weight than lugging a jacket around  no Opt for clean accessories in neutral tones like this circle cross body bag and wedge espadrilles to keep the look feeling light

Luxe knits  easy denim  delicate lace  and fringe detail are just a few of the trends from H&M‘s fall collection helping to pacify my feelings about summers end My sister and I stepped out in this duster sweater and unstructured jacket  and took the collection for a test drive Wear these transitional pieces now over summer frocks and later in between winter layers When you have pieces like these to pile on  bring on the crisp  fall breeze

    
 
While I love experimenting with trends  new silhouettes  and statement pieces  theres nothing like throwing on a few of my go to basics for a look thats totally me So when StyleList asked me to put together a look that emulates my style  I knew just where to start Boyfriend jeans are a staple in my wardrobe I count on them to bring a cool girl vibe to any outfit A billowy peasant top adds a breezy  bohemian feel I like to let it fall off my shoulder for a touch of sex appeal Paired with a wide brim wool hat and classic black ankle boots  its an easy  urban look thats perfect for exploring the streets of New York City
