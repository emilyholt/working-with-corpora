While out running errands in LA I wore none other than my infamous\u00a0Target green cardigan\u00a0(similar here and here) from my Aimee on a Budget video. To style it, I took the belt off of it and tied it to give the cardigan a more summery feel. I'm excited to transition it &hellip;

I've been home recently from traveling and I have to say, it's so refreshing. I like to come home and recharge, see my family, and be at the office. Since I'm back in the full swing of things, I thought to share my Friday favorites I've been routinely using or wearing in the past week. &hellip;

So I recently asked my Instagram followers what outfits I wore they would like to see on my team. My team is composed on smart, fashionable girls so I went for looks they normally wouldn't go for and asked them to record others reactions to see if their fashion risks paid off. Well, I think &hellip;

On the newest episode of, Aimee Tries Things, I tried becoming a mermaid for a day at Shores Mermaid School. Sophia, Laura, and I all went to a mermaid class and tried to be as graceful as the sea creatures themselves. Needless to say, it was hard and A LOT of work...\n&hellip;

Recently, I've been into the patchwork trend. Maybe it's the fun mixing of patterns or the revival of all the old trends coming back. I wore a\u00a0Cinq a Sept patchwork midi dress\u00a0(also available\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0here) in the Hamptons. And I have been also obsessed with my Dior patchwork saddle bag&hellip;

White is clean, classic, and fresh. I like to wear white a lot because it makes me feel refreshed. Winter white, or a bright white, is always a good idea to wear in the summer for an elevated, chic look. So, I wore a Zimmermann white polka dot midi dress (sold out but similar here&hellip;

I have long been a midi dress fan. One reason is because I think the silhouette is chic and identify midi dresses as a summer staple. You can dress them up or down and they keep you cool especially in humid climates. I wore this\u00a0Cinq a Sept patchwork midi dress\u00a0(also available here&hellip;

With August comes the end of summer. The days slowly become shorter, school goes back into session, and fashion week is just around the corner. My Friday favorites this week are going to focus on some stuff I loved about my summer as it draws to a close so you can get your end of &hellip;

She is known for designing Meghan Markle's wedding dress too. But her &hellip;

The iconic\u00a0Dior saddle bag made a major comeback last week, and I have been loving my\u00a0saddle bag - so much that I decided just having one bag is not enough. So, I ordered a vintage version from\u00a0eBay\u00a0(I featured it in the\u00a0July unboxing). It goes perfectly with my outfit.&hellip;

It's no surprise I am wearing yet another Rixo London galaxy print dress (more Rixo London here\u00a0and\u00a0similar here and here). I wore a\u00a0mini version in Paris and now I went for the maxi version. What I really am into is the galaxy print because it's more elevated than a regular floral &hellip;

Dior creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, revamped the iconic Dior saddle bag and &hellip;

One of my most asked questions is where are\u00a0my A.S. initial necklaces from? To answer you guys, the\u00a0Chlo\u00e9 initial necklace\u00a0is one I wear almost every day.

Feeling sticky in humid weather is the worst. I'm lucky that here in Southern California it\u2019s dry and hot about 90% of the time throughout the year.

I get so many questions about the camera I use for Instagram, Youtube, &hellip;

Finding shoes that are office appropriate in the summer is a struggle. Sometimes the AC blasted office isn't sandal friendly and other times you can go casual for Friday.
