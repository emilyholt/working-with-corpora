The weather in LA finally feels like fall Just last week it was in the 100s  but thats LA for ya My go-to outfit when Im in LA this time of year is some kind of denim and a blouse or knit top Because it isnt too cold and the sun came out  Ive decided

Ive been trying to think of where my obsession with puffy shoulder pieces started and Im pretty sure its from my mom She was always very stylish  and I remember seeing her wear puffy shoulder blazers and thinking that she looked like such a powerful businesswoman Its funny though because when I got older and 

Had such a great day last week I thought I was going to be in LA for a while  but something exciting came up and Im actually writing this from NYC right now While I was in LA though  since I was gone for so long  I decided to take my team roller skating since

I always look forward to The Hamptons weekend every summer Ive gotten to go for the last three years in a row and its such a great time being with my Revolve family and all the other bloggers that I dont get to see very often Not to mention its beautiful there I really wish 

Kimonos and robes are the perfect piece of outerwear for the warmer months Theyre lightweight and come in every combination of material  color  and pattern  which makes them perfect for any occasion You know I always look for pieces that I can wear more than one time or only for more than just one thing 

Its that time of year again The Nordstrom Anniversary Sale is open to the public today  and Ive already been doing some looking around Theres sooooo much good stuff right now  and I realized that I lot of the items look like pieces that I already have  so I included some of those so you

Paris has been amazing so far With a less busy schedule  Ive been able to explore the city more and hang out with my friends I found some great restaurants and cafes that I havent been to before that I cant wait to share with you They weather has been super unpredictable the last few 

Summer is in full effect Im like always cold and I dont generally sweat  so I actually like this heat wave that were currently in right now It gives me an excuse to trade in the jeans for something more fun like this ASOS summer dress  which is perfect for wearing from daytime into 

My last outfit post from Paris this season In my book  Capture Your Style  I mention that in order to get the best photos when youre traveling especially at super touristy places like the Eiffel Tower you should go super early in the morning before the crowds of people show up I generally aim 

Paris is always amazing--every season  hot or cold  sunny or snowing  Paris is always amazing But this time for fashion week  it was even better than usual We only did one thing different this time  which was we stayed in a different hotel--the Plaza Athenee Apart from being in a really great location  

So excited to share the reveal of the powder room in my new house If youre subscribed to my YouTube channel  you may have already seen it in this video  but Im so in love with how it turned out that I needed to share some photos on the blog I wanted this

I actually didnt have any shows to go to in Paris yesterday so I got to explore the city more the whole day I really love doing Haute Couture week because its not as busy and rushed as the other fashion weeks  which means that you can actually enjoy the shows without worrying if youre 

Had such a great first show of the season at Proenza Schouler Im so excited for the pieces to be available--there were a lot of great patterns and I had a little feeling that there would be some feathers involved  because the invite had a lot of feathers sticking out and I was not wrong 

The 4th of July is definitely the most popular time for summer parties Some people like to plan trips for the 4th of July weekend  but my favorite thing to do is staying in LA with my friends  family  and dogs and enjoying the warm weather Everyone gets together for a barbecue or to hang 

Even though jeans and denim in general are my go-to  theres nothing that can compare to a asymmetrical or ruffle dresses Theyre feminine  dressy  comfortable  and easy to wear Since there are definitely asymmetrical or ruffle dresses for every situation and there are so many reasons to wear a pretty dress during the summer  Ive

The metallic trend has been in for a few seasons now  and one of the best ways to incorporate it into your summer wardrobe is with a killer pair of metallic sandals Ive had my eye on a few lately like these ones from The Row  and the Isabel Marant ones below--theyre under $300

I was in desperate need of a tropical vacation  and since there isnt one on my calendar any time soon  I decided I would just make it happen here in LA All you really need is some warm weather  and the perfect straw hat to have a nice little staycation Jacopo even came to see 

Warm weathers official pattern is stripes  which I think everyone knows We all love stripes  but this season I feel like more and more people are gravitating towards polka dots instead I know that Ive had my eye on a few polka dot pieces lately so I created this guide of polka dot dresses  tops

One of my goals for the year was to create a Two Songs tee each month whose proceeds would go to a non-profit organization centered around the theme of that month For example  for Breast Cancer Awareness Month  I created the rose tits tee whose proceedswent to a breast cancer charity Unfortunately  designing a

The two things I always make sure to bring with me when Im traveling are my passport  and my beauty bag I havent decided which one would be worse to forgetknock on wood it never happens Because planes are so dry and stuffy  I never wear makeup on board  and I focus on keeping moisturized 

This season I have been seeing a lot of these basket style bags  and I really love how lighthearted and easy they are They remind me of a picnic  but at the same time could be worn to the office or to the beach Ive listed a bunch of my favorite ones that Ive seen 

I travel a lot  and a part of traveling  for me  is to take the best photos that I can when Im at a destination In my book  Capture Your Style  I teach you how to just how to do that This guide is similar  but less technical--its not so much about how to use

Denim is something that I wear all year round I mean  Im not the only person to do that  but I like to have more fun with denim in the summer because you can break out the skirts and play with different crops  etc The biggest denim trend lately has been the two-toned pieces  and

Every season of fashion week there are different shows that blow my mind for different reasons Chanel is always one of those shows  whether its for the collection  or the venue They always take it to the next level  and every time Im left wondering 

While I was in Paris I tried to make as much use of the outerwear I had as possible  because I knew that as soon as I got back to LA it was going to be a thousand degrees and I would be forced to wear hot weather clothing I fell in love with this

Throughout fashion month Ive been keeping track ofsome trends that appeared at the shows I attended  one of them and my personal favorite being ruffles Some of you may have seen ruffles popping up on your favorite shopping sites for a while now  but Ive decided to make things a little easier by making
