I didnt plan for this but when the stars align your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai and voilá   magic happens  Expect nothing less when staying here as the resort is truly magical and unique

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members  club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback riding and swimming The only problem Leaving it 

Located in my favourite part of New York the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious authentic Milanese treats Having already eaten my way through the menu this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly Yes folks Italians do it better   even avocado toast

In early December I ve had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin s historic post war buildings and world s first concept mall an incredible space overlooking the German capital s zoo If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes one more great art addition to this space s brilliance

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends the peacocks emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple every of the mealsa treat the service beyond of everything you ve ever experienced making you feel like you re home If there s heaven I guess I ve already found it Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas the manager Mr Abhishek the most attentive person I ve ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world 


The concept of a traveling fashionista wasnt very hard to see the models had boarding tags in their hair and on their clothes The hair and makeup did not go unnoticed the amazing Eugene Souleiman and the legendary Pat McGrath stood behind the creative and fun looks

Seeing sneakers at a couture show isnt something you usually witness but doing so was refreshing and if someone could pull it off it would be the great John Galliano

Beautiful pictures It is nice to notice the idea behind these dresses; woman in a rush
Thanks

I LOVE Maison Margiela youre so lucky that youve been there  Especially John Galliano is a pure genius and he was one of my most fav designers at House of Dior The work he does for Margiela is amazing and I think they didnt have a better designer because his creativity is endless

I cant begin to try and understand or dissect the work of John Galliano As a creative being I am in awe of the great work of John Galliano Im so glad hes back

Acclaimed for his distinctly glamorous and seductive designs Peter Dundas eponymous label is all about that and some more His black S S17 shimmering dress is my favorite piece from his debut collection and it truly is the perfect LBD to channel you inner diva

With one of the hottest tickets in the world of fashion I have the honor to magically teleport you to Pierpaolo Piccoli s incredibly beautiful world the world of Valentino Maison Valentino s SS17 Haute Couture show was not just another Haute Couture moment but a dream skillfully translated into reality Actually it is Pierpaolo s dream the sole creative director of the house who artfully orchestrated a very modern fairytale whose significance will be remembered for years Not only because he feasted our senses with the goose bumping intensity of the exclusive musical score by the great Master Alexandre Desplat but also because he just gave to fashion the biggest lesson  That simplicity is the greatest ability Graceful shapes and cuts sculpted pleats chiffon braids delicate hand stitched frills a marvel of minimalism divine creatures floating like billowing clouds opening a getaway to the sky A triumph of craftsmanship Brava Pierpaolo

This gorgeous red mini skirt is perfect for your Christmas party or any other party where you re feeling extra Alessandra has quickly become one of my go to designers for flirty feminine chic

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times Especially with its practical and cute packaging you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag Having soft hands is key and never to be neglected boys and girls

Who wouldve ever thought that someone would  actually communicate in our case post from the airspace Sounds extraterrestrial yet this is real human evolution guys I hope next year to speak on this space about finding cures and miracle medicines It will make me so much happier

So here I am on my way back home from Los Angeles having a panic attack  and if Im not Im almost there  not because of the altitude but because Ive realized that I havent talked to you at all about my Burberry trench coat experience at the Landmark Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong the only Mandarin Oriental in the world with a silver fan  the rest of them have gold 

At the beginning of January Ive had the great pleasure to stay at their redesigned and absolutely beautiful suite L900 to experience five Burberry ultra spoiling days The MO Landmark joined forces with the iconic British house and until the end of February all the guests of this suite may wear the heritage Burberry trench coat and enjoy the “My Burberry” fragrance during their stay complementing with an exclusive private in suite styling consultation I totally loved this experience The suite was beyond chic in cool neutrals like white and grey that gave it a contemporary appeal and a mix of vintage modern furniture Not to mention the pal next door who was no other than the Landmark mall one of the best shopping destinations globally

What Need some Hong Kong getaway I totally get it…

Hi Love your look as always I was just wondering which nailcolour your wearing…

http   wwwevdailyblogspotcomI am in love with these light weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you re in but they are all a part of the chance experience

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show Valentino of course  I picked this little S S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held It s sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential When you don t feel like wearing a full face of make up you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face Its also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water PS  Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant


My travelling patterns are much like an espresso short and intense and with a lot of sugar thanks to the host with the most  Michael Kors  Last week I went to Shanghai for the first time ever to celebrate the The Walk event

When I arrived at the Waldorf Astoria not only was I greeted by the most spectacular view of the skyline the MK fam remembered my favourite flower and had beautiful white roses arranged by my bed and a gorgeous goodie bag of course

Before the event we went on an amazing tour of the city and stopped by the majestic Jingan Temple This is what I love about Shanghai the old traditional lives side by side in perfect harmony with the ultra modern The city is dynamic and has something interesting for everyone no matter what youre into

To the The Walk event I was channeling a bit of disco diva and went for a dazzling metallic leopard dress My favourite accessory however was and still is of course the Sofie smartwatch I didnt think I was going to be such a nerd about it but seriously it is so handy and I use it all the time It gives me everything from traffic notifications to message alerts to and most important a great finish to any look Theres no styling trick to it really but if you want  to mix it up a bit wear it over chunky sleeve to accentuate the watch even more

Valentino Rockstud Spike bag  Valentino dress  Valentino tights  Valentino sandals

Photography Haris Farsarakis

Its a new dawn   Its a new day   Its a new life…and were feeling good Mr Pierpaolo Piccioli 

Yes its a new era for my favorite House of magic Valentino under the creative direction of Pierpaolo Piccioli and the depicted Rockstud Spike bag represents the first sign of the Historic Houses new path

And If I can judge from these baby steps into this new world Its gonna be young edgy unconditional and uber cool

For the Rockstud spike bag couture becomes trend thanks to an artisanal quilted technique a scene of studs enlightens its surface as if it being a punk dotting My favorite piece of the bag tho is the handle as its super adjustable a super fun accessory that can be adjusted to you mood and personality

The future looks so bright at Maison Valentino

“A new beginning demands a certain forgetfulness In order to rewrite history one should forget about it and retain the essence moving quickly and irreverently to explore the pleasures of metamorphosis
Actions should be quick guided by taste that edits chooses combines unites  elongating narrowing keeping time as a value on the surface of things; stripping away of the superfluous to add intensity
Eras should be crossed in an accelerated supercut drawing an imaginary line that brings Hieronymus Bosch the visionary inventor of fantastic heavens and hells close to Sandra Rhodes who has been invited to reinterpret the artists imagery with her pure and innocent lines”

That said from Pierpaolo Piccioli on his debut show as the sole creative director of Valentino I wont talk much I will just let you feast your eyes on his breathtaking collection with only one wish…All the new beginnings to be like Pierpaolos  EPIC

The Chanel Fall 2017 couture show was a triumphant celebration of Coco Chanel and the city in which she lived; evident by a scale replica of the Eiffel Tower in the middle of Grand Palais The set design may have filled Instagram feeds today but it was the breath taking collection that filled our hearts with admiration for the Parisian je ne sais quoi and awe for the style that is characteristic of the undisputed fashion capital of the world

Tweeds and leathers dominated the runway today embellished with feathers and finished off with beautiful boater hats The shoes were sublime too all in patent leather in various lengths  Im very very tempted by the knee high ones 

Karl Lagerfeld creates a unique world around each collection and within these worlds live the most exquisite Haute Couture pieces that I am so lucky to experience

Thank you Chanel 


In love with the patent leather boots Both over the knee and the mid high ones look so nice  😍

Love the collection  And those leather boots

The #VLTNTokyo pop up in Shibuya blows EVERY other pop up out of the water Valentino threw the best party in town  KOHH performed need I say more  with the most gorgeous exclusive items such as accessories basket balls and even yoga mats

I was also met by an array of belted pouches and got myself the #FreeRockstudSpike white one which is to die for I usually place these babies over my shoulder when Im wearing a dress and around my waist when wearing low waisted pants

If youre in Tokyo do NOT miss to check out the pop up at the QC CUBE 4 21 8 Jingumae Shibuya ku

One might expect floral patterns and colorful palettes from Resort collections often shown in exotic places; more commercially conscious separates and accessories tend to dominate the line ups

As Pierpaolo Piccioli does he marched to the beat of his own drum and showed a collection that was as fresh as it was modern  free of clichés and full of brilliant new ideas that unfailingly tread the line between romantic and cool

The color blocking was irresistible and my personal favorite was the long sleeved midi dress in red and pink I dont usually wear pink but when I do…

Photography Haris Farsarakis

Creative direction & styling Evangelie Smyrniotaki

For boys and for girls actually for everyone who appreciates the contemporary beauty Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli did it again  without oops  created the perfect imperfection the project name Untitled Inspired by the Japanese technique of the kintsugi that consists in repairing broken ceramic objects with gold powder Maria Grazia and Pierpaolo developed a capsule collection of twelve essentials of our wardrobe from the beige trench to the jeans and the white sneakers only this time the binding component are the studs Yes youve heard it well instead of the familiar to all of us stitching a part of each item has been detached and adjusted using golden studs

When the time came to brainstorm about the concept of this editorial Ive been so moved by the deep meaning of this collection and Ive been continuously keep telling to myself that I had to find an element that connects everything My story with Rockstud Untitleds story a living thread… Water That was it Yes water is inherently a substance that connects everything to everything else and it was just in front of my eyes when in Paris The clumsy me during the last fashion week I almost drowned myself in this fountain after I stepped on my floor length dress Kidding not the danger belongs to the past the future is bright and alongside with Valentino even brighter

Enjoy

So cool

I loved the volume and lack thereof in this collection  some body parts are exposed and some drown in massive ruffles and tulles I found it to be provocative in an unexpected way but expectedly the shoes were on fire as usual Vaccarrello is a master of seduction and showmanship

Love this post 

http   wwwevdailyblogspotcom


Kickstarting a month full of shows with the most spectacular brilliant one that history has written yet
Yes Im well aware of the aforementioned words because in all honesty guys it will be quite hard for anyone to overcome Mirabilia Romae‘s epic proportions
On a personal level since 2011 that Ive started blogging there are times  a lot  that it really feels like living in a dream but cross my heart nothing and I mean NOTHING had prepared me ever for this the goosebumps the emotion and the thrill of watching Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Picciolis Haute Couture astonishing creations marching at Piazza Mignanelli
So wanna take a ride with me Get in our golf cart Yes this was the exact vehicle that took us around to the ten different Mirabilia Romaes spots where Valentinos creations were placed in these “secret” yet magical locations right in the heart of the citys historical part The thing about the past is that we often dont realize how much affects our future until its zoomed in front of us And thats exactly what Maria Grazia and Pierpaolo wanted to show with Valentino‘s pieces displayed in the parts of Rome that inspired their existence It was incredible going through them all a trip to the past that everything made much more sense And my personal favourite…the depicted Casanatense Library with the astonishing Cyclopean globes and an army of line up dolls in the middle of the room  a treasure trove of embroidered ensembles triumphantly standing in the palatial silence

After the historic delight I had to return fast to my hotel and get ready for the show My dress the most beautiful dress Ive ever worn was already in the room hung in its bag I unzipped slowly the bag spending a couple of minutes just staring at it It was so delicate but simultaneously much heavy by its own craftmanship Thousand of perfectly placed stones embellished all over it to tell its story “a summer night under the Roman trees” maybe
As for the show itself allow me to say that Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Picciolis touch gave a life force to the Spanish Steps A stitch in timeThe collection was remarkable balancing gracefully between past present and future A tribute to Romes legacy and a not so silent message for all of us 
THERE ARE TIMES THAT YOU MUST LOOK BACK TO GO FORWARD

I feel so much gratitude for experiencing Mirabilia Romae and I will never ever forget that Ive watched Emperor return to his very own Rome

This must have been one of those jaw dropping shows not only the gorgeous collection but also the back drops to it all Thanks for giving us a glimpse of the beauty
Hugs Adele xoxo

Inspiring strong vision 





The deconstructed pieces oozed legacy however it all came together in a very Galliano way that left an aftertaste of glamour and excellence I think its a easier to slip into banality and recycled ideas when the brands legacy is as strong as Maison Margielas however thanks to Gallianos endless and uncompromising creativity  nothing is ever banal about his shows Instead of living in a legacy Galliano is continuing it the only way he can which is the greatest homage of them all

Well current state of mind is also current state of body VERY rare for me we are honest on this space remember At this moment Im lying on a bed at Maldives next to hubby who seems annoyed by the clicking noise  surrounded by an airy white tulle canopy The canopy is always stuffed into our bed linen a practice I guess for our own safety as the islands ecosystem is massive  If you dont already know it one of my biggest fears is to find a snake below my pillow… Nuts or not Im still checking below it every single day Anyway…This Maldivian island is a paradise A leaving dream And the resort here is just beyond I promise will tell all it in a couple of days

For now…Im just enjoying it

You can salute summer on various ways on the first day of September Some will say goodbye by taking one last dip in the sea while others will try to forget the end of the season by eating a whole tube of ice cream I on the other hand dont want to forget I want to remember the good times and the better ones that are yet to come Being optimistic much One may ask whats better than a breezy summer night Anywhere that love can flourish I would say…Coming back from Maldives a place that gives you the time to find yourself again the one that youve had neglected by working so hard for the past year makes you see things quite differently What I mean about differently Well Its good almost precious to take a step back  dont go with the flow and enjoy what youve accomplished so far Trying for more might come to a dead end and striving for excellence might be an utopia All that matters is feelings and if these airy fringes brought you back for a second to an islands distant shores then on this space there will be always summer

Thailand is one of my favourite countries to visit during the summer even though theres a chance for a bit of rain during this time of the year I love the serenity and peace that one finds near the water and the beautiful sounds of nature in the forest Since it can get hot humid and wet all at the same time its not an easy destination to pack for My tip is to go for white linen pants and wide white shirts that can keep you cool and covered at the same time I like to break the monochrome look with colourful earrings such as the ones from Oscar della Renta Other things I wore during this trip are

My go to brand for style proof beautiful separates is Joseph My love for the British brand is passed down to me from my mother and now its hotter than ever thanks to its never failing coolness

First look at Salle Privée  Its a luxury brand for men created by Patrick Munsters and as you guys know I love dipping my foot in the menswear pool   coats especially as they have that impeccable tailoring cut and oversize feel

Its been a dream of mine to go to Tokyo for a very long time and get to stay at the Andaz Tokyo Hotel made it all the more special A couple of days isnt nearly enough to explore the city and thanks to the beautiful view from my room I could soak up the grandeur of Tokyo and its buzzing life from the comfort of my bed The most notable things however was the impeccable service and delicious food 


Their Spring Summer 2018 collection cemented the brands American cool DNA and there was also a hint of romanticism this time around with silk ribbons florals ruffles and ruched tulle tube dresses perhaps affected by couture atmosphere

Proenza Schouler made a splash in Paris and its ripples are glamorous



What a beautiful collection Proenza Schouler never disappoints

I am in love with these light weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you re in but they are all a part of the chance experience

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential When you don t feel like wearing a full face of make up you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face Its also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water PS  Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant

I m in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what s more perfect than a perfume for every mood These little beauties range from light floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul am I right

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times Especially with its practical and cute packaging you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag Having soft hands is key and never to be neglected boys and girls 

For the summer Im taking cue from Delpozos S S18 show and Im going for the rosy natural make up slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybodys favourite material   straw  Is it summer yet

Battle of ages HOW TO survive a case of a severe blizzard situation without looking like the otherwise lovable hippopotamus that searches for love food at a distant lakeshore

Well on this space we are the fiercest ones and well go with the bomber and layer it We might end up looking like an onion but never like the happy hippo

So when Ive been asked by the dearest Farfetch to select my favorite items from Luisa World for the upcoming season there could be no other than the coolest Valentino bomber with the even cooler gang on its back on the top of my list Its awesome no Ive been eyeing on this since the very moment I saw it on vogues pages three months ago and now tadaaaa in store a proof that times goes by so quickly  I guess in no time there will be summer againDrink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight

This season we will celebrate “the longest the better”  the innocent way How much do I really want to add some naughty emojis over here however the serious notion of this blog puts an X to any scandalous thoughts
 So if you didnt get it already I am talking about long long draped ties Ties longer than the average that add bit rhythmic national team drama to your hands however at the moment you will bend over to rub your dogs ears you can easily trip on them saluting the floors What a woman can do for fashion…great fashion tho

A lot has happened in my life since I last logged in styleheroine Please try to follow me I went to Miami for a private beautiful dinner with Matches Fashion stayed four days there making the most of the beach met my friends and finally spent some quality time away from the fashion weeks on my way back home Ive stayed 14 hours at the airport because the BA planes engine couldnt get fixed I fell hard off the lounges sofa with my plate and the pasta  dropping onto my head I nursed my husband as he got super ill of course I got him well and the last three days Im shooting the new campaign for By Malene Birger Yes life is a roller coaster 2 weeks passing by like 2 minutes and one month like three For what its worth Im taking you back to Paris in a glimpse of an eye What was I saying



Love it

As my favorite look from show oozes careless sophistication and a hint of romance I styled it with the hat from look 11  I love adding a bit of contrast in my looks

Ive said this before and Ill say it again   Gabriela Hearst knows what women want and how they want to feel This chiffon trimmed velvet dress has the perfect cut and fit   it emphasises the right parts and shows just enough to make you feel a queen

I didnt plan for this but when the stars align your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai and voilá   magic happens  Expect nothing less when staying here as the resort is truly magical and unique

Underneath thousands of paillettes lies a silk georgette slip that feels incredibly luxe and smooth in true Miu Miu spirit The spaghetti straps and split on the side are pleasant details and make this the ultimate va va voom piece


The association between gowns and haute couture may still be strong but Valentino keeps blurring the line between evening and day wear proving that that excellence and impeccable craftsmanship is present in whatever Piccioli touches whether thats a simple pleated skirt or hooded cape

Why finding the surreal fit on leather pants is a mental struggle…I bet yall know Leather pants are not much forgiving 

You ate cake last night They are silently judging you However what Ive found  and I KNOW  you trust me  is that the classic shapes are the ones who flatter most And whos the master of classics Yes the iconic Calvin Klein has revived his leather line with the Rebel Edge Limited Edition collection The struggle is over guys  I swear they fit so so good  And because some thoughtful styling is always welcomed the collection has been enriched with the perfect teammates for the leathers which are no other than the simple cotton tops  Like I love 

Enjoy

Raey is actually the newborn of matchesfashioncom I guess their many years of experience in the fashion industry have been proved extremely fruitful because guys I swear on my bloggers honor they are killing it Clean lines combined with the best materials a somehow hard to get match out there You absolutely have to experience their fine cashmere knits If you close your eyes and face the sun they do feel like a spring day in Portofino a perfect escape what fashion should be all about…

Hands up whos up for a ride  Cause If we are gonna build a time machine that would be definitely in a car stolen from Back to the Future 

So back to time and altogether we head to North towards the Vikings ex territory obviously I am also obsessed with these series  and the most beautiful Copenhagen It has been a couple of months ago and the chill season had just started but I could still stroll around the city in my personal favorite outfit from By Malene Birgers Winter 15 collection Straight from the catwalk blending with the grey bricks of the city By Milene ‘s totally relaxed approach to menswear came to prove that yes the Queen of women suits actually exists And apparently is Danish All hail the Danish Queen

Ganni shirt Emilio Pucci shorts via LuisaWorld 

Ph Haris Farsarakis

Still shamelessly Thailanding or for those who are not following my adventures on instagram  by the way WHYperquèpourquoi  Im at my beloved palm tree land watching my toes getting darker and darker every day Might be a fetish but really not because when we have a fetish dont we really know it Like the other day a friend of my mine told me that she has just started a relationship with a double Gemini and I really wanted to grab and save her…

GURL   Why are you doing this to yourself

Yes I have  maybe  a fetish with horoscopes and I cannot hide it With my aforementioned almost bad habit comes also the equally bad tendency to judge people by the dates they are born I mean how many times have you lived the Cancer woman drama or the stubbornness of an AriesBad bid with a Virgo Fall in love with the Aquarius mega mind Join the club

And if you ask for my very own species Im a fish a Pisces with ascendant in Leo born just before the Aries clan begins so much of the aforementioned stubbornness characterises also me In other news our beloved Susan Miller says that today is the luckiest day of the year  Shall we believe her Lets see…

 

I am absolutely in love with this shorts  

minonimiablogspotcom

Shit SAME HERE Im so judgemental when it comes to zodiac signs I had a Gemini friend so I know literally everything about double faces and dual personalities The stubbornness of an Aries Been there done that got the t shirt  but still wear it so  Also Im always like “Dude Im an Aquarius so that automatically makes me smarter than you”  kidding  But seriously Im a bit nervous when my horoscope says “Do not travel today” or even worse “Do not get in the car”…
Im in love with the shorts but really where am I in this constellation wheres the Aquarius  😉
You look stunning as always 

Im a Scorpio 
Those shorts are amazing

I come back in a full sincere apologetic mode because this time its been almost two weeks since my last shout out Its not only that Ive been on vacation but its mostly that styleheroinecom is growing fast and Im just one human being handling everything by my own So its finally time to admit that I need urgently an assistant and maybe the new years resolution should be to find one Go ahead fellas spread the news and most importantly email me And maybe who knows well be together in the future  Sounds romantic yet…its not   

Lets go back to the Oriental side of life and the mesmerizing Hong Kong which unfortunately I have to salute today one of the cities that honestly I could  stay for the rest of my life Ive had this discussion with a friend there and Ive asked her why do some residents keep complaining about living in such a beautiful city Her answer was probably the most obvious one that massive cities like Hong Kong demand never ending working hours and people dont have the time to enjoy the beauty of their surroundings True words yet allow me to say that theres always time to appreciate beauty Dont ever think that things are given and cannot change Everything can change anytime so take five minutes and enjoy the sparkling sky line of this astonishing city a glorious proof of what human minds can achieve

On another style note if there was one piece that could fit any body type that would certainly be the off shoulder I love that comes back in fashion a design almost from medieval ages Wow it would be such a scandal to show some shoulder those  days  Nowadays naaaaah Neither nudity is scandalous anymore Of shoulders are clean broaden shoulders and elongate the neck almost a magic wand in your hands  You need this wand no I certainly do

From hair to waist all sky high everything…

My hair does suffer from some kind of mysterious blonding curse which graciously gifted my scalp with a few new pairs of well groomed cockroachs antennae to sense NYs high vibes YES I wont lie my hair has been broken Almost platinums side effects have eventually showed up When it comes to hair though nothing is irreversible or non fixable as long as I keep in mind my moms biggest beauty secret that is no other than pure olive oil DONT EAT IT at least dont do it before applying it directly to your hair leave for an hour or so and then clean it away only with shampoo at the beginning  and then rinse it with water Before ditching the idea of smelling like a Greek salad just remember that it really works Moms know better been there said that…

In another news my seasonal search for the highest waisted pants has happily ever after ended in NY by finding DAT awesomeness By DAT I mean the depicted Rodarte They are the highest of all the Burj Khalifa of the pants and before you rush to judge me yes thats good The highest the waistline rests above your hips the tallest youll look That simple Just remember…size up on these jeans They are so so tight and on this blog…well we dont want you to suffer…



New York really agrees with you you look so chic   Love the flats and jacket and olive oil did wonder to your hair  
http   wwwpardonmyobsessioncom 

I am getting more and more into high waisted jeans Its true it makes you look taller sitting just below the waistline is perfect  and they are so comfortable  I love the outfit;   You used to be a brunette and now you are a blondie either way when  ones hair is damaged olive oil is the  ultimate solution to restore its shine and health  mommas around the world and styleheroine thanks for the tip

Winter warm up and a trend to watch 2 in 1 for a Monday that I try to remember when was the last time that I wore real clothes Yes I am still barefooted in Maldives wearing nothing than my swimwear We even go sans shoes to diner a habit that I am afraid might cost me one week of my life trying to figure out how I am gonna fit my toes into shoes So this post is something like a missing note to the gloomy dressed up Parisian days and the trends that are yet to come

As someone always in denial of colder times I decided to pull out my Balenciaga F W17 pants in the summeriest color I could get my hands on I also love that they have side stripes that elongate my legs and add a bit of a sporty element to my look Style them with a pair of pumps and pointy toed boots 

Im a sucker for playful proportions all things red and cuddly sweaters   so yeah its safe to say that this oversized Balenciaga turtleneck ticks all boxes and becomes this weeks Crush

As someone who has hyperpigmentation I have to be really careful under the sun   especially in the tropics I obsess with creams sunblock and hats and now I found a product that has been the most efficient to date Chanels  SUBLIMAGE La Protection UV SPF 50 is both potent and delicate which takes the best care of your skin so you can be carefree during your time off 

I usually have super chapped lips so a little trick of mine is to apply a bit of lip balm before the lipstick However even since my lips have gotten acquainted with Coco Rouge they have never felt more hydrated  This new lipstick by Chanel is both nurturing and packed with gorgeous pigment my favourite being number 444 Gabrielle Juicy cherry lips all Summer baby 

The Chanel Fall 17 Haute Couture show left me not only with memories from a beautiful collection it also left behind a marvellous scent   the new Gabrielle Chanel perfume With tones of orange blossom jasmine yilan yilang tuberose and white flowers it smells fresh and modern If elegance were a fragrance it would be the new Gabrielle Chanel and her words do still echo and inspire the Maisons creations "Elegance comes from being as beautiful inside and outside”

Give your nails the best summer treatment and go for Chanel s 562 Coralium polish I m wearing it non stop it s a fab shade and an even more fab mood fixer xx

The highlighter Im obsessing over right now    the Illuminator adds radiance and a beautiful shimmer to your face Just dab a little of the product on the highest point of your cheeks for some extra luminosity and youre ready to face the warmer season

Back and fourth like a ping pong ball we go on this blog But some of us we find it kinda amusing exactly like the aforementioned game So here I am again virtually this time strolling around the city of future I dont really mind the humidity it actually opens up my pores and detoxifies my skin or the 70000 Singapore Dollars needed to obtain the licence to drive your car for ten years yes youve heard well  I WANT Singapore to adopt me  Please do  Ill be a good girl I might start wearing some pink if youll ask it As long I can wake up to this views every single day Singapore is in my heart and every time I come back its always different Better in a way This city celebrates the miracles that humanity can make And we really can Just look around take a deep breath and think tha everything is possible…

We do love great clothes after all thats why were all here But if clothes could speak in common language theyd tell you that they do unconditionally love a fit body and even more a fit mind

My newest collaboration with Net A Porter was a challenge for me A challenge to wake up my body Net A Sporter just on time for the fashion weeks has  launched the 7 day body reboot program per me an absolutely genius program to feel strong like a heroine again You know a couple of weeks ago I was vacationing on the best spot on earth to be uber lazy So Ive returned kinda…disoriented…unfocused…jelly bean for gods sake

Net a porters 7 day body reboot was my rehabilitation  A smart no time consuming training and dietary program that made me feel awake again all of my forgotten muscles Strength mobility intensity and restoration workouts coordinated with the most delicious healthy menu It was not easy…the first two days I was fantasizing myself walking down Jardin des Tuileries wearing hot pants to stay focused Yet trust me this program is genius and your body will eventually remember and master all the moves

Now do tell me…I got my lines back No

Your exclusive guaranteed beautifying schedule is live now on Net A Sporter

You can get my fitness uniform below 


The trainers are amazing and you have definitely inspired me to work out more often   You look great

Wow  You have an amazing body Evangelie  Do you work out a lot Love the top & those trainers are fab  Love how they tie round the ankle Another great collaboration

Hello from the beautiful Dallas and the awesome Reward Style conference Currently enjoying phototosynthezing the Texan sun and utterly motivated to talk about our summers hero pieces and perhaps the winters ones if youll take a look at Isabel Marants newest collection  the striped dresses Who wants a dress to wear everywhere  Raise your hand  Im pretty certain that all hands around this block are already up in the air Your vehicle to drive you unmistakably around the day  or night  is printed… horizontally A refuge for the sleepy morning brain cells which do refuse to decide matchy matchy pieces or dinner outfits Striped dresses are our not so new hero pieces our time savers our chic boosters Woo hoo 


Love that dress almost Missoni like but with that cool Celine touch you look adorable

Emerging designers or else the holly grail Ive got to find Oh yes I remember well the last time Ive mentioned one on this space Its been Demna Gvasalia and Vetements impressed at that point of time my newly acquired sweatshirt Blonde…you had almost forgotten this right I havent…I still remember how good it felt because YAS blondes do have much more fun

Back to the serious talking… Ronald Van Der Kemp has been set my heart on fire The man not only introduced the “demi couture” to me with the incredible craftsmanship of his line imagine that the RDVK pieces are sewn by hand but also reminded me again that extraordinary fashion has to do with extraordinary feelings A line that takes you back to the romantic past when the fashion houses actually cared about making you feel unique and not just a number in the vast mass with their impeccable tailoring and unique sewing Take for example this marinière looks familiarly fab but with a closer look you realize that its uncommonly fab as a mesh serves for the base of the silk panels to be carefully hand stitched and not only cover your tities but also fit like a precious glove Past techniques will light up the future of fashion and Ronald definitely knows this

So pretty  Love this outfit

I really love going out by wearing only a stand out lipstick And by stand out I mean a deep powerful shade a lipstick that stays on the lips and doesn t move around  to your teeth etc  For this season my very favorite shades are from Chanel Rouge Allure Ink They are super super long lasting matte but not dry Depicted you can see my personal loves but also shades that I believe they match with every single skin Enjoy

You ve asked I listenso on "Do it like E" posts we apply my favorite and super easy beauty tricks on different persons Let s get started people with triangles I m always super lazy with my make up and I have invented this way of going out wearing ONLY eyeliner and looking fresh I just draw a small triangle ending exactly at the middle part of my lash line That s it It uplifts my eyes and the whole face  making it look fresh n  sexy in no time Just remember to use the most stable eyeliner to avoid transferring to your upper eyelid My favorite Calligraphie De Chanel n 65 hyperblack The best

The most wanted lips created by Peter Philips with these simple steps  "Apply a beige pencil this makes the lips dryer and erases the natural lip tone that way you don t see the red of the lips underneath Then you smoosh the glitter on clean up the edges with clear tape and finish by pressing a tissue over the mouth" There you have it All shine

Lip liner Charlotte Tilbury

Glitter OCC

A breath of freshness that radiates citrus a sense that brought back all of my restless childhood memories Happiness thats all a perfume is about right

The shooting took place at Hotel Infante Sagres in Porto Portugal
Is it only me or whenever you also touch linen  your biological blaring alarm clock surprisingly does sound like summer If hitting the snooze button for the 10th time is your go to solution to forget sunny days in our case it simply does not work Linen is the rare case of material connected with only one season The aforementioned

And vice versa when Ive been packing for Portugal in the back of my mind I had the tropics and that simultaneously resulted the first thing chosen for my trip… linen  That doesnt necessary means that Ive actually met the tropics…It has been very pleasant weather wise but when the sun  went down well you needed an EXTRA jacket

So how cool guys are the Azulejos or else the Portuguese tiles This post could be a photo gallery dedicated to their art but on an unexpected turn of corner my back the Mega Valentino T did steal the lights And I am not the kind of a girl obsessed with how her back looks Imagine when a hairdresser brings over the mirror to check how the haircut from behind this usually ends up with me hysterically laughing I mean who checks your hair from behind They might check other parts of your body but hair   However there comes the time when good photography reminds me…that back actually matters and in the future my nervous breakdowns should be eliminated only when slicing onions…True story

Ph Haris Farsarakis
The only garment that could support nudity and I mean that even if you are naked inside nobody would actually care Happy first of March lil fellas and what a better way to start this month with a statement jacket probably my favorite pieces of the wardrobe Pieces that remove all the unnecessary brainstorming of what to wear as all they need to be matched with is the maximum simplicity And you must know by now the motto of this blog no Simplicity IS the greatest ability yes yes so far we havent changed here So if a single jacket creates a sense of an absolute need it is the greatest of all A turtleneck a t shirt or a buttoned down can be easily paired with the only required premise to be monochrome Let your statement jacked do the monologue I am sure everybody will love its loud voice


And…just because I adore them below is my top list of the spring statement jackets Enjoy 

Love your style and true fashionista

*Lame λαμέ   shiny fabrics or the excessive use of sequins the Greek way 

Saturday night my favorite day since I have actual memories and that tiny part of the week when my most beloved outfits got out of the closet for a stroll or for a dance marathon If I got lucky And I really loved and still love  to dance have I ever told you that WHEN on the dance floor Ive had the energy of a Duracell bunny and Rihannas moves at the Barbados Carnival Parade Blame it ONLY on my greek genes My  very dancing ones
So this post is for all of you who ask me what to wear during the hottest nights of the week without feeling overdressed
 Wait a minute lady you are all over sequins and you are not feeling over freakin dressed You must be drunk 
Well I am 100 percent alcohol free and I can reassure you that if you wear your most glamorous dress the Holly Grail of your closet your shine bright as a diamond armour yes we listen a lot of Rihanna on this blog  paired with a simple plain black pair of ballerinas then not only you wont feel overdressed but youll also look as chic as one very modern Jackie O And even when it happens to be amongst the super tall Danes like I was for the past few days thats not a bummer you wont be that dwarf youll be the coolest million dollar babe ready who knows how to look beautiful even in loads  and I mean LOADS of sequins

Love this pictures   The dress is super cool

Peter Jensen jumpsuit  Louis Vuitton belt pouch Chloe mules here and here  Linda Farrow sunglasses

Ph Timur Emek

And I really wonder are we the sassy Greeks the only ones in the planet who shamelessly pronounce the belt pouches as BANANAS  I hope not so you my preciosas to be able to link somehow the tittle with the image without speculating that after Milan I just went BANANAS Either way my magic foggy sphere mysteriously predicts that the aforementioned outfit divider obviously thats the cause the depicted belt serves  will be a huge trend The “look mum no hands” expression in a completely different demonstration No bicycle needed

Back in Milans steamy streets just an hour before the Stella McCartney Spring15 presentation dressed in the most comfort way a jumpsuit that is This Italian city doesnt come easy with summer That translates into heat and mosquitoes a terribly nasty combination for sweetblooded girls like me I did saved my hands though from a dot ed disaster yet that did not applied on my legs I still have the marks of Milan on my limbs but I also have another ones those forever kept in my brain cells Memories…

The Stella McCartney Spring15 presentation took place at “Orto Botanico” the botanic gardens as the name implies by the side of Bvlgary hotel From a distance the dramatic entry with Stellas flowered pink letters the long fenced lush plants complex and the scattered candle lights made me think of a countryside party But once I stepped through the last bushes the true “spirit” of the evening showed up McCartneys models impeccably dressed with the designers spring 15 collection cheerfully interacting with the crowd I seriously love this new coolness of presenting collections Its like a refuge from the metal glare of the cities Some precious moments quality if you may to indulge into the fresh collection The outfits themselves were absolutely beautiful McCartneys heroines superheroes was actually this seasons theme were strong yet fragile Feminin yet a bit boyish But above all they were happy happy girls in their clothes absolute comfort As we all should be

Let my paparazzi skills speak for themselves



 

ah those mules are just perfection <3

Makeup & hair Stellar

Im extremely proud to present to you my first capsule collection Ive designed for Tom Wood the originally jewlery mega brand which is now expanding to the clothing industry My favorite Scandis will make their market debut with two lines  The namesake one a men and women minimalistic collection and the Heroine by Tom Wood 10 cleaned lined pieces that were always on the top of my wish list 10 pieces that could be worn in multiple ways yet all destined to make us all feel comfortably confident

So how have they all started…Well in May 2012 Mona Jensen Tom Woods owner and creative director contacted me to design a jewelry line for her then soon to be launched brand I felt really honored but not yet ready to design jewelry However with clothes was another story Its something that probably in my genes From age zero it felt natural to design outfits I had even created my own mini line when I was in high school with a local seamstress It was good Im telling you at least I had totally enjoyed it So when we hooked up again with TW team during the last NY fashion week as we were discussing of how much our fashion aesthetics do match up they popped up the question to me  design my first capsule collection As far as I remember it didnt need that much time to decide I was already a big fan of Tom Woods signet lines and the proposal was dreamy Not  to co design or just put my name on a label To put my whole soul the whole me And Im really so thankful for that So thankful that Mona believed in me and trusted that we both together we could make a miracle happen So here it is the Heroine by Tom Wood a collection of pieces that ALL have a story behind stories that I will reveal one by one in the near future

Black boot Chloe Snake skin boot Isabel Marant Burgundy boot Marni  all via Luisa World 

And god created the medium heel 

Or better one major army of the “in between” feet supports because the medium heeled boots yes my friends are so trending for the upcoming season And it was about time if you ask me In fact Ive always wondered why the four to eight cm were until lately a rare species for the design houses Its been always flat or hight All or nothing However the new medium size adjustment  to the heel gives form to our everyday comfiness and highlights a certain vision of femininity For me our boot to go shouldnt resemble to a basketball players pair of kicks to look cool and feel comfy too It should be this kind of boot that of course it would be majorly walkable yet with an addition that should give to the silhouette a flattering and elegant notion And this addition is no other than this specific MEDIUM heel Our feet will not suffer anymore just to look feminine YAYYYYY…the new seasons must have is made for walking and they simply adore it

Tote Smythson

Ph Alex F Bag close up by me

I must have a packing syndrome I honestly dont know its name yet there must be a word written about it in the psychology glossaries That is when you pack your whole house in the fear of missing something during your vacation Yeap Im a heavy weight traveler Except from one thing through  My bag It is weird but when it comes to bags I try to take one  or maximum two with me  for all circumstances From day to night to the beach or to our evening stroll One hell of a multitasker The “one”  that saved during my recent Southeast Asia trip was the depicted Smythson A white large tote with a wave of canary yellow inside in other words a Kinder surprise And you know how much I love surprises  Seriously

Now hear me out I might not speak that loud during this Malaysian midnight yet Ill try to be clear Theres not any secret for turning the extreme frizzy dehydrated locks into straight ones I adore straight hair  without using a dryer We the hair balls are on another level people The medusa s  level Not any available technological advances are made for us yet To be honest with you I have tried the Brazilian blow dry in the past but from shoulder and below…destruction…chaos…embersdo I need to say more Plus If I havent already told you Im hypochondriac and all these stories about the potential cancer risk had creeped me out Just wear a hat girls It works Oh and straighten a bit your ends It helps when you want to have a nice braid

Enough with the hair talk Still in Malaysia today we had our first burger  Dont dare to judge me about my newscast  Life is pretty easy here Not much dramaWell except from the fact that my stomach is going to explode by the extensive use of Malaysian spices Five days in a row are more than enough for my bodys probably most fragile area my heart is excluded  p   So the Pangkor Laut facilitates five restaurants with my favorite one the Straits a gourmet restaurant to dine in private booths literally on the rocks A bit overpriced if you ask me always judging by the Malaysian currency and the countrys economy Apart from that the food was fab and the location insane 

You know the drill…its latei have to go to sleep or else I might a need a helmet to look descent in the pics tomorrow…Goodnight…

Outfit pics Alex F the rest by me

Two words with a tab in the middle  Recovery mode There must be a pill A pill that instantly vanish your jet lag If it really exists and its not my wild imaginations yet another product  Id like to know it…please 

Thewhole following week we will be all passengers in time when Ill take you back to my then tropical state of mind It was my seventh time in Singapore Seventh I cannot believe that Im actually saying that number or that it has been my 11th anniversary with my husband 11 years together and while for some might seem like a lifetime for me it feels like yesterday Time passes quickly guys But what is really time  I have convinced myself that is just a human invention existing to stress us and put us in “boxes” Can you imagine your life without the significant  existence of the time counter Life as it supposed to be Measured with feelings

I suppose that all being mentioned above are obviously the side effects of my jet lag Anyway back at that day in Singapore and my usual habit to wear jumpsuits Logically youll ask me 

Is nt it too warm to wear in Singapore

May I  answer with a question Have you ever been inside a building in Singapore The cold is insane Its like a local conspiracy to have the A C on the skin preserving mode Zero celsius that is No joke Thus these cotton Current Elliott all in ones were somehow  perfect for the circumstance And while struggling to preserve my body temperature Ive unexpectedly found my number one wish on my fall list It seems that theyd stocked earlier that the other capitals and the Louis Vuitton mono earring was surprising available Available and light weight  Yes    My ears wont suffer for fashion Actually thats partially true because my earring hole was closed in the back and my suffering while attempting to reopen it was insane I had almost forgotten how massive the piercing pain was And I have 10 ear holes I should have known better obviously the 8 of them closed   While the salesman was watching me with terror almost to bend the earring he had the brilliant idea to bring over another pair of studs that could help for a better ear drilling After endless ear poking with a few breaks to pray…well that was it…the studs saved the day…

 

 

 

Congrats on your anniversary with your husband  LOve a good jumpsuit Current Elliott sure makes the best ones so easy and yet not easy to pull it off so beautifully
