I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world. 






The concept of a traveling fashionista wasn’t very hard to see, the models had boarding tags in their hair and on their clothes. The hair and makeup did not go unnoticed, the amazing Eugene Souleiman and the legendary Pat McGrath stood behind the creative and fun looks.

Seeing sneakers at a couture show isn’t something you usually witness, but doing so was refreshing and if someone could pull it off, it would be the great John Galliano.

Beautiful pictures. It is nice to notice the idea behind these dresses; woman in a rush.
Thanks

I LOVE Maison Margiela, you’re so lucky that you’ve been there! Especially John Galliano is a pure genius and he was one of my most fav designers at House of Dior. The work he does for Margiela is amazing and I think they didn’t have a better designer because his creativity is endless.

I can’t begin to try and understand or dissect the work of John Galliano. As a creative being I am in awe of the great work of John Galliano, I’m so glad he’s back !!

Acclaimed for his distinctly glamorous and seductive designs, Peter Dundas’ eponymous label is all about that and some more. His black S/S17 shimmering dress is my favorite piece from his debut collection, and it truly is the perfect LBD to channel you inner diva.

Dare to wear stockings that match your shoes! My monochrome look is complete with these gorgeous coco leather mules by The Row. You can try this look with any color of the rainbow though.

This gorgeous cozy red coat from Common Leisure is Christmas in a garment, so say goodbye to ugly Christmas sweaters and say hello to chic staple pieces that work for the holidays and any other day for that matter! 


I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

This gorgeous red mini-skirt is perfect for your Christmas party or any other party where you're feeling extra. Alessandra has quickly become one of my go-to designers for flirty, feminine, chic.

I chose a pair of gorgeous, red suede pumps with  playful tassels from Aquazzura that I paired with wide high-waisted pants and a cozy over-sized knitted sweater from Joseph.

And for those occasions when you want to channel your inner intergalactic 60’s bombshell these low blue sparkly booties from Pedder Red are perfect.

I also went for these glamourous, sparkly pumps from Jimmy Choo as well. Whether you wear them with wide pants or a cute little number, they’re your go-to party Choo’s (hah!).

Last but not least, I also fell in love with these velvet, emerald green, everyday boots. I feel like velvet isn’t just a fad but here to stay, and boy am I glad it is!

Wow. These pictures are stunning and so high level. You are very classy and creative.

My go-to brand for style-proof, beautiful separates is Joseph. My love for the British brand is passed down to me from my mother, and now it’s hotter than ever thanks to its never failing coolness.

First look at Salle Privée! It’s a luxury brand for men created by Patrick Munsters and as you guys know I love dipping my foot in the menswear pool - coats especially as they have that impeccable tailoring, cut and oversize feel.

It’s been a dream of mine to go to Tokyo for a very long time, and get to stay at the Andaz Tokyo Hotel made it all the more special. A couple of days isn’t nearly enough to explore the city and thanks to the beautiful view from my room, I could soak up the grandeur of Tokyo and it’s buzzing life from the comfort of my bed. The most notable things however was the impeccable service and delicious food!


Spending severals days in the slopes of the French Alps was a dream even for me, not by any means a professional skier (surprise surprise). This ski trip was no ordinary ski-trip though – usually you enjoy the snowy slopes on them but I got to experience the mountains from ABOVE. We went on private helicopter ride and soaked in the breathtaking view of the majestic mountain tops.

Net-A-Porter is the definitely the host with the most surprises, events, atmosphere, love and last but not least – with the best wardrobe for every occasion.

Check out my winter essentials below!

Chic and warm snow booties by Chloé

Punk leather ankle boots by The Row

My travelling patterns are much like an espresso, short and intense and with a lot of sugar thanks to the host with the most – Michael Kors! Last week I went to Shanghai for the first time ever, to celebrate the The Walk event.

When I arrived at the Waldorf Astoria, not only was I greeted by the most spectacular view of the skyline, the MK fam remembered my favourite flower and had beautiful white roses arranged by my bed and a gorgeous goodie bag of course.

Before the event, we went on an amazing tour of the city and stopped by the majestic Jing’an Temple. This is what I love about Shanghai, the old, traditional lives side by side in perfect harmony with the ultra modern. The city is dynamic and has something interesting for everyone, no matter what you’re into.

To the The Walk event I was channeling a bit of disco diva, and went for a dazzling metallic leopard dress. My favourite accessory however was, and still is of course, the Sofie smartwatch. I didn’t think I was going to be such a nerd about it but seriously, it is so handy and I use it all the time. It gives me everything from traffic notifications, to message alerts to, and most important, a great finish to any look. There’s no styling trick to it really, but if you want  to mix it up a bit, wear it over chunky sleeve to accentuate the watch even more!

Beautiful!

I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again - Gabriela Hearst knows what women want and how they want to feel. This chiffon-trimmed velvet dress has the perfect cut and fit - it emphasises the right parts and shows just enough to make you feel a queen.

Underneath thousands of paillettes lies a silk-georgette slip that feels incredibly luxe and smooth, in true Miu Miu spirit. The spaghetti straps and split on the side are pleasant details and make this the ultimate va-va-voom piece.

Crushing on crushing the Labor day rule and wearing white pants at the Chanel S/S18 show in Paris! No one does black and white like Karl Lagerfeld, making the classic feel exciting again.

Known firstly for creating it-perfumes, now Byredo-founder Ben Gorham presents his new it-bags. Just like his scents, the Seema handle bags are minimal: simple in shape and surprising in level of comfort. Gorham breaks new ground and strikes gold.

The #VLTNTokyo pop-up in Shibuya blows EVERY other pop-up out of the water. Valentino threw the best party in town (KOHH performed, need I say more?) with the most gorgeous exclusive items such as accessories, basket balls and even yoga mats.

I was also met by an array of belted pouches and got myself the #FreeRockstudSpike white one which is to die for. I usually place these babies over my shoulder when I’m wearing a dress and around my waist when wearing low-waisted pants.

If you’re in Tokyo, do NOT miss to check out the pop-up at the QC CUBE, 4-21-8 Jingumae Shibuya-ku.

Wow! Beautiful!

Pierpaolo you are the fresh air out there, yet already a legend!

As someone always in denial of colder times, I decided to pull out my Balenciaga F/W17 pants in the summeriest color I could get my hands on. I also love that they have side stripes that elongate my legs and add a bit of a sporty element to my look. Style them with a pair of pumps and pointy-toed boots!

I’m a sucker for playful proportions, all things red and cuddly sweaters - so yeah, it’s safe to say that this oversized Balenciaga turtleneck ticks all boxes and becomes this week’s Crush!

Ever wondered who my all-time favourite designer is? Check out my candid Q&A with Farfetch where I give tips on off-duty styles, reveal wardrobe secrets and my best buys.


On-theme, many of the tweed jackets and dresses were covered in clear hoods, ponchos and coats – including gorgeous plastic boots and bags. Plastic is making quite the comeback and will definitely make a splash next season.

This was such a perfect way to finish Paris Fashion Week – talk about saving the best for last!

I was absolutely in love with this Chanel show! The environment and the clothes, absolutely breathtaking.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.


Galliano strikes a chic balance between the dramatic and wearable – and the result is fun to watch and incredible to wear.

LOVED IT!

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world. 






I loved the volume and lack thereof in this collection – some body parts are exposed and some drown in massive ruffles and tulles. I found it to be provocative in an unexpected way, but expectedly the shoes were on fire as usual. Vaccarrello is a master of seduction and showmanship.

Evangelie this is such a beautiful review! I am an up coming Greek fashion blogger and you are what I aspire to become and achieve in this industry. If you could take some time and check out my blog http://www.portraitdelamode.com or Instagram (@portraitdelamode) it would be such an honor. I do reviews too! I love you so much 😘😘 Keep up the amazing work you do! It would be an honor to collaborate with you in any way.

Your photography for your photos are absolutely stunning! I love your silk dress in the second to last photo with the gold chain. The chain really is the perfect touch, simple and elegant. That dress would look great with a pair of gold hoop earrings as an extra accessory and a pair of Celine rounded sunglasses.  https://www.lensntrends.com

Great!

The magic rests in the textiles of the pieces and subtle details, such as the satin ropes that held together the silk gowns. The collection was sublime – take my word for it.

Absolutely amazing!

What I love about Delpozo collections in particular is that the concept runs through all looks, and entire looks – head to toe, making every detail worth our attention. My favorite looks were with the playful, bicolored tulles and head pieces.

Thank you Josep for the splash of fun and beauty during New York Fashion Week!

I admire his work! Well written article as well!

Love the collection! Especially the colours used in the designs <3

I’ve always been a fan of straw bags, ever since I used to take my grandmother’s picnic bags to accessories to rediscovering them a couple of years back. This season I’m love with Rosie Assoulin’s interpretation of the straw bag and how, even just its shape, takes me back to Greece and leaves me feeling all warm and nostalgic inside.

Bangkok is one of my favourite cities - its raw energy is like nothing else in the world. I try to come here at least once a year to clear my head, which is funny given the chaotic and hectic pace of the city. The temperature acts like a yo-yo and it’s always humid so I tend to wear short skirts, loose-fitting trousers and sweatshirts here. I’m in love with this new jersey top from a stellar Russian brand called Walk of Shame. And it’s shamelessly cool, don’t you think?

As someone who has hyperpigmentation, I have to be really careful under the sun - especially in the tropics. I obsess with creams, sunblock and hats, and now I found a product that has been the most efficient to date. Chanel’s  SUBLIMAGE La Protection UV SPF 50 is both potent and delicate, which takes the best care of your skin so you can be carefree during your time off!

Seneca once said, if one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable and this is the reason why I love Phoebe Philo’s Céline so much. She has such an inspiring vision and clear direction, noticeable in everything from trend-setting silhouettes to chic details. Check out the placement of the zippers on these Pre Fall 17 boots. To die for!

Thailand is one of my favourite countries to visit during the summer, even though there’s a chance for a bit of rain during this time of the year. I love the serenity and peace that one finds near the water, and the beautiful sounds of nature in the forest. Since it can get hot, humid and wet all at the same time, it’s not an easy destination to pack for. My tip is to go for white linen pants and wide white shirts, that can keep you cool and covered at the same time. I like to break the monochrome look with colourful earrings, such as the ones from Oscar della Renta. Other things I wore during this trip are: 

Straw bag by Rosie Assoulin,

Black and orange swimming suit by Eres, 

White dress by Solace London, 

White top by Zimmermann, and Prefall Celine pants.

I usually have super chapped lips so a little trick of mine is to apply a bit of lip balm before the lipstick. However, even since my lips have gotten acquainted with Coco Rouge, they have never felt more hydrated! This new lipstick by Chanel is both nurturing and packed with gorgeous pigment, my favourite being number 444 Gabrielle. Juicy cherry lips all Summer baby!

I wouldn’t call it being Big in Japan just yet, but being featured in Vogue Japan’s September issue is a BIG deal for me! The magazine has always stood for avant-gardism and fresh new takes on fashion, and for its September issue I got to show my favorite F/W17 pieces. In this particular photo I’m wearing look 55 from the Fall Winter 2017 Valentino show, a stunning silk gown that gives me the best beach bod wouldn’t you say?

You can tell Karla Colette has been designing most of her life - her understanding of the female form and how women want to feel in swimwear has made her the go-to beach brand for stylish women around the world. My favourite piece right now is the black velvet Victoria swimsuit - fit for a queen.

It was weeks ago since I saw the Monique Lhuillier show in Paris but her S/S18 collection sure did leave an imprint. I think about her creations often when I have an occasion I need to get dressed for, her trademark hyper-feminine evening wear. Her last show was a treat of chiffon, ostrich feathers and lace in soft and delicate colors. There’s so much strength in standing your ground and showing fairy tale-inspired pieces in a current environment that seems to appreciate anything but.

Shocker! I went for the shoes again! Of course I’ll get to Zimmermann’s etherial, beautiful and sexy RTW pieces from Resort 18 too, but I just had to have these kitten-heel sandals first. I’m in love with them because they have the straps placed at all the right places and they have a walkable heel that makes them a dream to walk in, and a dream to look at.

The Chanel Fall 17 Haute Couture show left me not only with memories from a beautiful collection, it also left behind a marvellous scent - the new Gabrielle Chanel perfume. With tones of orange blossom, jasmine, yilan yilang, tuberose and white flowers, it smells fresh and modern. If elegance were a fragrance it would be the new Gabrielle Chanel, and her words do still echo and inspire the Maison’s creations, "Elegance comes from being as beautiful inside and outside.”.




As my favorite look from show oozes careless sophistication and a hint of romance, I styled it with the hat from look 11 – I love adding a bit of contrast in my looks.

 

Yee-haw!

I never quite understand how you create such movement in your shots while still remaining to look motionless! You’re a true artist and what a perfect collaboration you and Haris are !

Here I am on my way to the Vetements show in Paris, ready-to-go and mentally prepared to expect the unexpected. Demna Gvasalia chose to present his S/S18 collection by hanging up life-size photographs (shot by himself) of Vetements-clad Zürchers, in front of the bank, super market and local floral shop. This fashion-show-turned-press-party was a refreshing break from the conventional pace and as always, Demna creates a lot of anticipation and lives up to it with brilliant collections.

The Chanel Fall 2017 couture show was a triumphant celebration of Coco Chanel and the city in which she lived; evident by a scale replica of the Eiffel Tower in the middle of Grand Palais. The set design may have filled Instagram feeds today, but it was the breath-taking collection that filled our hearts with admiration for the Parisian je-ne-sais-quoi and awe for the style that is characteristic of the undisputed fashion capital of the world.

Tweeds and leathers dominated the runway today, embellished with feathers and finished off with beautiful boater hats. The shoes were sublime too, all in patent leather in various lengths (I’m very, very tempted by the knee-high ones).

Karl Lagerfeld creates a unique world around each collection and within these worlds live the most exquisite Haute Couture pieces that I am so lucky to experience.

Thank you Chanel!


In love with the patent leather boots. Both over the knee and the mid high ones look so nice! 😍

Love the collection! And those leather boots!

LA-based Michelle Mason’s take on this season’s hottest hue is sublime as she contrasts the seductive red against the simple and beautifully cut slip that sits oh-so smoothly against the body. This dress has the power to make any one who wears it feel like Wonder Woman.

As the famous saying goes; when life gives you lemons, you make a funny face only when wearing the hottest Brioni sunglasses. Add an extra edge to your look and don't shy away from borrowing from the boys this season, whether it's eyewear or shirts.

‘Tis the season – that lovely time of the year when the Prefall collections drop and all the pieces we’ve been longing for all summer make an appearance in stores. As far as tradition goes, I ordered my favorite Céline shoes from the collection… The asymmetrical Pirate sandal in black, with the hand painted snakeskin heel that both makes a statement and is super comfortable for the wearer.  I’m wearing these babies with my trusted satin and lace Valentino dress.






The deconstructed pieces oozed legacy however it all came together in a very Galliano way that left an aftertaste of glamour and excellence. I think it’s a easier to slip into banality and recycled ideas when the brand’s legacy is as strong as Maison Margiela’s, however thanks to Galliano’s endless and uncompromising creativity – nothing is ever banal about his shows. Instead of living in a legacy, Galliano is continuing it the only way he can, which is the greatest homage of them all.

 





The association between gowns and haute couture may still be strong but Valentino keeps blurring the line between evening and day wear, proving that that excellence and impeccable craftsmanship is present in whatever Piccioli touches, whether that’s a simple pleated skirt or hooded cape.

Hi Evangelie,

Valentino has become, no doubt, my favourite designer. He understands sensuality in a very elegant way. 

Lots of love

Beautiful collection, indeed.

 


Their Spring Summer 2018 collection cemented the brand’s American-cool DNA and there was also a hint of romanticism this time around with silk ribbons, florals, ruffles and ruched tulle tube dresses, perhaps affected by couture atmosphere.

Proenza Schouler made a splash in Paris and its ripples are glamorous.

What a beautiful collection. Proenza Schouler never disappoints.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

French jeweler Charlotte Chesnais is making some of my favorite accessories at the moment – her pieces exude sensuality and simplicity with a twist. Her earrings, rings and necklaces embrace the wearer in unique ways and really stand out. I fell in love with this beautiful, golden hair slip that I either tuck in a tousled updo or wear with my hair down. It adds an effortless touch of sophistication and definitely makes it onto my Essentials list.

Give your nails the best summer treatment and go for Chanel's 562 Coralium polish. I'm wearing it non-stop, it's a fab shade and an even more fab mood-fixer. xx

The highlighter I’m obsessing over right now  - the Illuminator adds radiance and a beautiful shimmer to your face. Just dab a little of the product on the highest point of your cheeks for some extra luminosity and you’re ready to face the warmer season.

Beautifully crafted with raffia and suede, The Row’s Bindle bag is one big slouchy dream that compliments any off-duty look. I would either go monochrome or match this creamy Bindle with any other color from a neutral palette. Less is more… stylish.

One might expect floral patterns and colorful palettes from Resort collections, often shown in exotic places; more commercially conscious separates and accessories tend to dominate the line-ups.

As Pierpaolo Piccioli does, he marched to the beat of his own drum and showed a collection that was as fresh as it was modern – free of clichés and full of brilliant new ideas that unfailingly tread the line between romantic and cool.

The color blocking was irresistible, and my personal favorite was the long-sleeved, midi-dress in red and pink. I don’t usually wear pink but when I do…


great pictures

One of the biggest trends of the season is the flower pattern. A pattern that is pretty flattering as flowers add a lot of femiminity to your usual style. Here we have selected the best piece of this trend for you... what else Balenciaga!

In honour of Prada's cruise collection that will be shown today in Milan, my feet have just wore Miuccia's most celebrational feathers. In fact one of my favourite heels for the season.

Your style-heroines are back with a dress to kill.

When I closed my eyes I could almost hear the olive leaves rustling in an August summer breeze at the temple of Poseidon. I could stay there the whole night watching the full moon rising above the bay…

The unexpected moments in fashion that touch your heart, these exact moments that make you feel extremely proud.

Thank you Karl Lagerfeld for still believing (and creating) in the real, timeless beauty right in the age of numbers. And thank you for making me feel like I am at home in the middle of Paris. My home is your home and this is our ideal Greece.

Stunning! Absolutely love it!

It's been a long time since we actually saw a new genre of the denim family. Lemme introduce you to the ruffle bottoms or else the big sister of bell bottoms. More dramatic and more girly but in a way we all want...

Hands down, Marni has one of the best accessories-line outhere and boy this season's earrings are too good. As I'm more into round and bulky shapes lately, these ones are my favorite. Extra bonus, they are super light so this time style comes with no pain.


I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world. 


I feel it's safe to say, swimwear are amazing when they make you feel so confident like you were dressed up into the chicest outfit. That realizations and even more came to my brain cells after a week with Marysia, or else my bomb Maldivian attires. To make a long story short when you still feel great after exposing your body to your worst enemy, the camera, well that's a hell of swimwear.

Marysia Palm Springs Bikini

If I've had these extra, future-telling powers and my fortune sphere did operate well, then I would say that these slides from The Row would be the hit of the summer that everybody will want but nobody will find since they will sell-out. However I am not a witch...or am I?

The Row Capri Metallic Slides

To be completely honest is not our original idea as we firstly saw it on YSL's most recent catwalk. And it's no secret that our biggest source of inspiration are the catwalks. So stack up your earrings people no matter their size. Actually the bigger, the better. :)

Our favorite Aussie did it again with her recently launched denim line that got us falling in love all over with the statement jeans, or else the pieces which get you dressy in no time. My current obsession the Monroe, the middle one, the high-rise slim to die for.


With one of the hottest tickets in the world of fashion I have the honor to magically teleport you to Pierpaolo Piccoli's incredibly beautiful world, the world of Valentino. Maison Valentino's SS17 Haute Couture show was not just another Haute-Couture moment but a dream skillfully translated into reality. Actually, it is Pierpaolo's dream, the sole creative director of the house, who artfully orchestrated a very modern fairytale whose significance will be remembered for years. Not only because he feasted our senses with the goose bumping intensity of the exclusive musical score by the great Master Alexandre Desplat but also because he just gave to fashion the biggest lesson: That simplicity is the greatest ability. Graceful shapes and cuts, sculpted pleats, chiffon braids, delicate hand stitched frills, a marvel of minimalism, divine creatures floating like billowing clouds, opening a getaway to the sky. A triumph of craftsmanship. Brava Pierpaolo.

All the pictures are great and awesome. Loving the collection of dresses. Priceless!

“Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There’s nothing you can’t do
Now you’re in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York, New York, New York”

Good morning from the frozen yet glorious Big Apple for Pierpaolo Piccioli’s first Pre Fall collection for Valentino. It’s the first Pre Fall collection that it will also have a catwalk  show and no need to tell how excited I am to see what amazingness he holds for us.

Go PP, go Valentino.

Love this collection! Looking forward to the flower prints and embroidery/applique on the streets.
http://www.styleme.green

I also wrote an editorial on this, as well as one on their former creative director – Maria Grazia Chiuri – who is now at Dior. Both collections were fabulous

http://www.aryachic.com/christian-dior-pre-fall-2017-review

This collection is phenomenal, I see the consistent repetition of florals throughout the collection, can’t wait for florals to be a major trend in 2017. Love your blog heaps, I was wondering if maybe you could help me out and answer a few questions, related to fashion blogging?
Thank you,

OMG! so cool. I love everything Valentino!

They say never going back yet sometimes it's really nice to look in the past to decide for the future. And what have I seen from my very own and very recent past? Oh gosh so many hairstyles. I'm joking, 2016 has been full of color, quite different for my usual style don't you think? As for the future of my locks? Destiny unknown.

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to you all from you little puffy (and of course white) snowflake. Big kiss. E

I really love going out by wearing only a stand-out lipstick. And by stand-out I mean a deep powerful shade, a lipstick that stays on the lips and doesn't move around (to your teeth etc). For this season my very favorite shades are from Chanel Rouge Allure Ink. They are super, super long lasting, matte but not dry. Depicted you can see my personal loves but also shades that I believe they match with every single skin. Enjoy.

Y'all know my soft spot for the A.W.A.K.E. 's latest voluminous collection. Now you can find them on sale and if you're my girls I am sure you won't resist. What I wear on this image is actually my very favorite from the sale matched with another sale delight, this cuff from Etro.

"Clever" which is actually clever because on this space one quote that we love much is the epic "Look MA no hands". The belt-bags from Vanessa Seward are this winter's eye candies and the easiest goodies-keepers you'll ever have. I personally love to wear them super high over jumpsuits. Easy n'cool.

I've been to a places I couldn't possibly imagine, I've felt emotions that I can't even describe. India is beyond everything I've ever seen. Thank you Jimmy Choo for making me part of your digital campaign for the second year.

My clan, stayed together for the whole night all clad in our chic yet comfy Thakoon sleepwear, having most probably one of the best nights of my life. A lot of champagne, a lot of laughter and A LOT of gossiping. I have missed them so much….Oh I forgot, let me introduce you properly. Please meet Mara and Lydia. My girls.

 

In partnership with Thakoon.

You've asked I listen...so on "Do it like E" posts we apply my favorite and super easy beauty tricks on different persons. Let's get started people with triangles. I'm always super lazy with my make-up and I have invented this way of going out wearing ONLY eyeliner and looking fresh. I just draw a small triangle ending exactly at the middle part of my lash line. That's it. It uplifts my eyes(and the whole face) making it look fresh n' sexy in no-time. Just remember to use the most stable eyeliner to avoid transferring to your upper eyelid. My favorite Calligraphie De Chanel n. 65 hyperblack. The best.

When party season is on, usually the back-side goes off. Who doesn't love an open-back top with the chicest spaghetti straps for the festive season? If it's accompanied by a generous dose of sequins like the Altuzarra's mermaid-y one even better. Let the music play people!

From Singapore to India, to Paris, to Berlin and now back to Athens. My life has been a whirlwind lately plus a new space that went live almost two months ago. But I just wanted to drop a not-so-short line and say to all of you that it’s still my pen here and everything that I completely adore. From my braincells with love that is but in a new synchronous way, an inspirational magazine, a place that prioritizes the followers and not the clicks or the numbers. Thus on the new styleheroine.com you won’t see a labyrinth of pages and windows. Everything is on the home page, crystal clear and very friendly to your sanity. So I really wanted to drop a hello, to ask you how do you find my new me and that yes editorials will be back on track not because I’ve missed my voice, my high-pitched voice is still here but because I have missed yours. Now shoot me, tell all.

How many love letters have you sent to the darest of all Santas? For me it's been always shoe-letters, dear Santa point-toe this, sky-heel that. This year he visited me early with the coolest satin sparklers. Kitten heels to die-for from J.W Anderson.

Calvins....except from the word kings, what else does it come to mind? Well to mine, it's definitely the fact that they are the ONLY underwear you are allowed to flash and still look cool, the Coolest if I may. And that comes from a person that has never before showed her undies to the public yet still feels sooooo good! Only in my Calvins.

I've got it in Paris and I wore it with from hot pants, to skinny jeans, to slip-dresses, non-stop. Not to mention that it is surprisingly warm. Honestly one of the best buys of the season. Fashion|Evangelie Smyrniotaki, Photography|

I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world. 






Happy Thanksgiving everyone. We are so grateful to our beloved ones and to y'all people for supporting us and for making our old dreams come true. Our favorite designers and blings are of course on the thankful-for list.

I guess you don't want everyone to have the same heels as you during the Holiday season, do you? Switch them around with the variations that are killing it for this season. Black satin sparkler, precious metallics or amber suedes. One for each day.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

Think early mornings at Taj Mahal, think afternoon tea by Oberoi's swimming pool, think late dinner under the moonlight, this gorgeous Nina Ricci dress, cracked all the dressing codes and got me from day to night.  With a pair of Jimmy Choo slides or sky high sandals this dress is just perfect.

It might look like a muted shade but omg, trust me, wear this and you'll look anything but pale.  You'll radiate, good mood, retro mood.

Finding new designers to love is one of the most inspiring parts of my job. I'm currently obsessing over Benedetta Bruzziches for the best of the best leathers she is using for her bags as well for her exceptional designs, with my favorite this one, the dreamy half-moon.

Imagine one bare-foot week and snorkeling among a wild selection of coral just on the doorstep of your villa. Bonus...the best mochi in the world at the ZEN restaurant. Dreams actually exist.

I always choose pieces that will take me from the morning and beyond. Take for example this Blazé wool-crepe blazer bought on purpose oversized to make the coolest jacket in the morning and the hottest dress for the night. Timeless for real.

The most wanted lips created by Peter Philips with these simple steps: "Apply a beige pencil, this makes the lips dryer and erases the natural lip tone, that way you don't see the red of the lips underneath. Then you smoosh the glitter on, clean up the edges with clear tape, and finish by pressing a tissue over the mouth." There you have it. All shine.

Sleeves have become the protagonists lately, elevating the otherwise staple shirts into statement pieces. My favorite right now comes in this cloudy pink, it's from their SS collection and you can make it yours in a couple of month. Worth waiting.

A breath of freshness that radiates citrus, a sense that brought back all of my restless childhood memories. Happiness... that’s all a perfume is about right?

Seriously obsessing over By Malene’s jewelry line but these earrings just blew my mind. Shot by, backstage at the brand’s SS17 show, a constant reminder that next summer’s jewelry is seriously hot. Below you can find it’s current version and…

A pair that I could honestly wear for 20 years if I wasn’t so clumsy with my shoes. White color is an universal match and although they are sky-high they are surprisingly comfy. Could I really ask for more?

With its own white-sand beach and surrounded by 5 spectacular forests, the Sarojin is the place that enables you to relax, unwind and recharge. Having one of the best guest services that I’ve ever witnessed, Sarojin is the ideal destination in Thailand. I’ll definitely be back.

If you’ve dreamt of having swimmer’s body, Demna Gvasalia might have just listened your thoughts. The standout piece of this season is a reworked classic with padded shoulders. I love to wear it tucked into high-waisted denim for a more feminine feel.
“A new beginning demands a certain forgetfulness. In order to rewrite history one should forget about it and retain the essence, moving quickly and irreverently to explore the pleasures of metamorphosis.
Actions should be quick, guided by taste that edits, chooses, combines, unites: elongating, narrowing, keeping time as a value on the surface of things; stripping away of the superfluous to add intensity.
Eras should be crossed in an accelerated supercut, drawing an imaginary line that brings Hieronymus Bosch, the visionary inventor of fantastic heavens and hells, close to Sandra Rhodes, who has been invited to reinterpret the artist’s imagery with her pure and innocent lines.”

That said from Pierpaolo Piccioli on his debut show as the sole creative director of Valentino. I won’t talk much, I will just let you feast your eyes on his breathtaking collection with only one wish….All the new beginnings to be like Pierpaolo’s: EPIC.

Impecable,la caida y los cortes son un sueño
Me guata el juego de los colores

Why finding the surreal fit on leather pants is a mental struggle?…I bet y’all know. Leather pants are not much forgiving. 

You ate cake last night? They are silently judging you. However what I’ve found (and I KNOW  you trust me) is that the classic shapes are the ones who flatter most. And who’s the master of classics? Yes the iconic Calvin Klein has revived his leather line with the Rebel Edge Limited Edition collection. The struggle is over guys! I swear they fit so so good! And because some thoughtful styling is always welcomed, the collection has been enriched with the perfect teammates for the leathers, which are no other than the simple cotton tops.  Like? I love!

Enjoy!

love those shoes!

You can salute summer on various ways on the first day of September. Some will say goodbye by taking one last dip in the sea while others will try to forget the end of the season by eating a whole tube of ice cream. I, on the other hand, don’t want to forget, I want to remember, the good times and the better ones that are yet to come. Being optimistic much? One may ask what’s better than a breezy summer night? Anywhere that love can flourish I would say…Coming back from Maldives, a place that gives you the time to find yourself again, the one that you’ve had neglected by working so hard for the past year, makes you see things quite differently. What I mean about differently? Well It’s good, almost precious, to take a step back , don’t go with the flow and enjoy what you’ve accomplished so far. Trying for more might come to a dead-end and striving for excellence might be an utopia. All that matters is feelings and if these airy fringes brought you back for a second to an island’s distant shores, then on this space there will be always summer.

such  a cute dress!

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it.

Well current state of mind is also current state of body. VERY rare for me, we are honest on this space, remember? At this moment I’m lying on a bed at Maldives, next to hubby(who seems annoyed by the clicking noise), surrounded by an airy white tulle canopy. The canopy is always stuffed into our bed linen, a practice I guess for our own safety as the island’s ecosystem is massive.  If you don’t already know it, one of my biggest fears is to find a snake below my pillow… Nuts or not I’m still checking below it every single day. Anyway…This Maldivian island is a paradise. A leaving dream. And the resort here is just beyond. I promise will tell all it in a couple of days.

For now…I’m just enjoying it.

 

This picture is awesome. I love your site, really nice to read

Sweet tooth and ruffled details, I’d say it’s the best hangover cure, you’ll say I’m nuts!
Back from NY with a suitcase full of happiness, if happiness could fit in a rectangular box. Styleheroine.com has been awarded as the best photography blog in the world and I’m still with head in the clouds. Breath in breath out and a second post is coming up, a thankful note for giving me so much joy….

love that blouse!

Winter warm up and a trend to watch. 2 in 1 for a Monday that I try to remember when was the last time that I wore real clothes. Yes I am still barefooted in Maldives, wearing nothing than my swimwear. We even go sans shoes to diner, a habit that I am afraid might cost me one week of my life, trying to figure out how I am gonna fit my toes into shoes. So this post is something like a missing note to the gloomy dressed-up Parisian days and the trends that are yet to come.

Nice looking outfit..

It’s a new dawn / It’s a new day / It’s a new life…and we’re feeling good Mr Pierpaolo Piccioli!

Yes it’s a new era for my favorite House of magic Valentino under the creative direction of Pierpaolo Piccioli and the depicted Rockstud Spike bag, represents the first sign of the Historic House’s new path.

And If I can judge from these baby steps into this new world, It’s gonna be young, edgy, unconditional and uber cool.

For the Rockstud spike bag couture becomes trend thanks to an artisanal quilted technique a scene of studs enlightens its surface as if it being a punk dotting. My favorite piece of the bag tho is the handle as it’s super adjustable, a super fun accessory that can be adjusted to you mood and personality.

The future looks so bright at Maison Valentino.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

If there’s only one thing to buy for this fall then these boots will definitely mirror your face everytime you stare at the floors. Obsessed or not, I AM, with Demna Gvasalia’s new perspective, I’m sure there’s no way not to love these pretty badass yet so walkable booties. Saved and glammed up, party feet in action.

Gorgeous! and also interesting look

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Lately in Mykonos my life is totally under these visors. You have to admit it though, the convertibles of the hats might easily give you a sunstroke however they are the chicest way to watch the funky islanders. Eyes (almost) wide shut and behavioral observation. Oh and some Rose… a whispering one for my friends in LA that already miss so much. You probably don’t understand a thing…or you do?

If you think about it,  A.W.A.K.E brand has been created by Natalia Alaverdian just after a year I have started working on this space, thus you can’t call it actually new. However if a piece of cloth makes you wanna go pole-swirling in the middle of the street, at rush hour, then that might meaning something about this brand. So meet the not only emerging but skyrocketing  A.W.A.K.E. Enjoy!

Hello I am so glad I found your site, I really found you by accident, while I

A lot has happened in my life since I last logged in styleheroine. Please try to follow me, I went to Miami for a private, beautiful dinner with Matches Fashion, stayed four days there making the most of the beach, met my friends and finally spent some quality time away from the fashion weeks, on my way back home I’ve stayed 14 hours at the airport because the BA plane’s engine couldn’t get fixed, I fell hard off the lounge’s sofa with my plate(and the pasta) dropping onto my head, I nursed my husband as he got super ill, of course I got him well and the last three days I’m shooting the new campaign for By Malene Birger. Yes life is a roller coaster, 2 weeks passing by like 2 minutes and one month like three. For what it’s worth I’m taking you back to Paris in a glimpse of an eye. What was I saying?

Love it!!!

Emerging designers, or else the holly grail I’ve got to find. Oh yes I remember well the last time I’ve mentioned one on this space. It’s been Demna Gvasalia and Vetements, impressed at that point of time my newly acquired sweatshirt. Blonde…you had almost forgotten this right? I haven’t…I still remember how good it felt because YAS blondes do have much more fun.

Back to the serious talking… Ronald Van Der Kemp has been set my heart on fire. The man not only introduced the “demi-couture” to me with the incredible craftsmanship of his line, imagine that the RDVK pieces are sewn by hand but also reminded me again that extraordinary fashion has to do with extraordinary feelings. A line that takes you back to the romantic past, when the fashion houses actually cared about making you feel unique and not just a number in the vast mass with their impeccable tailoring and unique sewing. Take for example this marinière, looks familiarly fab but with a closer look you realize that it’s uncommonly fab as a mesh serves for the base of the silk panels to be carefully hand-stitched and not only cover your tities but also fit like a precious glove. Past techniques will light up the future of fashion and Ronald definitely knows this.

So pretty! Love this outfit

Beach ready-essential tips to avoid depression risk… That could be an alternative title of the editorial however I prefer to jump into the main point and simply depict both of THE tips in every single image: Choose a swimwear with great fit and flattering patterns. It would be impossible to share just one piece from the most fresh collaboration between The Outnet and the British fashion designer Matthew Williamson, the man who knows best colors and patterns. Let’s be honest guys, it’s so tough to find a great suit, utterly hatefully. The good news is that the Matthew Williamson x The Outnet ones have the best structure thus they will make you look as good as you can. And because I know that there is trust between us, I reassure you that The-girl-on-the-Coppertone-ad-days belong to the past as long as collaborations like these do happen….LOVE, love everything!

This season we will celebrate “the longest the better” -the innocent way. How much do I really want to add some naughty emojis over here, however the serious notion of this blog puts an X to any scandalous thoughts.
 So if you didn’t get it already I am talking about long, long draped ties. Ties, longer than the average that add bit rhythmic-national-team drama to your hands however at the moment you will bend over to rub your dog’s ears you can easily trip on them saluting the floors. What a woman can do for fashion….great fashion tho.

What really makes an IT bag? When it stands out from a cactus pear overpopulation then here you have IT.
I’m joking guys however if my instincts still work well what remains solid true from the previous sentence is that the J.W.Anderson Pierce bag will indeed be the newest universal LOVE. On 19th May MATCHESFASHION.COM exclusively launched this bag as part of its Digital Trunk Show hub and gave the chance to some of lucky ones to experience Anderson’s awesome piercing first, before the rest of the world. Let me say this, the bag itself is the coolest brown bag I’ve seen lately and almost the coolest pierced person (yes you’ve heard well I treat my bags humanely, we also have dialogue some times) I’ve met this year. And cool beings shall always stay in our lives. Even under an avalanche of cactuses.

Tadaaaaa, your girl, your very best friend from 2011 is the proud face of the newly released digital campaign of By Malene Birger. It’s not my first campaign however this one will be forever treasured in my heart as it’s the first one also produced by us as a creative studio. Yes the depicted images have been shot solely under our Greek sun.  A series of images inspired by By Malene Birger’s calm power. Simple lines, soft light and colors for the woman who radiates confidence and security in her BMB pieces. And that was exactly my direction behind the campaign, true feelings, for true clothes. I hope you like it.

I hadn’t realized how much you’ve missing my pen-writing till now. Thank you all so much for the heartfelt emails. The truth is that I always prefer to talk via images, they have so much to tell by their own and I considered my writing poor compared to the strength of a picture however since you’ve been continuously asking for my come back that simultaneously means that I must be doing something good…
 So back to back to my….back and my surprise hair-bow. To be honest the shirt, it’s actually one of the best blouses I’ve even worn, helped by itself for the depicted most fresh hair-do as it’s neck ties begin back in the middle of the collar instead of the front per usual.  I tied both of the ties in a generous bow as they are super long and…voila! Isn’t it cool? Plus no strings attached around neck, well  you know what it means right? Free movements and endless hair flips. And If you are really my girls…you like this.

beautiful shirt!

For boys and for girls, actually for everyone who appreciates the contemporary beauty, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli did it again (without oops) created the perfect, imperfection, the project name Untitled. Inspired by the Japanese technique of the kintsugi, that consists in repairing broken ceramic objects with gold powder Maria Grazia and Pierpaolo developed a capsule collection of twelve essentials of our wardrobe, from the beige trench to the jeans and the white sneakers only this time the binding component are the studs. Yes you’ve heard it well, instead of the familiar to all of us stitching, a part of each item has been detached and adjusted using golden studs.

When the time came to brainstorm about the concept of this editorial, I’ve been so moved by the deep meaning of this collection and I’ve been continuously keep telling to myself that I had to find an element that connects everything. My story with Rockstud Untitled’s story, a living thread…. Water. That was it. Yes water is inherently a substance that connects everything to everything else and it was just in front of my eyes when in Paris. The clumsy me during the last fashion week I almost drowned myself in this fountain after I stepped on my floor-length dress. Kidding-not, the danger belongs to the past, the future is bright and alongside with Valentino, even brighter.

Enjoy.

So cool!

Such a gorgeous coat!

Hermes and Krokus were close friends. In other words, besties. Hermes an immortal God, Krokus a common mortal like us. Hermes was, like all of the Greek Gods, very athletic and one day while practicing discus throwing he accidentally killed Krokus. Hermes was devastated. How on earth had that happened? Gods never make mistakes. Thus, he decided to turn the lifeless body of his friend into a purple flower and his blood into three red stigmas in the heart of it. Krokus was now immortal, forever living in the land of Gods, Greece.
Who doesn’t love a good story… So, the time has come to share my experience of harvesting the saffron for Korres and their Golden Krocus Ageless Saffron Elixir Serum, in Kozani, Northern Greece (or the pure gold of the Greek land as it’s called). By the way did you know that Cleopatra used Saffron in her daily beauty routine? I didn’t… but I have done my research. I actually always investigate ingredients before using products!
So back to last autumn when I was flown to Kozani by Korres to collect the stigmas, the very heart of Krocus, with the locals. According to studies the beneficial properties Krocus are endless. Among them, it is one of the strongest natural antioxidants which neutralizes free radicals, helps control heart rate and blood pressure, is a strong antiseptic and last but not least it has been proven that it helps to preventing cancer. Korres is the first skincare company to use saffron after years and years of research and trials, as saffron is one of the most sensitive flowers that needed an extremely delicate approach in order to be used as a beauty elixir. A small parenthesis: prior to my trip to Kozani I’ve had the honor to visit Korres labs to witness the actual production of this precious elixir. Korres is one of the few companies that uphold pharmaceutical standards. Even the water used for their products is checked three times per day from 20 different sample points, an equation that serves the highest safety standards on planet. Needless to say, their beauty labs look liked taken from a futuristic movie set. 

Returning to the endless purple fields of Kozani, meeting and greeting some of the sweetest harvesting crue, local families that cultivate Krocus from generation to generation. I’m extremely proud as a Greek when Greek companies support local families in their ventures and Korres is 100% one of them. We even had the pleasure to visit a house in the village to collect the stigma from the flowers meeting the sweetest grandmothers with the most glowing skins if that says something… maybe it was this realization by Korres that gave birth to this miracle elixir? I should have asked but what i know for sure though, a couple of weeks since I’ve been using Korres, everybody seems to have noticed the difference on my skin and is asking me… What’s my secret?

So beautiful! I am sold and will definitely try it out 🙂 Can I also ask where your jeans and jacket is from? xx

Thank you. The jeans are from Vanessa Seward and the jacket vintage Prada.xx

Very interesting article! The products must be excellent, as all the Korres products. Very good promotion of the Greek products!

This product looks amazing!
Love,

I had this discussion with my friend about confidence and she told me that she realized the more comfy she feels the more confident she is. WHOA. So many bells did ring with me…of so many lost years. At the time I was 19 years old and I’ve been continuously wearing pairs of sky scrapers. One day I’ve been walking really fast and didn’t pay attention to the public utilities grate thing on the ground and my heels got stuck. My body started to lean like the Pisa tower and then boom….it felt like a fell of a ladder.

Bruises:1 confidence:0
Yeap I’ve been hanging around with the tallest girlfriend clan, all volleyball players and I didn’t want to be the shortest of all…It took me some years and a lot of uncommon foot problems to understand that there are not friendly high-heels and confidence is not something that heights can give. On the contrary comfort feels good. And when you feel good it makes you confident and when you are confident you smile, chat, dance, have a blast, no matter your height. Simple mathematics.

I love this top shirt

I couldn’t agree more, now I’m all about the wearable heels and other cuts that I can actually breath in. Another great post.

This look is utter perfection! I love that it is so minimal and how you kept it casual with a great pair of dark washed jeans.  The mom jean style looks amazing on you, and this white top looks really good with the blue.  Plus, those flared sleeves are amazing! Perfect look

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?

Milo means “apple” in Greek. 

The nightmare of my childhood years  became the star of my editorial. How times change… The fact is that I loved apple pies yet I hated eating apples. And I’ve been really tired of my mom chasing me with a fork around the house and a slice of this crunchy, nasty fruit on its end. Crunch, crunch, crunch. Yikes! I would only eat them with a lot of honey and cinnamon. Like another cake I guess.  How about you? It’s good to know it’s not just me…. Luckily enough I like Macs and Iphones. Only Steve Jobs created the best Apple ever!!!

Haha! I hate eating raw apples too, they taste so …cheap (if that makes any sense) . I thought it was just me! 🙂        XXX   https://chasingthewhiterabbitblog.com/

I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

I don’t consider myself as one of those notorious beauty experts but let’s be honest girls,  in the world of makeup and skin care nobody is considered completely an expert as there is not one universal skin type. However I love to speak for my very own experiences, when I try new makeup collections or skin care, I, a woman with reactive, sensitive skin, with enlarged pores that occasionally suffers from severe allergies.

When it comes to makeup Chanel is one of the brands that my skin swears on for years.  So when the new collections hit the stores, all of my beauty cells well, cheer up!

The newly launched S16 collection is a fresh, joyful color pallet that captivates the alluring essence of the Spring . I’m absolutely sold on the Sunkiss Ribbon blush. I don’t usually use it as a blush to highlight my cheekbones as they are already enhanced by mother nature and sometime I feel I look weird when I try to contour them but I sweep it over my entire face, delivering the depicted healthy (and always wanted) glow. For foundation I use Les Beiges no 20 (my favorite lately) that I also use as a concealer, yes you heard it well, I find remarkable how it beautifully brightens up my dark circles. However I’m one of the lucky ones who don’t suffer of severe undereye situation so I suggest for those who do, to try this foundation under your eyes but also apply your concealer only toward the edges.

Last but not least I’ve surprised myself with the vibrant Fervent Blue eyeliner, yes for the first time ever I’ve tried blue color on eyes and the verdict…it’s a genius styling trick that I’ve never actually though about it. It can elevate your monochromes in zero time. A very, very welcomed spring surprise.

Yesss, finally beauty post and it’s the best of the best! Colorful, fresh, very “spring”… I’ve really been waiting for it. And this Chanel collection looks so juicy! Thank you for another inspiring beauty editorial:)

Awwww I’m glad you liked it Isabel.

The everlasting question during my interviews is what fashion means to me. Well fashion or style for me is a mood fixer. A psychotropic pill to my soul with no side effects. So every time fashion’s mega minds try to over-analyze industry’s trends, designers’ brand-hopping etc…I would suggest to just let them do their beautiful work, to provide to us what they’re supposed to…happiness.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?

I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it.

Dress and over-the-knee boots Valentino. From the House’s Pre-Fall 16 collection.
Photography.

While exploring Paris with Haris, aweee I made a rhyme and without an effort, these images were shot right after witnessing Valentino’s Autumn Winter sartorial  wonderland. If someone falls in love with her eyes then I was certainly under the spell of the best(and most emotional) collection I’ve ever seen. You can feel and simply enjoy the moment here.

So gorgeous and chic! The dress is amazing

These photos are stunning! The dress is beautiful. So chic! xx

I had this discussion with my husband this evening of how much I enjoy silence. In our case I don’t… I don’t enjoy being silent for such a long time and most importantly I don’t enjoy my blog being down for the past 9 days. Up and down, up and down. Please accept my sincere apologies for this. We are working hard to find a solution for this problem and trust me we will do. Why this happens? You will the first to know when I will be 100% sure about it.

In any case life is a balance, when something bad happens, something better will come on your way to bring back harmony. And the best is yet to come.

You absolutely KILLED this look! I have been such a huge fan of pinstripes, as a matter of fact, my latest look on my blog has to do with them.  What a coincidence! I love that ribbed sweater with the addition of gloves.  Plus the casual look of your sneakers make for a very chic look.  Love!

Love a good wi-fi connection on plane.

Who would’ve ever thought that someone would  actually communicate, in our case post, from the airspace. Sounds extraterrestrial yet this is real human evolution guys. I hope next year to speak on this space about finding cures and miracle medicines. It will make me so much happier.

So here I am on my way back home from Los Angeles, having a panic attack (and if I’m not I’m almost there), not because of the altitude but because I’ve realized that I haven’t talked to you at all about my Burberry trench coat experience at the Landmark Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong the only Mandarin Oriental in the world with a silver fan (the rest of them have gold).

At the beginning of January I’ve had the great pleasure to stay at their redesigned and absolutely beautiful suite L900 to experience five Burberry-ultra-spoiling days. The MO Landmark joined forces with the iconic British house and until the end of February all the guests of this suite may wear the heritage Burberry trench coat and enjoy the “My Burberry” fragrance during their stay, complementing with an exclusive private in-suite styling consultation. I totally loved this experience. The suite was beyond chic in cool neutrals, like white and grey, that gave it a contemporary appeal and a mix of vintage-modern furniture. Not to mention the pal next door who was no other than the Landmark mall, one of the best shopping destinations globally.

What? Need some Hong Kong getaway? I totally get it….

Hi, Love your look as always. I was just wondering which nailcolour your wearing…

Thanks a lot

The Burberry trench is such a classic I adore. The hotel suite looks gorgeous, it must have been a wonderful visit.

Battle of ages. HOW-TO survive a case of a severe blizzard situation without looking like the otherwise lovable hippopotamus that searches for love food at a distant lakeshore.

Well on this space, we are the fiercest ones, and we’ll go with the bomber and layer it. We might end-up looking like an onion but never like the happy hippo.

So when I’ve been asked by the dearest Farfetch to select my favorite items from Luisa World for the upcoming season, there could be no-other than the coolest Valentino bomber with the even cooler gang on its back, on the top of my list. It’s awesome no? I’ve been eyeing on this since the very moment I saw it on vogue’s pages three months ago and now tadaaaa in store, a proof that times goes by so quickly! I guess in no-time there will be summer again..Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight
Are you with me, are you with me?

I’m so with you on this piece Evangelie, it’s stunning & looks gorgeous on you. Really pleased bombers are back on trend.

I come back in a full, sincere, apologetic mode because this time it’s been almost two weeks since my last shout out. It’s not only that I’ve been on vacation but it’s mostly that styleheroine.com is growing fast and I’m just one human being handling everything by my own. So it’s finally time to admit that I need urgently an assistant and maybe the new year’s resolution should be to find one. Go ahead fellas, spread the news and most importantly email me. And maybe, who knows, we’ll be together in the future.  Sounds romantic yet…it’s not!  

Let’s go back to the Oriental side of life and the mesmerizing Hong Kong which unfortunately I have to salute today, one of the cities that honestly I could  stay for the rest of my life. I’ve had this discussion with a friend there and I’ve asked her why do some residents keep complaining about living in such a beautiful city. Her answer was probably the most obvious one, that massive cities like Hong Kong demand never-ending working hours and people don’t have the time to enjoy the beauty of their surroundings. True words yet allow me to say that there’s always time to appreciate beauty. Don’t ever think that things are given and cannot change. Everything can change anytime so take five minutes and enjoy the sparkling sky line of this astonishing city, a glorious proof of what human minds can achieve.

On another-style note if there was one piece that could fit any body type that would certainly be the off-shoulder. I love that comes back in fashion a design almost from medieval ages. Wow, it would be such a scandal to show some shoulder those  days.  Nowadays naaaaah. Neither nudity is scandalous anymore. Of-shoulders are clean, broaden shoulders and elongate the neck almost a magic wand in your hands.  You need this wand no? I certainly do.

Amazing pictures, love it! x

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.Ph

Starting from top:
Gucci Marmont textured-leather shoulder bag/ Jo Malone red roses bath oil/ Gucci Arielle embellished patent leather pumps/ Jimmy Choo Alfie Musk Soft Smooth and Soft Calf Leather Tote bag/ Jo Malone Mimosa & Cardamon candle/ Jimmy Choo Lockett Petite/ Jimmy Choo Viola sandals

At the end of each month I will collect my very favorite items, the ones that nothing can separate me, in super fun and for your eyes only, creative edits. So here we are, starting from today, under the light of a nasty (per all astrologers) full moon, the small pieces of me that clearly possessed my whole month. Enjoy.

such a great idea to take pictures!

Love,
http://www.thestyleventure.com

This is such a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of other monthly favourite posts out there. Beautifully styled. I love Jo Malone, Pomegranate Noir is my favourite!
Hugs Adele xoxo

Beautiful photos, very moody..I guess it’s because of the full moon;) And these pieces are everything! I like the idea, now I’ll be excited at the end of each month to see your fave items and another amazing editorials.. Haris is a master. You both are!

It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

You can find all the items in the depicted looks at Bergdorf Goodman’s Holiday Edit.

Dressed in stunning gowns at NY’s hidden gem, the beautiful(with maybe the greatest rooms I’ve ever seen)  Baccarat Hotel, I’m inviting you all to join me on a journey of pure sparkle and absolute NYC glamour, in an edit that will actually be quite a surprise for many of you. However I really don’t wanna spoil the surprise,  so meet me in BG‘s full-of-obsessions pages, wearing  nine gowns exclusively for Bergdorf Goodman to kick off the Holiday season together.

Edit by me.

The photo shoot took place at Cervo Zermatt

In this photo effects tutorial, learn how to easily blend with the environment. No, I’m just kidding guys, the background-blend-mode wasn’t on at that point of time. Not to even mention that I’m so bad at tutorials. SO terribly bad that actually makes me wonder when I’ll become a mom how I’m gonna teach my child(yes the future teller has predicted only one child for me, not that I’m complaining though) but I guess by then all biological alarms are gonna be ON alongside with the auto-pilot.

It was an accident. The shameless sync with the environment didn’t happen on purpose and I guess J.W. Anderson didn’t have in mind Zermatt’s slopes when designed this sweater. But then I  you can never actually know and at the end all that matters is what you see. So here is the one and only truth:

I’m an Alpine Chameleon. This is it. A very rare one…

On October 21, an astrologically great date if you ask me, there was a fresh, bloomy air on Gucci.com. The site of my personal – literally endless – wishlist has been revamped and relaunched to become a new and inspiring online space. The brilliant imagery onsite really helps convey Alessandro Michele’s creative vision for his collections, a world “full of beauty”. Since Michele was appointed as the new creative director of Gucci earlier this year, I’ve so eagerly desired to visually convey all of my feelings about his creations, which have not only revived the legendary house but also the whole fashion community.

This editorial is a celebration of the new gucci.com and a chance to show you all that for me, Alessandro Michele is not only a brilliant designer, he is also a magician. He can put stitches in time. In Gucci’s parallel universe, old and new, future and past simply don’t matter. It’s all about emotions, individuality and a sensible confusion that hovers somewhere between dreams and reality. And there, exactly at this state of mind I invite you all to join me….Enjoy!

I am in love with the flair, movement, and drama of these photos. Beautiful work!

Valentino jacket/Levis denim/Valentino bag
Ph
Ever since I got these Levis back in NY, I’ve really wanted to write a novel about the truth and lies of purchasing a vintage denim. You know, all the stuff no one says. Here’s one to start you off: You CANNOT buy them online. Don’t even dare. Vintage Levis buying resembles to treasure hunting. None is similar and it’s incredible hard to find the right fit. I must have tried on 20 pairs of jeans that yes, they did “fit” but didn’t flatter. As for the rest of them, they we just too shaggy. Vintage clothing have defects and the effect of defects on their value is completely opposite to the common logic. The more shredded, torn, bleached etc the more freakin expensive they are. And yes, here we go to our next point, real vintage Levis are so costly. Their price-range starts from 250$ to 500$. Quite an investment if you think that It’s actually used clothing. Last but not least after two hours of wearing them your pipi hearts. The pursuit of cheekiness has its own costs so don’t be surprised if an unexpected and kinda unpleasant feeling hits your lower part of your body in the middle of a gossiping/tea session with your girlfriends.

great info! Thanks for sharing!!

Did you know that Toblerone mountain actually exists? Before you rush to the conclusion that I might want to judge your knowledge skills, I will step forward to admit that I, personally, didn’t know it at all! Yeah I always sucked on Geography yet I loved any kind of chocolate, I still do (and to be completely real-time-sync with you, at the moment I’m actually chewing one piece of gianduja) so when I faced the depicted universal temple of cravings and absolute beauty last week in Zermatt, Switzerland, was one of these days, that made me believe that if the Toblerone mountain is real then somewhere somehow Willy Wonka is still waiting for me, to test my self-control next to his hot chocolate river. Enough with my non-stop cravings and let’s go back to Zermatt, this beautiful village right in the heart of the Swiss Alps where I’ve had the honor to participate alongside with another 7 bloggers in a dreamy photo shoot for Jimmy Choo’s newest collection, the Moonlight. The above stills are from day one, when I wore this lethal perfection for the uber photographer Candice Lake, whom I’m a big big fan, dressed in a pale yellowish silk robe, lying on a bed. What? You can’t wait to see the results? Me too!

The perfect little tea picnic in the English country: The picnic takes place near the shore, under a colorful canvas of tents. The breeze coming in from the ocean blending with the warmth of the shadows on the skin…As we are ready to hang up our shoes and play in the sand a gentle wind comes from the sea that makes us wanna snuggle into our checked tweedy coats.

Is it really what Phoebe Philo had in mind when designing her new SS16 collection? I have the feeling that we’ll never know what was in the artist’s head however my brain cells have been exactly at this state of dream during the whole Celine SS16  show, so far my favorite one from Philo. It wasn’t only the need to have the red Chelsea boots that has been haunting me since that day  but also to obtain all of her silk lingerie dresses and camisoles. That recognizable effect of the alluring mingle of the super masculine and the romantic feminine. Celine’s SS16 collection is my ideal way of dressing in a perfect world and I promise you guys if you come a lil bit closer to your screens, I’M SURE, you’ll feel it too.

Oops Phoebe did it again….

Some FABULOUS boots! I also love the checked & lace designs.

If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world. Right hand:

During New York fashion week I had the opportunity to work on something quite far from the ordinary with an iconic brand that I truly, wholeheartedly admired for all of my life, a brand that defines elegance like only a few in the world can do. This is none other than Tiffany & Co.

I love jewelry, however I’m very, very picky with it, to my own surprise even more than I am with fashion. I want every piece to feel strong, cool and most importantly to be so uncomplicated in its uniqueness that I could even sleep in it. Difficult? Not at all. To my own delight, Atlas collection has just the right balance of all these characteristics and even more: It also combines a sense of elegance and power, forces that you can only see joined in New York.

So this is our ultimate journey to discover Atlas collection’s real spirit through my eyes and my heart and I refer to my heart because this part of the City is my favorite neighborhood on earth and my very own memory bubble. I really hope this editorial to make you feel like you were there with me, on a rainy day in my beloved NY, feeling strong and more like myself than ever.

Stunning photos! Lovely jewelry!

In free translation: tarantula is the female character of spidey, or our beloved spiderman. Common you must all know by now that women are much more lethal than Marvel’s super hero/insect. If you don’t then you have come from another planet. Maybe Krypton?!

So here I am at the Celine show,  surviving the Parisian fashion week by using my super-hero(ine) powers and my HERO jacket. Maison Valentino got absolutely playful and this spring will cut the ribbon of a new extraordinary line, the(obviously) Hero collection. The Italian house has created the most exciting line to add some extra special powers to your wardrobe: The powers to turn you into the hottest girl around the block and not only. No joke guys this jacket is fantastic. Comic references, joyful colors and absolutely insane craftmanship: small leather pieces invisibly connected with each other to create one smashing armor.

Take note girls and next spring let’s get all powered by Valentino.

That jacket is just so cool! You look stunning!

When it comes to new collections’ presentations in NY, the productions are so incredible that could be their very own campaign-sets. That has been exactly the case also at Theory’s SS16 showing where my photographer’s, Haris, absolutely talented lens caught the most magical moments of the presentation. Dots, stripes and Theory’s always fantastic suits, everything under the glowing New York’s skies. Enjoy!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

FOHH:Fear Of High Heels

One post that could be no other than celebrating the end of the fashion week in flats and denim. Yes the New York Fashion Week is officially over, bitter-sweet end, if you will. My exhausted part pops-up champagnes yet my fashion instincts are kinda of depressed. New York this time has been a wonderful experience for me as I’ve had the honor to be the ambassador of L’Officiel Italia for the whole week. All beautiful things come to end…or not? Stay tuned.

This outfit is amazing. The pieces are basic, but have such a unique twist! And those slingback heels are gorgeous…

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

Hello style heroines. Your favorite station blog is transmitting live from New York with a shout-out from the past and more specifically from six moths ago. Such a complicated personality….I know…But as I’ve told you in my previous post ” sometimes is good to look back to go forward”.

The Big Apple for me this the time is an actual delight as there are huge projects coming up that I’m extremely proud of….Stay tuned!

PS: Now that I’ve reminded you my last April’s blonde locks, how do you prefer me better? I haven’t heard a word from you!

Love the androgynous vibe to this look. I think you suit a brunette more, although blonde looks great on you. What I’m loving is your fringe in your most recent post of NYC, it really suits you.
Hugs Adele xoxo

You look adorable. The high-waisted pants add a timeless touch to the outfit and the suspenders really spice it up. I love suspenders and feel so comfortable when I wear them.
I prefer the blonde hair color.

Oh là là, this black and white is perfect on you !!!

http://www.pardonmyobsession.com/

Another amazing post! I love this outfit – and as for your hair, I prefer it dark I think! But I am a dark hair kinda gal, I also loved the bangs and you inspired me to get some cut in a while ago. I have since grown then out AND cut my hair into a bob because everything was getting a little too high maintenance! 

Shot From The Street | Fashion Blog

I’m super happy for you and your projects, it’s really amazing to watch your journey through all these years. Wish you luck with everything what’s coming up for you and can’t wait to see it!

Oh, about hair.. You look awesome as a blonde and I’m pretty sure you would rock even a pink mohawk (not quite sure about pink though), but personally my favorite look is brunette with bangs. I feel like bangs adds a bit of nonchalance and character, if you know what I mean. It just really suits you:)

You’re fortunate to be able to carry off both looks beautifully, but I prefer brunette. It’s a sophisticated and striking look for you.

I m afraid i agree with your mom….  brunette!

Emerging designers…does this category truly represent designers like Vanessa Seward, who has designed before for houses like Chanel, Azzaro and A.P.C. Atelier de Production et de Création (their latest collaboration actually carried her name)? And if your über consciousness says a big fat NO, then how would you describe an already established creator who only recently makes her own line?
Well sometimes categorizations are not that important than the collections themselves. Vanessa Seward is the designer that I’ve instantly fell in love while I’ve stumbled upon her in the pages of Harpers Bazaar US. She represents all I’ve aimed for and even more when I looked up my style heroines like Lauren Hutton. A nostalgic without feeling whimsical collection of refined, chic staples and denims from luxurious Japanese stretch cotton, denims which can actually get embroidered on their back with your first name in her own boutiques.
I really have to say this guys, Vanessa Seward is a pure heroine by herself and I promise you my (for now) one and only piece from her winter collection very soon will have…siblings…

You can find some of my favourite pieces of Vanessa Sewards’s recent collection below. Enjoy!

Fall’s statement skirts are first in almost every single alphabet and made for all the body shapes. Women I’ve found your doc! Joking…Statuesque or (maybe not) the iconic A-line high-waisted skirt is a shameless limb-elongator, almost one Marvel superhero. Sexy enough without feeling too obvious a perfect balance between strength and femininity. With A-line skirts, the lower part of the body stays in focus, positive focus, so I would suggest to avoid loud shout-outs from the upper part.

-Hey there, you above, STAY QUIET!

A simple masculine shirt or a plain sweater would make the perfect yet muted buddy. Maybe my favourite skirts of the upcoming season.

You can shop my best picks from A-line skirts below. Enjoy.

Kickstarting a month full of shows with the most spectacular, brilliant one, that history has written yet.
Yes I’m well aware of the aforementioned words because in all honesty guys, it will be quite hard for anyone to overcome Mirabilia Romae‘s epic proportions.
On a personal level, since 2011 that I’ve started blogging, there are times (a lot) that it really feels like living in a dream but cross my heart, nothing and I mean NOTHING had prepared me ever for this, the goosebumps, the emotion and the thrill of watching Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli’s Haute Couture astonishing creations marching at Piazza Mignanelli.
So wanna take a ride with me? Get in our golf cart. Yes, this was the exact vehicle that took us around to the ten different Mirabilia Romae’s spots, where Valentino’s creations were placed in these “secret” yet magical locations right in the heart of the city’s historical part. The thing about the past is that we often don’t realize how much affects our future until it’s zoomed in front of us. And that’s exactly what Maria Grazia and Pierpaolo wanted to show with Valentino‘s pieces displayed in the parts of Rome that inspired their existence. It was incredible going through them all, a trip to the past that everything made much more sense. And my personal favourite…the depicted Casanatense Library with the astonishing Cyclopean globes and an army of line-up dolls in the middle of the room , a treasure-trove of embroidered ensembles triumphantly standing in the palatial silence.

After the historic delight I had to return fast to my hotel and get ready for the show. My dress, the most beautiful dress I’ve ever worn was already in the room, hung in its bag. I unzipped slowly the bag spending a couple of minutes just staring at it. It was so delicate but simultaneously much heavy by its own craftmanship. Thousand of perfectly placed stones, embellished all-over it to tell its story, “a summer night under the Roman trees”, maybe?
As for the show itself, allow me to say, that Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli’s touch gave a life force to the Spanish Steps. A stitch in time.The collection was remarkable, balancing gracefully between past, present and future. A tribute to Rome’s legacy and a not-so-silent message for all of us:
THERE ARE TIMES THAT YOU MUST LOOK BACK TO GO FORWARD.

I feel so much gratitude for experiencing Mirabilia Romae and I will never, ever forget that I’ve watched Emperor return to his very own Rome.

This must have been one of those jaw dropping shows, not only the gorgeous collection, but also the back drops to it all. Thanks for giving us a glimpse of the beauty.
Hugs Adele xoxo

It was until only recently, more specifically during the Fall-2015 shows, that Yves Saint Laurent’s very popular in the 60s pussy bow got revamped. Can you also hear the cheers of joy right from my neckline? YAS! Eveck* is popping up the champagnes. I really hated the not so-long-ago situation. There was TOO MUCH going on under my chin and not very flattering for my face, for everyone’s face if I may. Now that the thin delicate tie has succeeded the previous season’s almost brain-washing big fluffiness, the shape is more classically confident making you feel strong and safe in your own clothing. No more gift-warped silhouettes but a genuine simplicity underlying your natural beauty.

Still shamelessly Thailanding or for those who are not following my adventures on instagram( by the way, WHY?,perquè,pourquoi) I’m at my beloved palm-tree-land watching my toes getting darker and darker every day. Might be a fetish, but really not because when we have a fetish don’t we really know it? Like the other day a friend of my mine told me that she has just started a relationship with a double Gemini and I really wanted to grab and save her…

GURL!! Why are you doing this to yourself?

Yes I have (maybe) a fetish with horoscopes and I cannot hide it. With my aforementioned almost bad habit comes also the equally bad tendency to judge people by the dates they are born. I mean how many times have you lived the Cancer-woman drama or the stubbornness of an Aries?Bad-bid with a Virgo? Fall in love with the Aquarius’ mega-mind? Join the club.

And if you ask for my very own species I’m a fish, a Pisces, with ascendant in Leo, born just before the Aries clan begins so much of the aforementioned stubbornness characterises also me. In other news our beloved Susan Miller says that today is the luckiest day of the year! Shall we believe her? Let’s see…

 

I am absolutely in love with this shorts! 

minonimia.blogspot.com

Shit, SAME HERE. I’m so judgemental when it comes to zodiac signs.. I had a Gemini friend so I know literally everything about double faces and dual personalities. The stubbornness of an Aries? Been there, done that, got the t-shirt (but still wear it, so..). Also I’m always like “Dude, I’m an Aquarius, so that automatically makes me smarter than you” (kidding). But seriously, I’m a bit nervous when my horoscope says “Do not travel today” or even worse “Do not get in the car”…
I’m in love with the shorts, but really, where am I in this constellation, where’s the Aquarius?! 😉
You look stunning as always!

I’m a Scorpio!
Those shorts are amazing.

And god created the medium heel!

Or better one major army of the “in-between” feet-supports because the medium heeled boots, yes my friends are so trending for the upcoming season. And it was about time if you ask me. In fact I’ve always wondered why the four-to-eight-cm were until lately a rare species for the design houses. It’s been always flat or hight. All or nothing. However the new medium size adjustment  to the heel gives form to our everyday comfiness and highlights a certain vision of femininity. For me our boot-to-go shouldn’t resemble to a basketball player’s pair of kicks to look cool and feel comfy too. It should be this kind of boot that of course it would be majorly walkable yet with an addition that should give to the silhouette a flattering and elegant notion. And this addition is no other than this specific MEDIUM heel. Our feet will not suffer anymore just to look feminine YAYYYYY….the new season’s must have is made for walking and they simply adore it.

I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

You can find the Balenciaga “Navy” line for Mykonos at Freeshop Mykonos.
In the blue we love!
So what’s up guys? Long time no see. I KNOW, it’s terribly annoying but on the other hand I’m sure that you are happy for me, especially when I combine work with vacation, a match made in heaven if I may. I presume you do follow me on Instagram (now that I’ve taken the big decision un-private my account) and witnessed, except from the Aegean Sea’s crystal clear waters also the launch of a bag we are pretty proud of: Balenciaga’s “Navy” line in the most summery makeover.

So on the 17th of July I flew over to Mykonos to host this very special event for Balenciaga, the cut of the ribbon of the most vacation-ready bag of the year: The “Navy” collection of canvas handbags, crafted from a beige cotton and linen-blend with the Myconian blue for the featured leather’s trims and details. That evening was beautiful, island vibes and the perfect same-color cocktails were designed for a crowd that already did say yes, YES(and cheers) to Mykonos and it’s very own bag.

The three sizes of “Navy” you can find at Freeshop Mykonos. Enjoy!

Balenciaga skirt/Balenciaga sweater(Both via FreeShop-Balenciaga Mykonos)/Jimmy Choo flats.

I’ve heard that actually it’s cold in Paris…Am I right? I feel you my beloved Frenchies so here is one post dedicated to you.. Balenciaga Pre-Fall 15 for the breezy, almost wintery summer days. I know weather got cuckoo lately, no less nuts than me though, who I did sport this heavy armor in Mykonos. The  challenge has been the following: to choose my favourite outfit from the Balenciaga pop-up shop in the Cycladic island. An easy quest if I may because more or less I always know exactly which items I wish from the upcoming collections. And that angora sweater had stolen my heart from the moment I saw it popping out Vogue’s pages. This and a heartbreaking set of high-waisted pants with suspenders, a duo that still hasn’t been delivered to the stores. The truth is that I have a thing with the fluffy sweaters. If you think about it, they are the epitome of lazy-fall-dressing as you don’t need anything to cover-up, to get warm or to look gorgeous. They are too gorgeous and too warm on their own. As for the shirt…Maybe the easiest statement piece of the upcoming season. YAS! I adore this. Envelop-ing with these bicolor great yet non-binding buttons, ready to match with almost every-single top in my wardrobe because… as you already know it, I’m a black n’white girl…what can I do?!

Body and mind sync on the Parisian nights….

You can find my online picks from Balenciaga Pre-Fall 15 below:

Back to almost winter clothing (and I say almost because this stealthy greyness belongs to the McQ Alexander McQueen Pre-Fall collection) with one coat so-chic and classy that could be seen on my all-time heroines, Lauren Hutton and Francoise Hardy. Thank GAWD, we have finally reached the turning point in fashion that trends are no more worshiping the unflattering bulkiness (or as I name it HULK-Y-NESS),  but on the contrary, they currently adore the more feminine shapes. The woman’s body is put on the map again guys and for the upcoming season the outerwear are SO buttery soft that can actually be worn as a dress, a very sexy one if you leave then unbuttoned. Do you feel it? I did and still do, demanding an invitation to cooler climates just because I need to RE-wear this stunner SOON. Yeah, winter is not coming, pffff give me a break!

*Lame(λαμέ): shiny fabrics or the excessive use of sequins(the Greek way)

Saturday night, my favorite day since I have actual memories and that tiny part of the week when my most beloved outfits got out of the closet for a stroll or for a dance marathon If I got lucky. And I really loved(and still love) to dance, have I ever told you that? WHEN on the dance floor I’ve had the energy of a Duracell bunny and Rihanna’s moves at the Barbados Carnival Parade. Blame it ONLY on my greek genes. My (very)dancing ones.
So this post is for all of you who ask me what to wear during the hottest nights of the week without feeling overdressed.
-Wait a minute lady, you are all over sequins and you are not feeling over-freakin-dressed? You must be drunk!
Well I am 100 percent alcohol free and I can reassure you that if you wear your most glamorous dress, the Holly Grail of your closet, your shine-bright-as-a-diamond armour(yes we listen a lot of Rihanna on this blog) paired with a simple, plain black pair of ballerinas then not only you won’t feel overdressed but you’ll also look as chic as one very modern Jackie-O. And even when it happens to be amongst the super tall Danes, like I was for the past few days, that’s not a bummer, you won’t be that dwarf, you’ll be the coolest million-dollar-babe ready who knows how to look beautiful even in loads  and I mean LOADS of sequins.

Love this pictures!! The dress is super cool!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

If for every given male character, there is a female version of that character, then I would totally be Elton John’s alter ego. Not that I have a great voice, on the contrary I actually sing like a donkey. The only thing in common though is that me and the legendary singer, we both love to collect sunglasses. Yeap, my make-up disaster saviours, my best hang-over cure (you know when your face looks like the Scream-mask and your biggest sunglass is your one and only chance to cover up your mess) have a prominent place in my wardrobe, in a hand-made storage box where small wooden rectangle cutout-shapes protect them during their naps. Lately my collection grew up with Cindy series and that’s nothing else but Jimmy Choo’s newest cat-eyes. I don’t know about you but I consider all of these feline shades the most flattering of all as they do give to our aura an alluring almost mysterious-sexy vibe. The five retro colours, the dove grey, gold copper, aqua, honey and (almost) red of Jimmy Choo’s Cindy collection, they bring a much wanted nostalgic fell back to our chicest days. And when you really think about it, cat-eyes are the most gracious of all sunglasses and if they couldn’t bring chic back, well nothing else could…..

You can find Jimmy Choo’s Cindy collection here.

My God, these pictures are brilliant. I love your style.

*The greatest of all if I may.

It’s almost an urban legend the changing of weather conditions every single time I shoot with Jeff in NY. Either it’s snowing or raining but in the most severe way, that means storms or even a hell of a blizzard situation. After so many times we, both, have finally accepted that someone curses us. An evil witch in disguise! ….However, we try, against all odds to make the most fun of it.

Bip bip bip…Evangelie is shooting, NY is going on lockdown…#severeweatherwarning
So here I am, braving a NY monsoon in order to demonstrate to the universe that If an outfit is great, even when it’s completely soaked, it still look absolutely awesome.
The thing that I’ve realised lately, is that it doesn’t necessarily mean that only a good design makes a great staple. The material must be also greater. There are poplins and poplins, denim and denim, wool and wool out there. Lemaire has succeeded to marry both of the aforementioned ingredients to make the essentials-recipe, 3 star Michelin worthy. Honestly It’s only until you wear his shirts to understand that they are really something else. The softest touch of their cotton feels like the most precious silk. Nope, I am not drunk, it’s just that my first encounter with the Essentials’ king was simply unforgettable. You have to see and most importantly try all of his simple-lined pieces and you’ll also conclude that investing on awesome staples is the most genius gift you can offer to yourselves.

Here we are almost in the middle of summer, heat-wav-ed, yet constantly dreaming of the upcoming winter collections. In the past, I wondered why the designing houses do show that early before the actual collections hit the stores and cause to us long and uncontrollable cravings. But only recently, after I’ve  found a vitamin-elixir(similar to Asterix’s) which actually over-fed my very thirsty brain cells(I’ll talk about this in a future post) the answer became pretty obvious: Nothing is ready, EXCEPT THE SHOWPIECES, the designing houses need to take the numbers from the buyers and these numbers finalize their production’s process. The biggest the demand, the hardest the factories will work to supply.

Back to the model-march typhoon, that is up, down, everywhere on this post. I must have spent more than three days to see the whole designing-universe folks, a kinda answer to all of you who keep asking me why I haven’t continued designing another collection.  There is everything out there guys, everything that I’ve ever dreamed of and even more, is already strutting down the catwalks. Why should I keep designing?!

So  today, I have selected, according  to my own taste solely, the very best pieces straight from the Winter 15/16 collections. Selected all with care, one by one, the looks that are actually all in my massive wish-list. My real inspiration. Because, between you and me, catwalks do inspire me most of anything….

Enjoy!

Elie Saab gown(similar here)/ Celine sandals(find them at LuisaWorld) similar here and here /Boucheron Jewellery
A million thank you to my most amazing hosts, the Elie Saab team for having me in this extraordinary journey.

The images are from the screening of the movie “The Assassin”

Where to start and where to end….If you are following my Instagram account you do already know that a couple of days ago I’ve been enjoying the light of Cannes invited by the red-carpet-designing-House-extraordinaire Elie Saab. If you don’t follow me well…you see what you’re missing?!

It’s been my first time in Cannes and honestly my whole experience exceeded every prior expectation. My hotel Martinez, is located straight in the heart of the Promenade de la Croisette, the vibrant and so crowded heart of Cannes.  You couldn’t approach the entrance of the hotel if you hadn’t pointed out to the security guys your room key as Martinez was the refugee of many celebrities and inevitably their massive following who had caused a daily traffic pandemonium around it. With some time management though that couldn’t be any trouble but appreciation for their sweet faces waiting under the sun for hours to see their beloved movie-heroes.

The first day has been majorly (well spent) in the Elie Saab showroom, a cinematic suite on the third floor of the hotel with sunning views of the windy French Riviera. Entering the room was like a BAM in the heart as the first thing you noticed has been an Elie Saab Haute Couture feather gown seducing you like the mediterranean Sirens. I’m telling you guys I hadn’t be able to think anything but the obsessing ‘Mine-Mine-MINE’ triple wording. All I wanted was to hug and squeeze and love this dress and actually all of its surrounding, the House’s whole Haute Couture collection that is. Breath control with some extra water and I was ready for my fitting. I’ve been obsessing over this lace dress for  a year or more so I’ve been literally ecstatic when I’ve realised that Elie Saab’s team had found it for me. Breezy, lightweight stripes of lace ending in an almost hybrid-athletic upper part. It was so perfect and unexpectedly it didn’t need any adjustments for my body so we proceeded to our dinner by the sea.

The next day, was the big one, my first ever steps on the Cannes’ Film Festival carpet, the red short line. And I’m saying ‘short’ because it’s definitely a smaller walk  than expected. HOWEVER I kinda get it because one thing’s for sure: You cannot run a marathon on heels. The way to the film screening should be short and effective, by effective I mean that I’ve never seen so many photographers in my entire life! I’m so surprised that I didn’t faint(I’m sure the Sambuka shot prior with my partners’ in crime Gala and Nathalie helped a bit). All went well, the actual existence of these pictures is the witness and happily ever reached the indoors of the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès.

To be continued….

You’re invited to see Cannes through my eyes below….enjoy!


WHAT TO WEAR:

Have fun and be yourself, the more individual and creative the better – embrace the mood and free style of Basel!
Colors, prints, stripes and florals even though I often end up in black!!!
Sneakers for walking around the Art Basel fairs and events all day and night as there is always a lot of ground to cover!
I take a backpack with me almost everywhere to carry my gear, make sure you check prior if you can bring your detachable lens camera
Sunglasses snd hats are a must – day into night to shade the potential lack of sleep under the bright lights
WHAT TO DO:

Pick the art fairs that are your life style ( https://www.thetaylorsauce.com/art-daze/ ) and pre-purchase tickets because the lines are long and you cannot cover them all!
Check out the open exhibitions in the hotels supporting Art Basel – there are often amazing hidden gems and you can walk through anytime
Spend the day taking in the murals and street art at Wynwood
Stroll around the Design District for great stores and unique interiors
Walk along South Beach as there are so many sculptures in public spaces such as Collins Park and the beach!

WHERE TO HANG:

The hotels always have awesome events and are great to just walk through with loads of art installations open to the public
At the fairs of course – I love Scope, Pulse, Untitled and Project
The Broken Shaker and 27 at the Freehand Hostel for fun vibes!
The Confidante Hotel has really fun events like Public School x Art Basel!
Poolside – my favorite way to relax and take it all in while in South Beach
WHERE TO EAT:

Le Sandwicherie – so so good for sandwiches and fresh juice on the go!
The Naked Taco for amazing healthy and fresh tacos!!!
Mandolin Aegean Bistro – I absolutely love Greek food and this place never disappoints not to mention that the courtyard is lunch perfection!
The Continental for a fun brunch scene, vintage vibes and photos
Casa Tua for a magical group dinner and how I like to close out Basel!
WHERE TO STAY:

Raleigh Hotel – old school art deco decor and vintage style
1 Hotel South Beach – beautiful decor and a great lobby meeting spot
SLS South Beach – lots of late night fun and lovely food at The Bazaar
Faena – cool new hotel and hosts amazing events during Basel too

Summer keys, not summer kiss, destined for Florida Keys.

Are you confused? Ok, ok, enough with the shameless word playing. We are here in an attempt to demonstrate the summer’s essentials. The key pieces you need to pack with you, whether you go to and island or to a city.
Denim, lace, broderie anglaise.

That’s all you need guys, the no-time essentials which will accompany you all-vacation-around. I’ve really wanted to make this post for a long, long time because in the past I’ve always ended up with overstuffed luggage that made my dressing process chaotic. In simple words I could not decide what to wear. It’s like going to a shop that the clothes are hung from the racks like sardelles. Can you shop like that? Well I can’t. Same way with your luggage.

That, thank gawd, changed! Lately I’ve restrained my need to take all my house(and the neighbour’s) with me and I concentrate only on key items that will turn my vacation mode into a happily-ever-after mode.

Denim is effortless, broderie anglaise for poolside chic and lace to beautify the breezy nights. Do you need something more? I don’t!

There are times like this when a project comes across your desk that inspires you, brings you joy and more specifically, in our case, teleports you in a cloud of smoke closer than ever to the absolute summer. This editorial’s concept ended up nothing at all like what I had in mind before getting my hands on Rouge Coco, the iconic lipsticks by the eternal Queen, Chanel. The power of their unexpected freshness got me under its spell and I didn’t want to create anything less than my most joyful ever editorial.

So you’ve probably already noticed that my usual make-up ritual is rather minimal, with (always) centre of my attention brows and lips.  But when it comes to my lips lately they are unreasonably chapped and intensely dry. A huge bummer when you love to wear red colours. However when I did apply for the first time the Rouge Coco lipsticks, guys I SWEAR, they literally melted on my lips. “One brow raised” realness for  the most vibrant, juiciest lips I’ve had for a long time. And since I’ve already mentioned that I adore the usually-too-difficult-to-find-summer-reds, I have to tell you that the Coco palette, has the youngest, freshest shades, super easy to apply, worry free, even if your make-up skills resemble to American Horror Story’s clown. Not a good example of a classic beauty but you get it no?

All of the above just because sometimes it’s good to know by a non-proffesional beauty expert that the aforementioned double-C series is the brightest, juiciest lip explosion, you’ll ever have… ENJOY!

 

 

Gorgeous images!
You outdo yourself every time.

Hi Evangelie!
I haven’t written anything for a long time, but I come around almost every day (well, that sounds like stalking). I just wanted you to know that you’re still my style heroine and now you’re also my beauty heroine. This is the best editorial ever, I can literally feel the breeze and the sun on my face…  not to mention about juicy lip colors:) I’m pretty sure I need more beauty editorials from you.

Thank you so much Izabel! You words are everything! I love beauty post and I have some for you in the future.
Lots of love,
Evangelie

The red one is my favorite!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

One thing’s for sure: There are no Cannes without films.

Your girl is starring in her first ever movie produced by Elie Saab, ‘Feux Croisés’, a funny short video, filmed in my room during my stay in The French Riviera… for your eyes only.
So….is it too late to change my career path? Do tell!

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

Looking my reflection in the windows underneath the shadows of NY’s skylines, I’ve almost thought I were some kind of mysterious extraterrestrial creature. Long hands, fish net bag, slouchiest pants…Still sane yet crazier than ever. It wasn’t the first time I’ve been breaking the rules of fashion but I was definitely feeling better than ever. Vetements, a teamwork headed up by Demna Gvasalia, are the cool kids’  latest favorites and the ones to watch. And if you argue that reconstruction of the basics is not a new idea I will answer that yes it’s not yet crossing the lines and still look good, awesome if I may, yes IT IS.

You can see an BOOM selection of Vetements here.

/First there was the tuxedo suit, then Saint Laurent introduced us to the tuxedo jumpsuit and now we shake hands with the smoking hot Scandis and their tuxedo DRESS. All hail probably the most masculine dress you’ll ever witness which with a surprisingly twist of luck, if removing the shirt could ever mean that, would be the sexiest deep plunge dress on earth. Yes guilty I am, I also wore it like this and god is my witness guys I could see my belly button before I’ve been fatally taped. Fatally because that night there was a whole new meaning to the until recently romantic “really inseparable”. I’ve been mummified with double-faced tapes in order not-to-free-my-nipples to the crowd.

-Why dear, aren’t you enough brave? WHAT KINDA HEROINE ARE YOU?

Well I was in Dallas celebrating the exclusive launch of Mary Katranzou x MatchesFASHION.COM  and apparently I did want to enjoy sporting the beautiful bags than constantly covering my lemons….If only I had remembered to pack my bandeau top….next time…

Hello from the beautiful Dallas and the awesome Reward Style conference. Currently enjoying/phototosynthezing the Texan sun and utterly motivated to talk about our summer’s hero pieces(and perhaps the winter’s ones if you’ll take a look at Isabel Marant’s newest collection) the striped dresses. Who wants a dress to wear everywhere?  Raise your hand! I’m pretty certain that all hands around this block are already up in the air. Your vehicle to drive you unmistakably around the day (or night) is printed…. horizontally. A refuge for the sleepy morning brain cells which do refuse to decide matchy matchy pieces or dinner outfits. Striped dresses are our not-so new hero pieces, our time savers, our chic boosters. Woo-hoo!

It’s almost midnight, I’m almost hungry (because just a few days earlier it was a reasonable time for someone to eat lunch on the other side of the pond), I am almost sure that my depicted jumpsuit needed some ironing done and IT’S DEFINITELY SURE THAT I DONT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO PACK. Leaving again in just seven hours and you can see still totally empty my luggage’s bottom. Bottom’s up guys let’s have  a wine and make it fast. Wine gives you wings to fly!

From hair to waist, all sky-high everything…

My hair does suffer from some kind of mysterious blonding curse which graciously gifted my scalp with a few new pairs of well-groomed cockroach’s antennae to sense NY’s high-vibes. YES, I won’t lie, my hair has been broken. Almost platinum’s side effects have eventually showed up. When it comes to hair though nothing is irreversible or non fixable as long as I keep in mind my mom’s biggest beauty secret that is no other than pure olive oil. DON’T EAT IT, at least don’t do it before applying it directly to your hair, leave for an hour or so and then clean it away only with shampoo at the beginning  and then rinse it with water. Before ditching the idea of smelling like a Greek salad, just remember that it really works. Moms know better, been there, said that…

In another news my seasonal search for the highest waisted pants has happily-ever-after ended in NY by finding DAT awesomeness. By DAT I mean the depicted Rodarte. They are the highest of all, the Burj Khalifa of the pants and before you rush to judge me, yes that’s good. The highest the waistline rests above your hips, the tallest you’ll look. That simple. Just remember…size up on these jeans. They are so, so tight and on this blog…well, we don’t want you to suffer….

New York really agrees with you, you look so chic ! Love the flats and jacket, and olive oil did wonder to your hair !
http://www.pardonmyobsession.com/

I am getting more and more into high waisted jeans. It’s true, it makes you look taller, sitting just below the waistline is perfect! and they are so comfortable! I love the outfit.;-). You used to be a brunette and now you are a blondie, either way, when  ones hair is damaged, olive oil is the  ultimate solution to restore its shine and health! mommas around the world and styleheroine, thanks for the tip !!

Back to basics, in childhood, when it has been a struggle for me to find a shirt shorter than my jacket. I really liked long tops but if my jacket did not cover over my shirt, my mom could not stop yelling “Oh it looks so bad” and  “no way my birdie to get out of the house like that”. Since little birdie loved her cropped bomber at that point of time, stuffing her blouses in her pants has been the unspoken rule to set her free. Yes…I wouldn’t exactly pronounce my school years rebellious but more “preppy”. Time-ages passed by, limits have been crushed and now my mom proudly sports thick lines showing under her own outerwear. Well if you ask me, I think that fashion’s own past has been full of borderlines and generous “no”, taboos and categorizations, all currently, thank god belong to the aforementioned past. Nowadays fashion is all about feeling confident in our own clothes and if that is my shirt to cover my bottom when my jacket hardly does the same for my waist, well so be it!

Small checks are chic checks.

I concluded  to this after hours of contemplating if the all-time-classic motif does resemble to a picnic clothing. Well adorable fashion is not for us, no no no and the answer lies within the size. Gingham, in other words the small-checked cloth in white and a bold, in my case blue, color, is the most wanted one and it’s here to stay. I’m thrilled that (maybe) the most flattering pattern of the style dictionary is back. As I’ve confessed to you gazillion of times I hate it when patterns approach in less than 20cm distance near to my face. That’s not applied though to gingham. Much to my surprise its vivid motifs have the effects of the most delicious skin glowing smoothie. Oh yes, these small yet bold checks could dramatically(yet periodically) improve how your skin tone looks. Now I sound like a telemarketing ad…Do-you-believe-me?

Kick starting my Portugal tour by saluting a fine British act, an act that apparently made my appearance no less than impressive at the absolutely mesmerizing surroundings of Lisboa. Raey alongside with Portugal have been both the most pleasant surprises during the past week.

Raey is actually the newborn of matchesfashion.com. I guess their many years of experience in the fashion industry have been proved extremely fruitful because guys I swear, on my blogger’s honor, they are killing it. Clean lines combined with the best materials, a somehow hard-to-get match out there. You absolutely have to experience their fine cashmere knits. If you close your eyes and face the sun, they do feel like a spring day in Portofino, a perfect escape, what fashion should be all about…..

Click below to see my top choices from Raey collection.

Even though I am currently touring Portugal’s mesmerizing shores (post-avalanche is coming soon) I didn’t want to do the long distance thing, you know the communication-non-existence-eventually-separates-couples thing. So here I am, giving you a life-sign, by popping you up in Paris. Yes my reality has been a bit complicated lately, with a lot of traveling and some short(thank god) drama. Yet Paris is always a good idea, especially if it’s depicted by Carin’s photography. Back to our usual ftopics*, Ellery has been lately my favorite Aussie. This girl is not only a remarkable designer but also a stunner. To be honest with you before meeting Kym Ellery in Paris, I hadn’t done my homework properly thus I had never actually checked how did she look like. So when I’ve been introduced to her during my visit at Ellery’s Parisian showroom I was stunned. A beautiful young woman who looked nonchalantly cool in her own designs. A muse for her own collection. And then it hit me. How rare it really is that the designers to create their collections having in mind not only to please their market but also themselves? To wear and feel confident in their own creations? If you actually think that the majority of the design houses have as their creative directors men, then the answer is obvious. And if you ask me if that’s one of the ingredients of a massive-success-formula well…when combined with talent and good aesthetics, I will answer YES…it can be, and Kym has it all.

Be careful, in french when a woman says you’ve found my button, it has another signification… Very daring, if you follow my meaning. Lol.
I love your work, keep it up.
Take care.

Hand’s up who’s up for a ride! Cause If we are gonna build a time machine, that would be definitely in a car(stolen from Back to the Future).

So back to time and altogether we head to North, towards the Vikings ex-territory(obviously I am also obsessed with these series) and the most beautiful Copenhagen. It has been a couple of months ago and the chill season had just started but I could still stroll around the city in my personal favorite outfit from By Malene Birger’s Winter 15 collection. Straight from the catwalk, blending with the grey bricks of the city, By Milene ‘s totally relaxed approach to menswear, came to prove that yes, the Queen of women suits actually exists. And apparently is Danish. All hail the Danish Queen!!

 

Stunning suit! Great combo with a brown bag!

The shooting took place at Hotel Infante Sagres in Porto, Portugal.
Is it only me or whenever you also touch linen,  your biological blaring alarm clock surprisingly does sound like summer? If hitting the snooze button for the 10th time is your go-to solution to forget sunny days, in our case it simply does not work. Linen is the rare case of material connected with only one season. The aforementioned.

And vice versa, when I’ve been packing for Portugal, in the back of my mind I had the tropics and that simultaneously resulted the first thing chosen for my trip… linen.  That doesn’t necessary means that I’ve actually met the tropics…It has been very pleasant weather-wise but when the sun  went down, well you needed an EXTRA jacket.

So how cool guys are the Azulejos or else the Portuguese tiles? This post could be a photo gallery dedicated to their art but on an unexpected turn of corner my back, the Mega-Valentino-T did steal the lights. And I am not the kind of a girl obsessed with how her back looks. Imagine when a hairdresser brings over the mirror to check how the haircut from behind this usually ends up with me hysterically laughing, I mean who checks your hair from behind? They might check other parts of your body but hair?!  However there comes the time when good photography reminds me….that back actually matters and in the future, my nervous breakdowns should be eliminated only when slicing onions….True story.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.


My Parisian gift to all of you that I believe you’ve devastately missed me. The most anticipated winter collection will go live in just a few hours. With all my love guys, enjoy the new Valentino collection!


Maison Valentino regal as usual! Love it!

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

And by T I don’t mean Tequila season. It would be nice though.

So when it comes to heels the biggest hit of the spring is the T-bar, the very welcomed sometimes tick, other times thin, vertical strap. In the shoe-theory of the limb elongators, they are the catalysts. Yes, you have to believe me, It’s my own, almost academic, case study. T-straps do show your legs longer. And according to Mara’s own words “Have you ever seen a dancer with short legs? This is the dance-shoes evolution girl!”

Below is my top T-team. Enjoy!

The show images by me.

Benjamin Button-ing the fashion week and that means starting from the last day ending to the first, your Parisian report kicks off with white. White dressing for the best fashion show per me(even though I shouldn’t openly take a stand), Valentino’s winter collection showing left its audience with a smile on the face. Exit poll gone fab and happily curved mouths on their way out of the Tuileries’ tent.  And the surprise that nobody knew… Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson took over the final walk of the show, sending the audience, including me, into a frenzy. And thank god my reflexes worked fast enough to shoot video of “Hansel’ fiercest than ever. But if you ask me that wasn’t the highlight of the show. The highlight has been its own protagonists, Maria Grazia and Pierpaolo’s winter nymphs. There are no words to describe the beauty of Valentino’s new collection and certainly there are no words to describe the admiration I feel for the aforementioned designing duo, who worked so hard for the past four months to produce two Haute Couture collections and two R-T-W. Is it humanly possible? Well, not only it is but it’s a bright example that people can overcome themselves and produce little miracles. The collection itself has been absolutely poetic. Floating transparencies, mosaic patterns and Victorian silhouettes all blended in a very contemporary way. Wanna see the doted bow that has already stolen my heart? Of course you do!


Looking fab as usual!

No mom as much as you try to brainwash me, I have not returned back to my natural roots. The depicted awesomely sunwear-ed me is looking back to the previous fashion week, when the super talented Melanie Galea  shot me at the undoubtedly most beautiful bridge in Paris, Pont Alexandre III.

The Felder twins translated their signature style into a bespoke selection of glasses called Special Edition FelderFelder for Silhouette and me and Melanie found the chance to celebrate it just after the magical Valentino show dressed in the House’s stealthy perfection. Looking back, I am so looking forward to times like these….

The only garment that could support nudity and I mean that even if you are naked inside, nobody would actually care. Happy first of March lil fellas and what a better way to start this month with a statement jacket, probably my favorite pieces of the wardrobe. Pieces that remove all the unnecessary brainstorming of what to wear as all they need to be matched with is the maximum simplicity. And you must know by now the motto of this blog, no? Simplicity IS the greatest ability, yes, yes so far we haven’t changed here. So if a single jacket creates a sense of an absolute need, it is the greatest of all. A turtleneck, a t-shirt or a buttoned down can be easily paired, with the only required premise to be monochrome.. Let your statement jacked do the monologue, I am sure everybody will love its loud voice.


And…just because I adore them, below is my top list of the spring statement jackets. Enjoy!

The shooting took place at Palais De Tokyo, right after Elie Saab‘s Haute Couture show.

A different color shade does change your life, not in every single way, that will only happen by moving to Honolulu. What needs urgently adjustments thought, is your wardrobe. For example golden accents previously banished, now are welcomed with open arms. However life with blonde is not so pink as it sounds. My favorite “all black everything” belongs to my not-so-long-ago past as it looks like a bad dominatrix-joke when matched with my yellow undertones. Who’s the boss now woman?

Hair is the boss…I should have known better…..

The images are outtakes from my shoot for Harper’s Bazaar Japan March issue.

To be completely honest, god, it was an incredible week. For sure the best one I’ve experienced as a blogger so far. At the begging of my New York journey I’ve gone strawberry blonde for US Harper’s Bazzar , thing that still gets me super excited every-time my new head pops-up in the mirror, after just two days I’ve been shot by Winnie Au for the feature on Harper’s Bazaar Japan’s March Issue (while working with  the sweetest, super fast and uber professional team) and finally I’ve experienced the ultimate beauty of Valentino‘s exclusive NY Haute Couture show, the real reason I’ve actually visited the Big Apple, an once-in-lifetime show, an all-white pure magic to celebrate the House’s new Fifth Avenue’s Flagship store, a collection, as I’ve already told you for so many times, I feel extremely grateful and honored that I’ve witnessed live, with all of my senses. These outtakes from my Harper’s Bazaar Japan shoot come to restore my euphoria levels to the point I feel I’m leaving the dream all over again….Ahhhhhh breath….thx

Head in the clouds(literally and metaphorically) and one of my favorite combination kimono & shirt. That’s all for today.

 Two years have passed since the last time I wore this match and it really makes me wonder  a: why has it been so long and b: does time go faster as we get older? These are NOT logical questions that need answers. Actually don’t even think about at all. It’s Saturday folks, let’s just enjoy the spring-ish sun wearing a freaking awesome kimono….Breaking-free!

If a Greek had told you a couple of years ago that the spring coats, did actually exist, then either he has been confused or almost lying. In our sunny part of the Mediterranean coast we’ve had just three seasons: Winter, almost summer and summer. During the freakin-cold days you couldn’t actually survive without your duvet thrown over your shoulders. The rest of the months all you needed was your tanning lotion, a hat, a white t-shirt and during the breeziest days a cardigan. Lately though, due the climate changes, spring has been our newly found (and very precious) season. A season  that almost turns our faces emoji-blue during the brisk nights. Nowadays we need the spring coats people. We, the formerly tank-brave ones, admit it. It’s not that bad though. Because if you ask me I kinda prefer them over the chunky winter ones. They are so oh-much  chicer as my Nick would say. I’m starting to getting used to the half-year-cover-up idea and to be honest yes, I like almost it.

How to make mama-bees to stop? Once they have invaded your personal space you have no choice: You gotta to do their own thing.

Since I actually remember me in adulthood, I also remember my mom’s voice inside my head dictating me:

Were suits! They suit you!

At the beginning I wore them partially to please her and majorly to stop the noise. Later though I realised that my mom, for some extraterrestrial reason, she always knew, before me, what’s better for me. Still I haven’t concluded if it’s a matter of aesthetics or of her pure unconditional love that she’s always right.

So yes mom, suits, suit me better….now I know!

Τόσο ανδρόγυνο και συνάμα τόσο θηλυκό!
Σου ταιριάζει γάντι γιατί ενώ φαίνεσαι άκρως δυναμική, ταυτόχρονα έχεις κάτι τόσο αριστοκρατικό, που παραπέμπει σε άλλη εποχή!

Even thought our bodies still needs feather duvets to get protected from the absolutely teeth chattering cold, our mind is travelling directly to the more spring-ish lands where the airy white dresses all that they need is love and well…a leather jacket. The spring collections are already in stores and so an army of very delicious leather jackets waiting for onion-look-alike layers or for more shiny days to cover us.
So cheers to warmer days and to the best leather jackets!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Coat, leather cullotes and pumps By Malene Birger Fall 15, bag Celine(similar here and here)

Ph Fransiska Frisesdahl

The shooting took place in The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Museum.

Copenhagen IS a darling. In all terms. Fashion, food, people. It’s been actually my third visit to the Danish capital and it’s delight By Malene Birger. Yes, my third fashion week in Copenhagen made me realize how time flies, even faster than you ever thought possible. And if you ask me if things have been changed, well my answer will be yes and no. No from the site of Denmark, Copenhagen is still the coolest, most likeable and beautiful city in Scandinavia(alongside with Stockholm) with happy and genuinely polite people.  What has been changed thought it concerns to the guests of honor. Same people yet different personalities. It’s really interesting to watch from distance the transition of some of my fellow bloggers. A great part of them continue to be sweet and respectful to the reason that they owe their cyber existence and that is fashion while some others, thankfully a small percentage of them, have been transformed to the point  you actually wonder if you spell their name correctly. Someone will argue that’s how life really is but I’d like to think that blaming life is a huge mistake. In every single fashion week there must always be a silent reminder on the back of our brains that we are here for the same reason, to celebrate the new seasons and feel honored that we have the chance to do so. And HAPPY! That’s all, simple, clear and no drama.

Anyway… back to fashion and By Malene Birger’s F/W 15 show, a collection destined to make women feel good, special and safe. For this winter By Malene Birger has evolved the staples. Essentials like pin-striped and check wool blazers matched with their tapered pants, the most beautiful ribbed tops in jewel tones and my personal favorites, the wool tailored coats(with a soft spot of the one in this mesmerizing midnight-blue shade). This is a collection of key items and you’ll see it coming me wearing them, starting from…. now!

Enjoy!


this a beautiful outfit: masculine ,sleek and chic.  I Iove Malene Birger’s designs.
I totally relate to what you say about bloggers who become full of themselves..There is also one thing I have noticed lately , once some (many) bloggers start to collaborate with grand fashion houses, it goes to their head one way or another and instead of keeping their own style, they turn into boring brand hangers..They forget where they come from, lose purpose and style identity..that is a pity and very boring for the readers, at least,” mature” readers. I am one of these 😉 and I instantly stop visiting their blogs..hmm
Actally, discovering you and your style thanks to  Fashionguitar!.
nice discovery:).!

What a wonderful coat! Shame it doesn’t come with your razor sharp cheekbones 😉

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?

I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

Even thought Jeff instructions were specific “Do not Photoshop a thing”(yes the latest posts’ images are exactly as they’re born from their Daddy’s camera), I’m here to plead guilty and beg for forgiveness…

-I’m so sorry Jeff but I’ve photoshopped my…crotch!

Although I deeply love these pants after some times of use, they massively slouch to add to my figure some really masculine features(pipi)…Liquify and back in the game because in real life I’m clueless if there actually is a solution. Wash them every day?Pffffff….

Enough with filling your pretty heads with my own sartorial issues and let’s talk about good stuff and these are no other than sales and they are major! Have you already checked the Net-A-Porter’s vavavoom ones? What you have?! But of course. And what was been the first thing added to your wish list? And I don’t know about you but I, since I am a shoe-girl and since the winter has already showed its claws, I’ve been eyeing a few of the over-the-knee boots, my latest fetish as it seems. And because I love and I know how to share, you can find below some of my favorite ones. Enjoy.

And just at the moment when I’ve started to feel at ease with my newly found under-my-umbrella reality, well it was about time to return. Is it always like that? When you’re just getting used to something, at this very point,  do you always have to let it go?! So I left back my umbrella, actually it was Jeff’s oh-so-stylish protector, yet I brought back my coat, a very favorite one, a piece that everybody should own per me. I know that there are some girls who might not look at their best when they wear tailored pieces but my body-type absolute adores them. Honestly if  I had to choose only one coat for this season, it would be it and even If I had to take only one to the Big Apple, it would be still it.

-So much love?

Stop being judgemental and just imagine it over a wool dress or a denim shirt if you live in the very-sunny-lately Greece. So actually yes, so much love….



Beautiful style!

Ohmygod your new layout, these images I DIE!! So amazing, go gurrl!

This just became my favorite post of all time! Sometimes it’s hard figuring out what to wear on a rainy day but I must admit you nailed it! Those white pants seal the deal.

It’s a day dedicated to celebrating the efforts of my colorist to transform me into blonde and still have every single hair attached to my scalp. My last post as a brunette, adios Medusa, will be saluted with my favorite gold, a color that apparently (and hopefully permanently) moved to the upper part of my body. Until recently gold could only be found on my chest and my middle finger.  The first one is a pure, clean engraved with my initials (I adore that, just in case I’m lost you know) disc and a small anchor charm that reminds me my home, the sea and the place I always need to return when my mind gets lost… The second one is my protector. It belonged to my great-grandfather, has been lost in the fields and found by my grandfather while he’d been digging for gold potatoes. With a closer look you can see a tiny rupture from the massive hit on the sapphire, an imperfection to remind me that indeed, there is always an untold story in every single flaw.

ahahahah, bye bye…but u are gorgeous in any case

My last editorial for Net-A-Porter Holiday(and one of my last as a brunette, if you haven’t already noticed, yes I’ve been transformed into a strawberry blonde and I adore it) is all about fantasy gifts. Fantasy gifts as popular as a pair of sexy stilettos, to the rare and kinda humble ones, like the perfect cashmere knit. Yes it was that hard to find it that inevitably ended up as a fantasy. Equipment knows well how to make shirts and latest, almost surprisingly, armies of absolutely gorgeous knits. Heavenly soft and  totally luxurious. The trust pal to accompany our days or the not-so-dressy nights. Never be lonely again….

So do tell, what’s your fantasy gift? Maybe Santa can hear you….Speak louder!

By choosing the hero pieces, that is, the play-safe-stay-forever pieces, the items that my daughter(the mini heroine) might inherit (if she excited).

Parka Marni/Jumpsuit Heroine By Tom Wood.

Ph George Angelis

I certainly don’t belong to the layer-league, that is the very private women-only club in which entrance is guaranteed If you layer like an onion and still look good. Thus I have to wear something, one single unit, that is not an outdoor heater and can actually keep me warm during the coldest days. I’m talking about parkas the biggest invention after the wheel. Polymorphic, adjustable and absolutely chic when worn over dresses. Below you can find my kinda endless parkas’ list because nobody wants to freeze in the corner..

I know, I know….the nast-ies haunted you the whole previous fashion year, walked approx 583 miles yet still are my favorites, the ones that practically match even with the craziest granny-outfit I wear…For what is worth…look up…down…and back. This time you have my permission…because smart girls never look back!

Evangelie… You look stunning, as always. Every time i read/see your posts, I feel so proud of you being Greek!
Many kisses from mademoiselle-rania.blogspot.com

Love the combination of the knits! Got to try something like that myself 😉

It’s almost that time of the year. 

The Christmas trees have already set up, the streets are aglow with fairy lights and compilations of seasonal songs slowly hit the radio stations(I don’t know about you but GOD…Someone to ban the stations that they do still play the unbearable autorepeating of “Last Christmas”, “Let it snow” or “Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer”. My ears are hurting!)

Let’s be honest, there’s nothing like Christmas guys and during that day all of us are secretly praying to crash on a pile of gifts upon entering our house. Isn’t it true? Well this year Net-A-Porter created the Holiday Shop to aim at ensuring this possibility, fantasy fashion rooms to choose your fairytale gifts, that is. 

During the following days, you’re gonna witness a series of editorials with my obsessions from these please-lock-me-inside rooms, starting with my favorite accessories, items that I’ve really wanted for a long, long time, these kind of accessories that you Can’t Go Wrong when you gift….Enjoy!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Remember when the clubs were fun? I (almost) tend to forget it.

So it’s Saturday night, the only big night of the week the 20-year old  me used to go out, the only night of the week the depicted me stays at home to avoid shrouded in a haze of cigarette smoke(yes we still do smoke right in your face in Greece).

From airplane directly to the keyboard, after a flash business trip to Monaco(get ready for an avalanche of latergrams) showcasing my biggest yet love for this winter. When suited, coat with a cardigan. It’s absolutely, freaking clash of styles and that might be the extra reason of loving it more. A chunky warm piece, to protect your sharp shoulders from the winter tap. Needless to say that the Acne suit is my soft spot for this season…I’m sure you’ve already got it!


Love this game

Looking great as usual!

Seven days is a long break for a blog. I’m not gonna excuse myself by telling you that I’ve had million things to do, so please forgive me, I will always love you bla, blah, bla.. No, no, no. My boss, who’s actually me, was expecting too much from Ev so I took a break, entered the free stress zone just before  my energy plummet. To be totally honest this unexpected epiphany came after one of the longest conversations Mara & I had during one of our evening strolls by the sea. I was inexcusably grumpy, complaining that I’ve been continuously tired and totally uninspired.  At that moment my friend suggested to deal with it professionally and like any other job to have at last a real break.  And she was right. Since 2011 I had never taken some time off  from blogging. Even when I’ve been on vacations, I’ve been having photo shoots , posting or even  discussing new collaborations. I was never absent. I have never hung the “do not disturb” tag. So for the past few days my fingers have been totally keyboard-free and the trial…is almost rejuvenating.

And I am back! Dressed like a wrapped gift, celebrating the return of the sharp tailoring. Yes, the timeless stylish shapes  have made a comeback putting the boxy ones to rest for a while. If you ask me(and my mom), it was about time to salute the  oversized elements. Something that we practically owe to the 70’s revival, if you  will. 

So bring the sexy back fashion! We missed it, lady.


 

Wow you look great, really love

Kiss kiss.*Jo

Όσο και αν οι boxy και oversized γραμμές μας άρεσαν και μας έκαναν να νιώθουμε άνετα και χαλαρά, νομίζω κι εγώ (και πιστεύω και ΟΟΟΟΛΟΙ οι άντρες αυτής της γης) πως ήταν καιρός για τα πιο θυληκά ρούχα να κάνουν ένα δυναμικό comeback. Πολλά φιλιά, mademoiselle-rania.blogspot.com

It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

It might feel rigid at the beginning but give it a few sit-downs and I promise you’ll forget it even exists!

And when you do…I mean really forget it’s existence….please DON’T bend!

The images got shot before the aforementioned sit-downs thus the lower part of my outfit was stiff as hell. That’s the raw denim guys, trending hugely after Nicolas Ghesquière‘s S/S collection for Louis Vuitton. If you are not familiar with the wording they are the jeans that are not washed after having been dyed during production. Thus their deep blue color that did find their perfect mate on the softest angelique hued knits. The depicted one from A.P.C, per me, is one of the best (until now at least) outthere because it’s actually white and not the yellowish cousin of the so wanted shade like the majority in the market.


So be it guys, opposites attract…I know…you haven’t quite learned yet….

Such a simple but effective look, like your styling! x

Seriously you haven’t noticed? We are brand new, open 24/7. Styleheroine has a new face and a new body, a total lift, if I may. However during the next couple of days you will notice some additional changes as we undergo a transitional “baby” phase. And newborns…well they have diaper rushes or in common english minor issues which eventually will be resolved in the near future.

So now that I rung the bells, do tell. Like? Is the new layout good? Do you still love us?

Back to the sartorial purposes of this website, it might be freezing on the half of the hemisphere however my tummy is still standing strong towards the climate changes. Honestly guys I have a soft spot for all the fragile knits and by the word fragile I mean all the sweaters that don’t serve their original cause of existence. That is to keep us warm. Open backs, deep v or the depicted cropped knit all in my “adore” list. What I love most about this top though is its toned shoulders. Cleverly structured to restore the balance to the whole outfit that kinda breaks a totally naked waist.  The perfect proportions by always genius MMM…

 

 

So beautiful !

And just like that our feet have been saved….

I mean it has been really hard for me to imagine sneakers that do fit like a puzzle piece to my own outfits. However the aforementioned past tense explains former situations because guys…how cool is the collaboration between king of chic McQ Alexander McQueen and the Puma !  Sleek leather and nubuck details balanced out with mesh.  Essential hotness if I may… Not to mention, to my mom’s delight, the playful rubber sole that adds a slice of color to my usual monochrome universe.

 

But really I have to ask….Where have you been all the previous fashion weeks? My arches would have been saved….

So here I am just after the Acne show, surprisingly in good condition since, as I have already mentioned, Palais de Tokyo is not the best place to watch a show if it’s hot outside. I had melted, literally and not. Literally because that unavoidably happens when you are in a sauna and metaphorically because I so fell in love with the whole show. It’s a collection that I could live in for the whole next summer. If you don’t believe me check for yourselves. Does it remind you someone?

I am seriously obsessed with those cargo pants! So perfect in every way!! LOVE! Perfection!! Exquisite! Ok, I’ll stop 🙂

Love this look!! The trousers, the jumperrr!! SOSOOO amaazing!!

*Color-surprise.

No, no, no…It’s not a transitional step to the rainbow life, neither an act just to please my mom, who’s constantly complaining about my monochromatic, dark choices. I’ll be what I am. However in rare occasions there might be something out-of-the ordinary that will make my heart pounding in ears. A slice of orange in our case….

-GET IT…GET IT

And you know me…I am a getter…But who could actually resist to Valentino’s color-block supremacy, Marni’s deepest green or Mark Cross’ sleekest red? When it comes to bags we are all too weak ….

In collaboration with Luisa World

 If comfort comes when you flip the sides of your blouse then….just do it! For me there should be not any kind of manuals or rules when dressing. All of us should feel comfortable and confident in our own clothes. And if our back wants to be free instead of our nipples then so be it. The depicted knit’s cleavage was way too deep to be worn over naked chest(and you know how much I dislike layering). On the contrary its structural V was perfect to point out my complete spinal anatomy, no?

You must be kinda willing to get comfortable with the discomfort…

So he were again, back to the future, on that rainy Monday morning at Stella McCartney show. The show was at 10am and I had a super early wake up call just to wash my hair with Paris’ nasty water and then take forever to blow-dry them. The result…the depicted bird’s nest. On Mondays the hairdressers in the city d’amour go on vacation and the clumsy us have to fight with our own Medusa-heads and be on time. And thank God, I was on-time to watch Stella’s ethereal creations, gracefully floating around the Opera Garnier, my second favorite place to see the PFW collections. McCartney did present maybe the most comfortable pieces of the season with personal favorites, of course, the silk parachute flight suits. A dream. And I still imagine myself living in this dream for the whole next season. I really don’t know how she does it…

Well Medusa kicked ass, so you are in good company. The sweater is a dream, and yes layering can be a…well, anyway, great photos of the show!

Shirt and skirt Saint Laurent/Boots Celine/Sunglasses Ray-Ban.

Ph Timur Emek.

In collaboration with Luisa World.

None of the designers stirs our nostalgia for the past like Hedi. Into the seventies glam mood, his girls marched though a genius holographic rotating installation (which created myriad spots of rainbow light spinning around the black curtained walls) under  Aleide’s 1,2,3 uplifting beats. This was a show, drug for the tired souls. A show that left us with a cheeky smile and an unfulfilled wish: We wanted more! Yes, even first row’s stiffest legs were synchronically  moving with the rhythm. We all had a good time.The collection itself has been, per me, the sexiest ever the Historic house has presented. Breathtaking don’t-you-even-try-to-tie-alone-your-laces minis, cropped jackets, barely there shorts all modeled on his feminine army’s lean long stocking legs and their XL glittering seventies heeled sandals. A collection that left me wondering:

Will the scientists notice the sudden increase in the female population’s height? Because his sky-high heels will definitely sell out.

But where was Hedi ?

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Rumors of nasty winters have been greatly exaggerated. Winter is a wonderful thing. It’s the only season that I can dramatically layer piles of wools without complaining much. Don’t get me wrong, I adore wools, I just don’t get along well with layered cakes.  Winter came rather late to Paris this year. So the only time we could throw on us some lovin wool without getting unwanted rashes was when the sun was going to sleep. At the Parisian twilight, I wore one of my favorite outfits for this fashion week. From the stealthy grey pants to the understated brownish grey (that perfectly matched my skin’s pale colour) blouse, this shade symphony was like a multi-vitamin to my soul.   No, I am not trying to impress you by amplifying words, these are definitely not my intentions. For me feeling great in an outfit nurtures my soul, balances my aura, boosts my energy. You see it’s deeper than you think….

 

so perfect!

Isabel continues to be Isabel. Slouchy pants, toned shoulders and a super hot leggy army, in the sexiest ever flared minis. The coolest Marant girl was all over her latest collection. Not that I’m complaining, I am a big fan of everything she represents and I’m delighted to see her gracefully evolving. And by gracefully I mean that yes, she developes slowly her journey through fashion but one thing’s for sure, she is swimming upstream. This season the evolution came in the form of pleats. The flagship…that accordion skirt, that, I already know, will forever hunt my wish list.

The day of the show was freakin hot in Paris. I had originally planned, yes I plan my outfits during the fashion weeks, to wear my grey wool Celine pants that you will be able to witness on the next post but I have swapped them for these kinda airy cotton ones and guess what…they saved my day. Palais de Tokyo, the place of the show, is a beautiful space, has a unique façade but if you ask me, honestly is kinda unfit to demonstrate a collection during warm days. It’s a relatively small chamber, usually packed, inevitably turning into a sauna crisis when the catwalk’s lights turn on. Of course you can carry one of these portable hand-held fans but then again the question arises…Would it be chic?

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

I know, It’s hard to reminisce about the old days without iPhone yet weren’t they much easier? I’m experiencing an i-phone crisis people. A major one! The previous one had been stolen when in Paris, replaced by a brand-new one and now my shiny-precious-I-cannot-live without mobile doesn’t work. Kaput. I’ve tried to snap a juicy Pavlova and the screen got stuck on black.

-It might got choked by the calories. I phones are too chic for sloppy desserts…

Pfffff…. Dunno. I’ve just bravely saluted it and prayed for the quickest replacement. The positive thing, you see there is always a bright side, now that I don’t have the devil on hand to interrupt my focus, I can blog more. So  voila, the outfit that will probably be my winter armor. Mid lengths and high boots. But first, let me tell you a secret. If you are all into covering your legs while wearing long skirts or bermudas, you’d better start to wear heels. Because you know, sporting flat boots with mid-lengths, will inevitably tag you into the “Middle-Earth-Hobbits” category, thing that nobody wants to happen(before Christmas). Karlie Kloss is excluded. She always is :).

U manage to put all the hot new trends for this winter together (mid pants, turtle neck sweater, boots and of corse the amazing belt bag) and u look gorgeous bravo!!

You look stunning….like a model!!

This is probably one of your best outfits to date ! Love this so much, your Acne knit and your boots are wonderful !

On the pic, chit chattin with Irina.

Je suis très fatigué, I am very tired, French, English, whatever, the first thing being said though to every single taxi driver when in Paris. Not due to the fact that I was (literally) running late to most of the fashion week’s shows (the traffic was insane) but also because I wore heels! Heels are killers, in the very bad way.

This time, not wisely, I’ve convinced myself to follow my bestie’s advice and turn my back on flats.

-Darling flats are so last year…people will hate seeing you every single season in trainers and combat boots. Wear some heels please, be a woman for God’s sake!

And the result…..Bare foot on the Parisian streets. Yes I’ve done that. Not one of the ten things though I would suggest someone to do in life. You know… French smoke a lot…so you might step in some (unwanted) hotness. Let me rest for a bit guys…I’ve just returned from Paris and I will be back and hopefully very chatty…Meanwhile…I can hear you…ask…ask…what would you like to know?

Well-rested, your freshly returned sofa-champion gets finally chatty. Silence was not gold in our case and even though I love styling more than writing, the second one is the only way to communicate my Parisian this time not-so adventurous adventures. Not-so because during this fashion week I was a good girl…no parties, no drinks, not staying late at night. Almost a health junkie, after a quite nasty food poisoning just a day before I touched-down Paris . Those seven days were all about the shows and enjoying the designing houses’ creative grandeur.

For this season’s fashion marathon I’ve collaborated with Luisa World, the beloved department store that carries the majority of my sartorial wishes, in order to celebrate their brand new(and super cool if I may) blog. I’d taken over their instagram for the whole six days and nights. No, no, I’ve been honest with you, my night life was quiet yet some of the shows, like Lanvin for example did start after the last rays of the sun had set.

On the 25th of September, astrologically the best day of the year according to my friend Billy,  Alber Elbaz popped up the Champaign for the historic House’s 125 years anniversary by celebrating individuality. Yes, Elbaz’s simple lines of jersey, brocade shift and rose silk dresses or the minimal shapes of the shouldered jackets over pencil skirts and wide-leg pants had nothing to do with creating an impressive, out-of-the-ordinary collection. The epicenter of the show was the face. In particular the familiar faces of Amber Valletta, Kirsten Owen, Violetta Sanchez, Natasa Vojnovic , who were wisely chosen by the designer to prove that there’s nothing more beautiful than a woman who feels confident in simple, minimal lines. Simplicity is the greatest ability, Elbaz knows….we know.

 

 

 

125 is a long time! Lanvin has such an amazing history & Alber Elbaz is such a talented designer.

Forget about camouflage. Patterns are a past issue. All the young women soldiers who want to look cool have decided on upgrading themselves to the Special Forces Elite. That means no patterns should be used to survive the style-defence game. Special Forces’ uniforms are discrete, monochromatic and fierce. Because to be a real heroine you just have to be and feel strong and confident, not loud. Got it? If not, drop and gimme 50 push-ups. Let’s go!

You can never go wrong with an all black look.

Leather jumpsuit Heroine by Tom Wood(available in stores mid October)/Acne t-shirt/Adidas trainers, model code Samba(similar here)

Ph Jordan Makarof

Finally! From lookbook to reality. One of the best parts of creating magic. Because isn’t it magic when one of your thoughts comes alive?

So here I am dressed like a sexy mechanic ready to solve world’s style issues(well almost). The depicted jumpsuit, was actually my second design for Tom Wood (first one was my father’s shirt). I needed in my life a sleek all in one piece which with some styling additions could turn from sporty to a hell of a night-wear. A piece that actually brought me back to the days that all-in-one(s) were the biggest part of my mom’s wardrobe.

When I was a child, I was sitting for hours on the floor watching her getting ready. And mom was always super late, with my dad in the car furiously blasting the horn. His own way to speed her up yet a woman Aries easily adapts to ignore… Our weekends’ reality.

So Mrs Smyrniotaki had a massive collection of jumpsuits, all with huge golden buttons thought..It was late 80’s you see. Fashion was totally injected with blings and golden buttons were likely to be considered as a turn to minimalism.

As a consequence to the aforementioned history lesson I’ve been brainwashed. The jumpsuits became my lifetime obsession. No wonder why they were among the first clothes I’ve designed.

And now it’s live, I’m all ears…like?

I love your clothes for tomwood, I live in greece, where can I buy them?

Hi my dear. Thank you.
Please contact Tom Wood for all the points of sale.

But seriously, did you ever think that I would welcome back Autumn? Yes it’s still hot in here but we, the Greeks, are the children of summer and we actually still enjoy some spare sun-rays. You guys…I’m saluting my inspiration. Despite the temperatures, August was rather a frozen moth for me. It practically felt impossible to brainstorm anything. Maybe some evil planets had been squaring over my head for the whole moth, blocking thus my cosmic vibes…who knows. But I’ll be back, like another Arni (Schwarzenegger) ready to make some serious noise. However I can’t really sing say that I’m back to black. Because as you already might know I’m forever coupled with the darkest shade of all. A Morticia in rise. So welcome me back family, with my all-time favorite outfit. Le Smoking tuxedo .

Back and fourth like a ping-pong ball we go on this blog. But some of us we find it kinda amusing, exactly like the aforementioned game. So here I am again, virtually this time, strolling around the city of future. I don’t really mind the humidity, it actually opens up my pores and detoxifies my skin or the 70000 Singapore Dollars needed to obtain the licence to drive your car for ten years(yes you’ve heard well). I WANT Singapore to adopt me! Please do! I’ll be a good girl. I might start wearing some pink if you’ll ask it. As long I can wake up to this views every single day. Singapore is in my heart and every time I come back it’s always different. Better in a way. This city celebrates the miracles that humanity can make. And we really can. Just look around take a deep breath and think tha everything is possible…

And I wonder…Has fashion been (accidentally) channeling the typical Charlie Chaplin uniform or  it’s just that THE high-waist pants to fit on every single body have been miraculously discovered ? Who’s gonna answer? I….I will! I have mentioned too many times on my posts about the most-wanted leg elongators but never before there was the one to match with every single figure. The fan part is that until now, I’ve considered Marant to be the ultimate babe-maker designer but never a master of the looser shapes. Well I was wrong. Slouchiness in the most flattering way, was her evolution. And I love, love people who are discreetly evolving themselves. So here we go girls, put your winter net on, tie the highest you can your softest wool pants and you are ready almost for anything.

We do love great clothes, after all that’s why we’re all here. But if clothes could speak in common language, they’d tell you that they do unconditionally love a fit-body and even more a fit-mind.

My newest collaboration with Net-A-Porter was a challenge for me. A challenge to wake-up my body. Net-A-Sporter just on time for the fashion weeks has  launched the 7-day body reboot program, per me an absolutely genius program to feel strong like a heroine again.. You know a couple of weeks ago I was vacationing on the best spot on earth to be uber lazy. So I’ve returned kinda…disoriented…unfocused…jelly bean for god’s sake.

Net-a-porter’s 7 day body reboot was my rehabilitation.  A smart, no-time-consuming training and dietary program that made me feel awake again all of my forgotten muscles. Strength, mobility, intensity and restoration workouts coordinated with the most delicious-healthy menu. It was not easy…the first two days I was fantasizing myself walking down Jardin des Tuileries wearing hot-pants to stay focused. Yet trust me this program is genius and your body will eventually remember and master all the moves.

Now do tell me…I got my lines back, No?

Your exclusive guaranteed beautifying schedule is live now on Net-A-Sporter.

You can get my fitness uniform below:

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

Tote Smythson

Ph Alex F. Bag close-up by me.

I must have a packing syndrome. I honestly don’t know its name, yet there must be a word written about it in the psychology glossaries. That is when you pack your whole house, in the fear of missing something during your vacation. Yeap I’m a heavy-weight traveler. Except from one thing through: My bag. It is weird but when it comes to bags I try to take one (or maximum two with me) for all circumstances. From day to-night, to the beach or to our evening stroll. One hell of a multitasker. The “one”  that saved during my recent Southeast Asia trip was the depicted Smythson. A white large tote with a wave of canary-yellow inside, in other words a Kinder surprise. And you know how much I love surprises! Seriously!

 

We are in love with this bag!

Pretty bag!

I’m extremely proud to present to you my first capsule collection, I’ve designed for Tom Wood, the originally jewlery mega-brand which is now expanding to the clothing industry. My favorite Scandis will make their market debut with two lines: The namesake one, a men and women minimalistic collection and the Heroine by Tom Wood, 10 cleaned lined pieces that were always on the top of my wish list. 10 pieces that could be worn in multiple ways yet all destined to make us all feel comfortably confident.

So how have they all started…Well in May 2012 Mona Jensen, Tom Wood’s owner and creative director contacted me to design a jewelry line for her then soon-to-be launched brand. I felt really honored but not yet ready to design jewelry. However with clothes was another story. It’s something that probably in my genes. From age zero, it felt natural to design outfits. I had even created my own mini-line when I was in high school with a local seamstress. It was good I’m telling you, at least I had totally enjoyed it. So when we hooked up again with TW team during the last NY fashion week, as we were discussing of how much our fashion aesthetics do match up, they popped up the question to me: design my first capsule collection. As far as I remember it didn’t need that much time to decide. I was already a big fan of Tom Wood’s signet lines and the proposal was dreamy. Not  to co-design or just put my name on a label. To put my whole soul, the whole me. And I’m really so thankful for that. So thankful that Mona believed in me and trusted that we both, together, we could make a miracle happen. So here it is, the Heroine by Tom Wood, a collection of pieces that ALL have a story behind, stories that I will reveal one by one in the near future.

 

perfect, I want them all, please more photos!

Awesome collection!
You did an amazing job.

Yes, yes, I’m currently vacationing in a Malaysian paradise yet I don’t want to be a stranger. I’ll come back soon with whole of my adventures from the tropics. Meanwhile shoot me…where are you? Have you returned from holidays?

Haider Ackermann jacket(SS 13, found it at an insane sale price when in Departement Feminin)/Dries Van Noten shirt (similar here)/Mih-Jeans denim(new favorite)/Acne shoes/Jil Sander belt/Maison Mischel hat(same in grey also check this)

Now hear me out. I might not speak that loud during this Malaysian midnight yet I’ll try to be clear. There’s not any secret for turning the extreme frizzy dehydrated locks into straight ones(I adore straight hair) without using a dryer. We, the hair-balls, are on another level people. The medusa(s) level. Not any available technological advances are made for us yet. To be honest with you I have tried the Brazilian blow dry in the past but from shoulder and below…destruction…chaos…embers..do I need to say more? Plus If I haven’t already told you I’m hypochondriac and all these stories about the potential cancer risk had creeped me out. Just wear a hat girls. It works. Oh and straighten a bit your ends. It helps when you want to have a nice braid.

Enough with the hair-talk. Still in Malaysia, today we’ had our first burger! Don’t dare to judge me about my newscast! Life is pretty easy here. Not much drama..Well, except from the fact that my stomach is going to explode by the extensive use of Malaysian spices. Five days in a row are more than enough for my body’s, probably, most fragile area(my heart is excluded :p) . So the Pangkor Laut facilitates five restaurants with my favorite one, the Straits, a gourmet restaurant to dine in private booths literally on the rocks. A bit overpriced if you ask me, always judging by the Malaysian currency and the country’s economy. Apart from that the food was fab and the location insane!

You know the drill…it’s late..i have to go to sleep or else I might a need a helmet to look descent in the pics tomorrow….Goodnight…

Jumpsuit Current Elliott,(also here), size down, here on size 0(check it in denim)/Tee Acne(favorite basic)/Boots Chanel/bag Smythson/Mono-earring Louis Vuitton.

Outfit pics Alex F, the rest by me.

Two words with a tab in the middle: Recovery-mode. There must be a pill.. A pill that instantly vanish your jet lag. If it really exists and it’s not my wild imagination’s yet another product , I’d like to know it…please!

Thewhole following week we will be all passengers in time, when I’ll take you back to my then tropical state of mind. It was my seventh time in Singapore. Seventh, I cannot believe that I’m actually saying that number or that it has been my 11th anniversary with my husband. 11 years together and while for some might seem like a lifetime, for me it feels like yesterday. Time passes quickly guys. But what is really time?  I have convinced myself that is just a human invention existing to stress us and put us in “boxes”. Can you imagine your life without the significant  existence of the time counter? Life as it supposed to be. Measured with feelings.

I suppose that all being mentioned above are obviously the side effects of my jet-lag. Anyway back at that day in Singapore and my usual habit to wear jumpsuits. Logically you’ll ask me:

Is n’t it too warm to wear in Singapore?

May I  answer with a question? Have you ever been inside a building in Singapore? The cold is insane. It’s like a local conspiracy to have the A/C on the skin-preserving-mode. Zero celsius that is. No joke. Thus these cotton Current Elliott all-in-ones were somehow  perfect for the circumstance. And while struggling to preserve my body temperature, I’ve unexpectedly found my number one wish on my fall list. It seems that they’d stocked earlier that the other capitals and the Louis Vuitton mono-earring was surprising available. Available and light-weight! Yes!!  My ears won’t suffer for fashion. Actually that’s partially true because my earring hole was closed in the back and my suffering while attempting to reopen it was insane. I had almost forgotten how massive the piercing pain was. And I have 10 ear holes, I should have known better(obviously the 8 of them closed)! While the salesman was watching me with terror, almost to bend the earring, he had the brilliant idea to bring over another pair of studs that could help for a better ear-drilling. After endless ear poking with a few breaks to pray….well that was it…the studs saved the day…

 

 

 

Congrats on your anniversary with your husband! LOve a good jumpsuit, Current/Elliott sure makes the best ones, so easy and yet not easy to pull it off so beautifully!

I believe in magic. Yes, I do. In the good one. And so it is. As I’ve already told you, I’ve been dreaming of this. I’ve been dreaming to be as awesome as it looks on its website’s pics. Because, you know, the real thing sometimes differ from the images. In our case, thank god, what you see is what you get. Pangkor Laut is beautiful. The private island reminds me a mix of “Lost” and “Blue Lagoon”. A two million years old rain forest, coupled with rocky outcrops and white powdery beaches. Our room is an over water villa. Trust me, sleeping under the wave sounds is the best remedy for the jet lag. Better than xanax. After all the previous introduction I can imagine that you’d like to see current neighborhood. No? My natural environment if I may…don’t you remember?! I’m a Pisces, a fishie.:)

More stories in the near future…for now…well the waves have already drugged me. Good night….

Color quizzes and color trivia. In continue to my inability to set a description for complicated colors, I call the entire universe, not to judge me, but to help me… What is that? Is it like a dead vintage salmon? Old powder? Dirty nude? How would you describe the color for the depicted clutch? Let the fashion-brains conference to declare a verdict and I am ready to accept it. Nevertheless, after (my soft spot) burgundy, it makes a hell of contrast/match with black…No?

Drop and give me 50. My brain’s fitness programs are expanded to my abs for this fall and that’s just because I love to show them! A legal exhibitionist in high rise. Thought my early(trust me, you don’t want to catch the cold in the stomach) fall’s favorite mix, needs the most intelligent pants to be succesful. Pants that are high enough to give you the present of the long legs you’ve always wanted and not too tight around the waist, to avoid giving you the present of the belly-pillow you never wished for. And these ones are perfect. Hedi knows….Really knows how to transform the basic high-waist trousers into these flawless silhouette’s accelerators.  The pants we all need to have in our wardrobes.

Ph Sara Perringerard for Departement Feminin.

All black everything and me in the middle of a sci-fi scene at the “Les Abattoires” Museum or in simple English, Toulouse’s Modern and Contemporary Arts Museum. That night the exhibits on display, thank god, did not come to life… there were some pretty scary mummies on the upper floor. Joking guys. Yes the mummies did exist yet f I had to say something for that day, I’d say that I felt extremely honored that “Les Abattoires” had opened its gates for us, to shoot for Departement Feminin. It was Monday and the museum was as it should be in a day that is close to public. Calm and quiet. When wandering through its world of corridors though, I could feel the chills from the impact of standing alone in front of the exhibits’ impeccable beauty. Chills that I’ve never felt before…. One of the times that you take a deep breath and be thankful for that enormous joy your job has given you.

I miss the days that you showcased more range in shade and color–all these all-black outfits are feel unimaginative and monotone!

These pics are true works of art !

It’s insane how everything you wear is ultimately perfect !

I had no idea but Batman’s other winged-half actually exists. No it’s not me, stop poking me…..I’m just an all grown up butterfly.

Capes as I’ve already mentioned, are all over the place for this Fall, last fall and probably the next one…When challenged at Departement Feminin to find my favorite pieces for the chilly-season, the depicted Valentino outerwear was my first choise. Not that I’m into trends that much yet this cape is a stunning piece in its own simplicity. Soft and warm with a hidden intelligent mystery, made for a rather contemporary femme-fatale in disguise. J’adore!

The cape is to die for!

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

A short lesson, monotone is a Greek word meaning dull and tedious. In our case though, I’d prefer to keep the English interpretation, “a continuing sound” that is . The sound of colors. Of course the colors have sound, don’t you ever hear them? Alarming red, canary yellow, ocean blue…all in the great symphony of senses.

And how’s grey’s sound dear?

Well for the past two years, when pronouncing the “G” word, the entire universe  simultaneously gets an earful from the lively Christian Grey’s naughty room. I’ve made your day!? Do tell!

So back to Department Feminin, the pink city(Toulouse’s nickname) and the depicted outfit, a beautiful symphony of four shades of grey. A mix that can be worn from day, if you add a pair of white Eytys sneakers, or on a night out with the above sexiest Celine snake skin sandals. I really have a soft spot for these kind of outfits. The all-day, all-weather, easy-going, not-much-to-think-about outfits. Because when you already have a million things in your mind, versatile-dressing might be your savior…

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.






 

 Celine dress/Boots Chanel.
Ph Sara Perringerard for Departement Feminin.
I am the only one who actually thinks that the shape of this dress, highly resembles to the otherwise cute animal? Armadillo(yes) and my imagination obviously went wild in the French Country side. French Champagne and fromage, a combination that seriously brought some light fizz to my brain cells.

So back to the Mediterranean coast and totally sober :), we cut the ribbon of my new collaboration with my beloved on-line shop Département Féminin with Phoebe’s slickest dress, a silky armor shell, a shameless show stopper, if I may…Even though the word “princess” is almost banned from my style vocabulary, you have to admit it… Don’t I look like a runaway one? This dress, I’m telling you is an endangered species, a really rear one and per me the best piece of Philo’s pre-fall collection. J’ adore!

Nice dress!!!

Well, who said that the armadillo can’t be a princess? At least some kind of…;)
This dress is really unusual and unique (I like both of those words, couldn’t decide on one…), totally made for you:)

And another dream collaboration, congratulations! I can’t wait to see more.

I’ll better start introducing my self, well(if you don’t already know) I’m Evangelie, a Greek born Pisces, which automatically means two things for me: One is that I love the sea ( it’s in my genes) and two…the sea loves me back(it’s written in my stars). So I couldn’t help but to choose  my favorite sport , swimming, a sport that apart from a healthy body gives me a piece of mind, in order to celebrate Net-A-Porter ‘s newest family member Net-A-Sporter. A whole new era dedicated to the strongest girls who need to sport in style. Well, we all do need an excuse to start working out  and….we’ve just found it. Swimwear, trainers, dance clothes, running pants, made to not only perform but also to stun. Enjoy super heroines!

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

Earth calling!!!!!
Yes, she’s alive!!!!!
After a series of misfortunes during my first day in Paris(my Iphone was stolen at Galleries Lafayette), Paris Haute Couture evolved as it’s suppose to be, magnificence in grandeur. Because where else do you get THAT glamour except Paris HC week?
Caught just before(and after) the magical Elie Saab show, fully clad in my protection suit against the witchery Paris rain, seeking the answer to: Does the French capital have a tropical rainforest climate? Monsoons hit the city and it hadn’t stop raining cats and dogs.
On another note the Elie Saab show itself was gorgeous. Under a sky of luminous chandeliers, voluminous silhouettes of exquisite craftmanship. Pearls and amazing chiffons to turn every frog to a….modern beautiful princess :).

You can see my report from Paris here.

A kiss only in words, is not another empty promise. On the contrary. I totally adore you. It’s just that I’m a bit shy when it comes to express my feelings. It’s a work in progress though, so I might surprise myself in the near future.

Back in Toulouse for a couple of days for a shoot-extraordinaire with my favorite people from Département Féminin, simultaneously discovering a) that stripes actually do work with the French country side and b)Toulousian coffee unexpectedly keeps you forever alarmed. Bip Bip.

You know what they say, “There’s a first time for everything.” Indeed my friends, despite having considered myself a red opponent for as long as I can remember, depending on my “homemade’ theory that my pale skin unfavorably reacts to anything flashier than it, during the dress fittings at the Valentino’s head-quarters, I fell in love with an alien that depicted red. Sock! First it was brown and now red! And then what? The evolution of change applicable to my own brain cells? Naaaaaaaa…as I’ve told you in a previous post, again, everything in life is about giving chances, be open-minded and realize the Valentino’s red is “the one and only red”.

A big thank you to the Valentino team who have made this Haute Couture week so special for me and honored me by watching live their absolutely heart pounding collection of craftmanship.
You can see my full report on Paris Haute Couture here.

This dress is fabulous! And you make it look even better. What a relief that you wore it with boots, not heels;) Really, stunning look.

You may not believe me, but (Valentino’s) red is definitely your color:)

I might believe you….hehehehe! Thank you darling <3

Perfect in this red dress, so gorgeous

Fashion has no rules. Rules are for the Navy and as far it concerns me, I always get seasick. Ahoy sailor!!! Naaaa, if only the mere thought of cruising  seas sends my stomach lurching, can you really imagine a reality check?

So I had this Chloe knitted dress that could only be worn with its vicious V happily pointing at your toes (as Clare Waight Keller had originally in mind) only a: If you were Rihanna or b: if you could layer it. You know that between layering and me, there’s no romance so my latest habit took over. Turned it around and I like it it worked!  So why to bother with lookbooks and style rules? My spinal claimed its freedom and Chloe’s perfect tailoring, gave it back! Woot woot, “free the back”, a thought that I also have kept in mind during the whole designing process of my first capsule collection…More on this soon, so soon.

 

Rihanna queen.

The dress is to die for!

As previously refered, all aid to the most-wanted freedom of our….hands. First the banana and now the bucket bag. So what’s the hype with the bucket bags lately? Well except from the fact that they are back on the road to the trend-mountain, most of them also have super wide straps to be safely worn cross-over your body. I deliberately say safely because when their belt is thin, the bag might end up freely moving like a cow’s bell and we don’t want that…no?

Stop squeezing your belly button. Fashion dictates the pants that will automatically do that for you. I warn you thought. It’s nothing like the much-loved feeling of comfort of the old boyfriend pants. Nevertheless you’ll have legs for miles and your tiny waist will certainly be reclaimed. Let the tall-limb makers take us all high…

I always love photos from backstage, especially when they come out as an editorial;) good job!

As I reminisce my past, brown (alongside yellow) was rather my most hated colour. Not even furniture close to that shade have been allowed to enter my house. However about a year ago, during a drooling excursion over Balenciaga shop, I came across with the aforementioned colour disguised in a jacket. The (until that day) blah factor hadn’t turned down my curiosity and in a what-the-heck moment I’ve tried it out. TA DAAA! That was it! All my past theories had fallen apart like a sandcastle. Brown did look well with my brunette head, in fact really well. I’ve misjudged! I’m guilty! Sue me! I don’t know if the fault is in my stubborn nature that it has been banned from my existence. In a matter of fact there must be also others than me out there, that’s why brown so hard to find, no?

Imagineeee, brown its a amzing color.Always think about this, all colors are betiful and my favorites.Xxx from Brazil.

Evangeline you look adorable

We all have these colours we simply cannot abide, for me it’s purple, but again, yes, I am sure one day it will become desirable for me too…

Thankfifi

love this simply white outfit you are perfect on it for this summer xoxo

Like I’m reading my own story. Yellow and brown also always been my most hated colors (seeing them put together could literally burn my eyes or at least cause anaphylactic shock). Worse than looking like a huge walking canary or a jar of mustard can be only to look like… a poop. Because in my experience, that’s the thing about brown – it usually looks like a poop. And then I found out it’s (obviously) all about a shade. The perfect shade of brown may be the most beautiful way to highlight the beauty of brunettes and lightly tanned skin… But yeah, who cares about their beauty, let’s we all make it soo hard for them to find brown not looking like a poop. (so sorry I talk so much, I’m such freaking storyteller)

Your hat and the whole look is stunning, but Evangelie, you have really beautiful hair color! So deep and warm shade… and lighter ends look amazing:) It makes me want to darken my light brown..

You are an incredible story teller Izabel! Poop is the right word!ahahaha
Ah i am just a step from getting blonde. I think when I’ll be off to NY I’ll try it. I was once you know. But then too much maintenance and even more destruction. But now I’m ready to live with the mess again;)

And I really wonder, are we, the sassy Greeks, the only ones in the planet who shamelessly pronounce the belt pouches as BANANAS?! I hope not, so you my preciosas, to be able to link somehow the tittle with the image without speculating that after Milan I just went BANANAS. Either way, my magic foggy sphere mysteriously predicts that the aforementioned outfit divider(obviously that’s the cause the depicted belt serves) will be a huge trend. The “look mum no hands” expression in a completely different demonstration. No bicycle needed.

Back in Milan’s steamy streets just an hour before the Stella McCartney Spring15 presentation, dressed in the most comfort way, a jumpsuit that is. This Italian city doesn’t come easy with summer. That translates into heat and mosquitoes, a terribly nasty combination for sweetblooded girls like me. I did saved my hands though from a dot-ed disaster yet that did not applied on my legs. I still have the marks of Milan on my limbs but I also have another ones, those forever kept in my brain cells. Memories…

The Stella McCartney Spring15 presentation took place at “Orto Botanico” the botanic gardens, as the name implies, by the side of Bvlgary hotel. From a distance, the dramatic entry with Stella’s flowered-pink letters, the long fenced lush plants complex and the scattered candle lights made me think of a countryside party. But once I stepped through the last bushes the true “spirit” of the evening showed up. McCartney’s models impeccably dressed with the designer’s spring 15 collection, cheerfully interacting with the crowd. I seriously love this new coolness of presenting collections. It’s like a refuge from the metal glare of the cities. Some precious moments, quality if you may, to indulge into the fresh collection. The outfits themselves were absolutely beautiful. McCartney’s heroines, superheroes was actually this season’s theme, were strong yet fragile. Feminin yet a bit boyish. But above all they were happy, happy girls in their clothes’ absolute comfort. As we all should be.

Let my paparazzi skills speak for themselves.

 

ah those mules are just perfection <3

Fashion is indeed a damn clever lil brat whose brain-cells with just pure mathematics can produce real miracles. For example, using the old-school plus minus formula (plus volume, minus length), solved the how-to-have-giraffe’s-legs equation in a glimpse of an eye. In simple english try any of high-waisted boxy cropped pants and your limbs will totally resemble with Giselle’s. That easy, no spells, no chinese medicine needed….

The aforementioned sweatshirt on another adventure, strategically chosen to cover up my precious assets. On the bottom line(literally) It’s hard to get the perfect length-ed top. No?

Really enjoy your blog, always editorial but also real. Would you mind sharing what size the sweater is?

Hi Adriana,
I got it in large.
xoxo

Well, the point of view depends on the point of the seat 😀 With my 5’2″ it’s not that difficult, honestly, sometimes it’s pain in the ass that everything is sooo long. But beyond that you are absolutely right! Sometimes even when the length is good, the shape sucks.

That being said, the sweatshirt is perfect and it’s really great idea to wear it with feminine lace skirt.

totally true! The shape is so hard to find. Btw have you see the Acne fall sweatshirts?
Gorggggg

Yesss and I fell in love with them! Acne never disappoints 🙂

 




I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

ph Jordan Makarof

Well it’s true. An unfortunate true. Key pieces are hard to find out there. Versatile pieces that can do miracles,that will easy balance out patterns, colours, statement mega-hits and “another stories”. Per me, the devoted to black supremacy girl, the depicted sweatshirt from By Malene Birger is my gal pal, twinsie, soul sista, in common language my ever favorite one. I wear it in very high rotation, on and on, until eventually will suddenly get melted….For a proof of my words there will be another post to follow….

 

The perfect combination for a chilly summer day…

In Love with the skirt

Hi Evangelie, even though the pieces you are wearing are high quality, this combo is not flattering in my opinion.
Keep up with good work. 🙂

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?
I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside.

Chloe bazer, shorts and shoes(here and here, my current obsession)/Celine bag, check out this great alternative(available at Luisa World)/Linda Farrow sunglasses/Tom Wood signet.

Ph Jordan Makarof

Shorts with shirts, without, loose boxy jackets just to cover them or elegantly tucked in like the depicted one. So what your preferences say about you?

Let me guess…If you go for the version, jacket for top, you probably have no boobs like your sassy bestie….me! Unfortunately this staple piece of wardrobe wasn’t made to bare-worn and It is not soft enough to stay on put on curves, avoiding unwanted vulgarity. So I consider we are on the same boat under this much-revealing preference theory.

Then…if you tuck it in your shorts….hmmm, you are in need for dance! It’s the very stable version of the aforementioned saga for your happily ever after no-need-to-get-famous tatas! Let’s dance…common…….

Love the bag! It’s gorgeous

My second favorite saga, after GOT.

Funny, because until now I thought that I have too small boobs (actually don’t have them at all, but ok) to wear deep necklines and jackets as tops. But from now on I will bravely go in this direction! 🙂

You look absolutely perfect! I fell in love with your style and this outfit is my favorite *_*

Ph Jordan Makarof

That day Jordan had questioned himself:

a: where was our camel ride?

b: why I was wearing heels in the desert?

c: if dune bashing with jeeps makes me sick from nausea. 

For the “c” the answer is a big, fat, shameless yes. Terribly yes. If you seat by me, you’re in danger yes. I-only-do-it-with-an-anti-nausea pill yes.

For the others….dears, this is not a safari session’s look. It’s just a very alternative office look. On the bottom line button up and the “alternative” addition will be vanished.

By the way, next time I’ll make sure I AM the one sitting in the front to Jeep. Now who wants to invite me to Dubai? I am obviously ready!


Lovely! loving the skirt and mules!

If the subtitle says nothing and you are lost in translation maybe you’ve never tasted THAT. The mega-reason that my husband wants to get the first plane back to California. So what’s DAT got to do with an outfit post? Simply nothing. It’s just one of the endless games my playful mind. My hopping mind. From one thing to another and back. So In N’ Out originally characterized the state of my shirt. Two outfits with just one simple shirt-tucking. What’s best? It doesn’t matter. As long as your shirt doesn’t crumples, the combinations are practically endless….

 

Great look, love this shorts

Here’s a quick lesson on how to greet in Norway: Hei x 2, which apparently sounds like hei hei :). Greet them with a smile yet rarely with a kiss. Cheek kiss is quite uncommon, a lesson learned by me, the sassy Greek, after I’ve experienced the total horror in their eyes when I’ve dragged them for a kissieeeeeee. What can I say, on my next visit you should send me a manuscript before I embarrass myself on “I wanna hug him and squeeze him and call him George” situation. It’s not my fault…it’s my genes!

I’m just joking guys, I think that the Norwegians actually enjoyed the new weirdo in town….me.

-So tell us girl, what brought you to Oslo eventually?

Beat the drums……pop up the champaigns….here comes the revelation:

I am working on my first ready-to-wear capsule collection. I am collaborating with the super succesful Scandinavian jewelry brand Tom Wood for the totally designed by me 2014-15 winter collection. Till now it’s an absolutely exciting, most of the times emotional process, such stuff as dreams are made of.

And the name… Heroine by Tom Wood.

Stay tuned…(cliche)

In continue to my previous monologue, don’t ever let anyone fool you, stretch marks DO NOT fade away with creams. I’ve dealt with it and spent literally the value of one month’s trip  to Kuda Huraa on them. They’re still there saluting you from the depths of my shorts. Anyways…let’s talk about something happier like dead eagles hanged on chests. Common…have some faith on me, I’m not some kind of a pevert. I just write what I see. My necklace is obviously an eagle, it’s not moving thus it’s dead and even though I have tiny boobs you can see that It still ends lower on my chest. Yet another great trend to come that you’ll remember my sweetest voice telling you:

Told you so!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ph Jordan Makarof

You may have noticed that I have an ongoing fling with toned shoulders. What you probably don’t know is that none out there does them better than Isabel Marant.

Actually I have convinced myself that they illusionary add the much wanted 10 cm to my tiny (wannabe swimmer’s) shoulders. My poor mom obviously knew that someday I would have wished a more toned upper body and urged me to be more active. And I was…hyper-active, on eating. This was the way my little brain had interpreted her command resulting very muscled…Jaws…. Yeap, during my childhood I was a hairy ball. Hairy because I hadn’t experienced lasers yet and my mom didn’t want me to shave my legs until high school (still I don’t quite know the reason) and ball because I was overweight. An overweight sortie. And just like that around the age of 13, a miracle did happen. I suddenly grew taller and surprisingly thinner. The aftermath was some really nasty stretch marks but…who cares…the boys all of a sudden had noticed me! 😉


Absolutely love the look!

Beautiful vest!
http://www.stylespectra.blogspot.com

Amazing editorial and the whole look! You became my number one fashion blogger.

Ahahaha! My father was quite liberal regarding my dressing, acting, choosing etc but he didn’t let me pierce my ears. When i did it at last at 16, he was devostated (and furius) for a week. 

I am sure you were a cute “hairy ball”. Oh, and you rock the brogues situation on all of your related posts.

 





Burbery Prorsum trench(size up, too small)/Valentino headband(also available at LuisaWorld)/Celine lace-ups(similar here).

Ph Jordan Makarof

That day everything seemed to be uncomfortably wrong…a very annoying 3D fever(I mean 3-day not some kind of an alien one) did continue to harass my always fragile nervous system – don’t you dare raise your voice to me, I’ll probably (and literally) kick your ass – the walls were burning by a weirdly hot early May sun and last but not least for some still unidentified reason the whole city center had lost power, blocking me behind the garage door…Yet when everything seems to be going against you (“remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it” Henry Ford) go to your wardrobe, grab your favorite piece and get done shot with it (a clueless blogger’s quote).

So If you knew me better you’d definitely had acknowledged by now that I am not a very lace person. I did convinced myself though, that the depicted Burberry Prorsum trench was just another perforated awesomeness. Because you know, brains are pretty much talkable and if you are a little persuasive, they might believe it. Anyways it’s not the first time(and certainly not the last) that I wore a trench for a dress (specially during my nasty early spring mornings). They are easy, flattering, understated sexy. Not to mention that with the appropriate fabric could be evolved to a hell of a masterpiece. A “one of a kind” thing, a head turner, a dream-maker. Don’t get me wrong… just get the look and then we’ll all be happy on a weird May-day! 🙂

Stunning Look! Everything is so perfect.

 


I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?

I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

An alternative title could certainly be “never say never” yet never in fashion is a bit overrated:)

Yes, you probably didn’t know it but I graphic t-shirts were not exactly my thing. But tell me something, who could actually resist to Ann Bancroft’s sassy limb? I couldn’t….Hoffman couldn’t. You?

 

 

perfect outfit, that tee is too cute.

This is so cool and fresh! Not to mention that the t-shirt is a badass 😉

Altuzarra skirt, size 36(here and here)/Custom made shirt/Maison Martin Margiela necklace(also here), M size/The Row clutch/Tom Wood pinkie/Dior pumps.

Ph Jordan Makarof

Don’t you all aim for comfort when dressing? Well I do! I have that super weird syndrome, when wearing something tight around my ribs I get a back-pain. Am I the only one out there?

Anyway I am not sure that Altuzarra did have the comfort factor in mind when designing his latest S/S collection yet the evenings got real airy. And what I love most is that towelling effect. Super loose textiles wrapped around the waist and totally summery slim red zigzag stripes running down on the softest cotton. A breezy Carribean night…you do feel it no?

You can see the whole feature on Harper’s Bazaar US here.

That skirt is a beauty as are you!

 Haider Ackermann Jumpsuit, size 34(here and here)/Ann Demeulemeester trainers/The Row clutch/Tom Wood pinkie.

Ph Jordan Makarof

Something old, something new, something blue?! Naaaaa, not any good comes by adding the aforementioned shade near my face.

At last styleheroine.com is fully operational and I can gladly present to you one by one the outfits from my most favorite so far editorial. As you might already know the “challenge” was to demonstrate my life in three looks for Harper’s Bazaar US. And what’s better than a jumpsuit to make the introductions? I am literally(and clinically) obsessed with the all-in-ones and if I had an infinite budget I’d probably have bought the entire global jumpsuit production. I blame genes and more specifically my mother who she equally loves them. She blames my inherited boredom to mix and match. So that’s why layering is not quite my thing….More match…got it?

You can see the whole feature on Harper’s Bazaar US here.

 

Love your nail polish color! Can you share the name and brand?

Hi Karen it was Shelac i think the shade Merlot❤️

Thanks! Will request it for my next manicure

Trend, trend, trend…

Oh stop it..is it necessary to fry ours ears with that annoying alarm?

-Of course it is. You’ll witness it massively next season and then you’ll complain that I haven’t informed you.

So here I am, with my scarf wrapped highest than ever strutting up a down like a peacock, demonstrating my favorite upcoming trend.  Straight from the runways the thick scarves will do wrap around a major part of our upper body, making things a bit sexier per me…undercovered sexy… Who’s there?? Let me see….

sigh…what i wouldn’t do to trade closets for a day (week?  month? forever?!) with you!
the scarf is ahh-mazing!  and no one can style it better then you…so pretty as always!

question about the saint laurent booties–not sure how much you’ve worn them so far, but are they comfortable and do you find them stretching at all?  after putting in a few calls to my favorite nyc shops the past month, i finally got a call from one that they found a pair in my size..well, sort of–they’re a 40, i’m usually a 40.5…they reasonably fit albeit a tad snug in the toe box.  wondering if i should suck it up and keep them in the hopes they’ll stretch or pass em up and fingers crossed a larger size comes my way?

thanks!  and sorry for chewing off your ear 🙂

erm..i’m an idiot!  after writing that long-winded plea, i clicked on your link above…matches has my size!  

sorry…disregard above…i’m ordering 40.5 and feeling like a fool for not clicking your link in the first place!!
xx 🙂

you are hilarious my darling❤️ you are definitely gonna love them and they are so damn comfy.
xoxo

That last photo is so beautiful babe… AND you have the scarf!! Wooohooo

Xx

ahahahha❤️❤️❤️I am dreaming NY with you❤️❤️❤️❤️

Such a great look! Love love love that scarf!

Happy Easter you lil bunnies. Where do I find you? I’m currently pigging at my family house, enjoying the traditional festivities with a mama bear who daily cooks like she wants to feed a whole army. So let’s all celebrate the occasion with( no I’m not gonna use the cliché sparkling) the best fitting pants ever….while we can still fit. Oh have I just done the rime thing?…Dude who could tell…

I’m trying to decide which I love more – the pants or the fringed Valentino clutch – together they look AMAZING.

*Stands for chic.

Trivia of the day: Why they do find men in uniform so attractive? And the most crucial question, does the same apply to women?

If yes then I’ve made myself totally irresistible in a half surgeon attire. And I say half because my lower part resembles to a sassy amazon woman ready to wipe out of existence every singe male chromosome. No, no,no, please don’t worry, (for now)genetic genocide will be certainly avoided. The doctor inside has been taking me over. By the way have I ever mentioned that when in high school, I had been  studying to be a good Samaritan doc? Yet life, as always, had different plans.

Love it !

Beat the drum! Pop-up the champaigns! Styleheroine got a facelift! At last. We needed it somehow, to go with the flow, don’t you think?

So this is the new me, a new(per usual) minimalistic me yet flourished with more categories and eventually more posts to be inspired. We are not 100% ready but you can have a taste for things to come.

And what a better way to celebrate than a US Harpers Bazaar editorial! My life is demonstrated by 3 looks in a massive photo-feature as well as by Kerry Pieri’s coolest questions.

You can enjoy my favorite ever editorial here.

Thank you Harper’s Bazaar team and especially Kerry. I LOVE you.

 

Love your new “look”, especially the maintaining minimalistic design part.  This approach truly highlights you and your style (no clutter).  🙂

Congrats on the editorial.  HB US knows talent when it sees one (in you).   You have what it takes to be a dark Kate Moss.  If Kate made it at 5’7″, you can, too.

Thank you so much!!!xoxoxo

Bravo theaaaaa!!!!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

You get the resemblance, no? Inspired or not by the Greek inheritance, Phoebe is undeniably the master of pleats. Pleats that act like an autonomous organic creature, ready to fly with every corner you turn.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo.

slightly off topic but…
i’m catching up a pile of sunday NY Times (mostly the sunday styles section!) and i’m about 99% sure there’s a shot of you at paris fashion week in Bill Cunningham’s ‘on the street’ weekly section!  you’re wearing a black mesh sleeved saint laurent dress and ann d. combat boots…stunning!  and i’m super jealous–i’ve not-so-secretly always hoped i’d open the sunday papers one day and see myself in bill’s column!  

in case i’m not repeating old news and you didn’t catch it, it’s the october 27th paper (yes, i’m pathetically that far behind in newspaper reading…i don’t even bother with the actual news sections at this point!)

and back to this blogpost…love it!  classic white button down, leather trousers and cool-as-heck trainers??  perfection!

(ps. the dog is added bonus! :))

Omg I have never seen it! How can I find this pic? Do you have an idea? :))))

et voila! does this link work?:

i think that’s you in the shot right below the written text in the center!

Yes it works and yes it’s me :)))
Thank you my love❤️

anytime!  

a family friend was randomly photographed by cunningham years ago (wearing a pucci dress and crossing 5th ave in nyc!)–she had the newspaper page framed and hung it in her bathroom! so cool…you should totally frame it too–bill c. is the original sartorialist in my book! 🙂

Awesome outfit!
And the dog is too cute.

As you may have witnessed I keep things triplicated* so much that I’ve decided to create a brand new category on styleheroine, the triplettes, or simpler the way I most adore to wear colors. In three. No more, no less. The mix of just three shades of the endless color palette. For example in the depicted “under house” arrest outfit, it’s the symphony of black(of course, it’s always about the black), white and a pop of yellow. That’s it. And honestly I always find it sooooo exciting to break the balanced relationship of a colour couple with a joyful intruder. In the past it was the camel, the red , or even recently the pleated white. Let’s sum them up and kinda box them…What?! You don’t understand? Patience, things will change on styleheroine….

It’s almost Saturday and my week with Jimmy Choo slooooowly comes to an end. As a matter of fact we have one more to go. And this time I won’t be alone. I’ll be accompanied by someone hairier than me. Yeap you heard well, before technology had been hit Athens and the dearest laser torched my mammal fur, I was the distant cousin of Slash. Now everything goes smoother, I have moved out to the Bald Mountain and I have happily embraced the naked side of life. Oh, how intimate is too intimate?

Did you get to choose which pair of shoes you want to showcase?  If so, I love your pick on this one pair in particular.  I am a sucker for loafers.  This pair is just about being perfect.  And your mile-long legs are perfect to showcase the loafers.  🙂

Aww thank you Serena. Yes i have chosen everything by myself. And these ones are sooo comfy:))

You how it goes, fourth day happily ever feet-ed. What you probably don’t know is that every single year, for all of its 365 days I’m obsessed with one thing in my wardrobe, which my brain cells have already matched it with my entire closet. Last year were my Ann D. combat boots, two years ago my Anine bing black shirt and now the depicted Isabel Marant top. When I’ll reach to the point of layering it over my knits in winter then my condition will be serious.

I remain in good-Jimmy Choo-company for the second day, this time with a pair of understated sexifiers. Yes understated because cropped booties never had the very nasty reputation of the killer skyscraper-ed heeled pointy toes yet they can be a major elongator for your limbs and eventually a mega eye magnet. All that happens if the shoe maker has geniously cropped them just above the ankle. For the rest you’ll probably end up looking like a compressed giraffe.

Cheers to life-lessons.

They say “It’s not the destination, but the journey”. Well I….disagree and please read my lips because I’m gonna whisper you… it’s about everything!! From the packing preparations, to consider the airport outfit, from the instant excitement when stepping into the terminal, to the major thrill when you reach your destination. Every single moment when you travel is just awesome! I will never forget guys the feeling when the plane landed at Bora Bora, the last destination of my honeymoon. That feeling when you are officially in paradise, no sins attached, facing the glittering waters of an emerald lagoon and a mountain  rising dramatically out of the ocean as if by magic.  That feeling was everything.


Common factor to all these moments: A bag! A savior! Not backpack, no, no I am a backpacking failure. A tote. I always rely on a statement tote as my travel must-have. A super stylish yet comfortable to carry piece. So you can imagine how friggin excited I was when I got my hands on that Smythson bag. The grey-elephant Panama tote. A real beauty. The double joy came when I’ve noticed that the inspired by the legendary Panama diaries ultra clean shaped Smythson piece was also customized with my golden initials! Aaaaand…..here is your surprise…one of them CAN BE YOURS!!!! Don’t you just love me? You only need to follow the below super easy steps:

– Go to MyTheresa.com and the Smythson product page.

– Choose your favorite product.

– Click on one of the following social media chanel, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+ or email on MYTHERESA page and share why you love it, using the #LovePanama.

THAT’S IT! The bag can be yours. Monogrammed! There will be also a second prize a Smythson notebook and a third, a Smythson card holder. The winner will be announced on April the 2nd!

Good luck!

 

 

 

I’m beyond excited that I won this competition! I feel so lucky, and I’m glad you shared this and gave me the chance to win it. Can’t wait to receive my own Panama tote!

Congrats!!!!! I am really so happy for you! Enjoy it Camilla, it’s fantastic!!!!

I swear I fell in love with this bag. I fell for a bag, that’s just great… 😀 As a simplicity lover and a huge fan of gray I must say, this tote has the perfect shade! And it’s a TOTE. Oh no, my love is even bigger now… Of course I already gave myself a try in this giveaway 😀

Moving on, you look stunning as always girl 🙂 All black really suits you. Ok, move on to the next post to give you more compliments 😉

What a gorgeous bag (and lovely outfit to match)! I’ve loved their notebooks and journals for as long as I can remember. Not that I can afford them, but they’re nice to look at.

The rest by me.

19 days later, one year older, stitched and definitely wiser. No, no, cockiness is not my new trait, it’s actually old, and it’s cool, yes you’ve heard that from me, it’s cool to be a damn cocky peacock as long you are not rude. Because rudeness is a weak imitation of strength and, remember? We are heroines. Supergirls. Super-powered 🙂


Leaving the lessons behind, the depicted blanket-ed me was enjoying all the glory of the comfortable dressing during the fashion week’s most horrible storm. And if fashion weeks resemble to weddings, that means (very)high heels and flashy attires, I’ve decided instead opting for survival. That day it was not raining, it was storming! The Tuileries were transformed into a muddy mess of colorful ponds and the happy couple (Charlotte and I) was continuously trying to hope over them like another Kermit. The Elie Saab show was surely our shelter, or better our Oasis. The designer this year used my favorite color hues of emerald-green, burgundy and of course black for his creations, a certainly hard-to-resist collection for our next winter. This season also has marked something of a change for the designer. The bags. Opulent colored in clean geometric shapes with luxurious chain straps. The bags themselves looked absolutely fantastic. And due to the fact that I had the honor to be presented by Elie Saab with an emerald-green before the show, cross my heart guys, I swear, they also feel so, soooo damn good.


The pictures were taken after the storm show by Timur Emek, who is the living proof that talent and kind personality can really go well together.

PS. Thank you all for the wonderful birthday wishes! You’ve made me the happiest girl in the world and I loooove you!

amazing pictures, you look stunning!

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant. Top, culottes and bag Valentino Pre-Fall 14/Shoes Prada

And if we pretend to have wings on our backs, we begin to actually feel that we are flying.

The week kicks-off with an incurable reminiscing mood of the Parisian Fashion Week times, when I was wearing my blouse backwards(no drinking involved) and everything was fine. Yes you heard that right! That Valentino glorious insect was originally meant to rest on my chest. But then I’ve thought who in the world does rest during Fashion Weeks and turned things upside down. Gave my back some pretty wings to flyyyyy! Do try this at home but be careful because not all blouses have Valentino’s tailoring to permit such actions. You don’t want to end up looking like the Exorcist, get it? Head turn guys, you haven’t ever watched the horror?

The Valentino A/W 14-15 show itself  was impeccable, a sartorial delirium, an endless wish list! It’s not easy(at all) to overcome yourself and each time Maria Grazia Chiuri & Pierpaolo Piccioli they do, evolving their artistry to the very Haute Couture limits. Seems that ready-to-wear has turned a point. All I can say is that If there’s it’s a sin in the fashion world to characterize a House as your favorite one then I will be a sinner. Yes Valentino is MY LOVE!

Ph: Sara for Département Féminin 

My favorite Toulousians are back, in another French city, the mother of the cities, à Paris. This time, we’ve joined forces with my Parisian lover Charlotte to celebrate the fashion week with a photo shoot for Département Féminin at Place Vendôm, one of the most beautiful squares dans la magnifique ville, you see my Frenchies are back and strong!


On another (unfortunate) note, yesterday I’ve had an accident with my car’s door, that sadly required 8 stitches between my brow and my eye. An embroidered eye practically means vision sans fun, yet the my owe-ed x-rays will be back…soon…and I will find you…I promise you. 


Au revoir…

Get well soon! You look amazing here thought 🙂 <3

Get well soon. You look amazing!

I love your lip colour, who is it by??

Hey Nalini,
it’s from ByTerry and rightnow it’s my favorite brand for lipstics and blushes. xoxoxo

Great photos, great you, as always!

Ph Jordan Makarof

Here I am, like another royal blooded in secret, gracefully getting down my castle’s stairs, to finally declare my unconditional love for….. those boots! The thigh-high(est). Majest-est! By the way I’ve just remembered someone, under a street style feature on Harpers Bazaar with my other Parisian snake-skin Stella McCartney dress, mentioning that their bohemian nature didn’t flatter my dress. Well I guess that Margiela would not be very thankful that he is expanding in another, until now unknown to him, market, the hippie-chic may I say?! Beware Isabel Marant..

Will you still love me when I’m no longer beautiful….taste a little Gatsby just because….of THOSE stairs.

 

You look great with anything you put on!
By the way,I am in doubt for quite some time know,whether or not to invest in a Celine Box Bag,or not?As I see a bag as an investment:-))I would like your expert opinion to help me decide,what small bag should I go for,like a cool alternativ for my 2.55?I am in to fashion,but you know better the next big think:-)Much better.What would you by,cool and classic?Thank you!

Awww thank you Dana.
I would go gor the Chanel for an investment. Maybe a boybag?!

I was hopeing you would say that!

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

you are gorgeous!

I saw your street style photos with Nicole Warne!  Fashion is such a tiring business! 😉

Where have you seen them Serena? xoxoxo

I saw them on a few street style photogs’ site via links from WhoWhatWear.  At least 2 or 3 sites I can’t remember (they weren’t my daiy visit and not being bookmarked).  All on the day you and Nicole having the “animal” moment in Paris.  🙂  It must be weird facing so many camera lenses outside of shows because you would not know who’d post on what sites.  I bet they don’t always ask you for a card and/or give you a business card.

Amazing blazer!!

Love your outfit. The blazer is the perfect way add a bit of shine to an all-black ensemble a friend of mine bought the same at Parlour X. They have such a great selection of Saint Laurent.

Such an amazing post for your big welcome back! I really like the outfit. I’m madly in love with wearing blazers. Anywhere, anytime. So the golden one is just my cup of tea and looks amazing to this whole black outfit. xx

Ph Jordan Makarof

When on a recent interview I’ve been asked who’s my style icon, it took me awhile to answer. People change, styles change, times change, we change. Nothing stays the same and inevitably it’s difficult to have a reference point in my sartorial behavior. However there’s just one thing that never changes. Memories. That exact day, I’ve got the depicted dream-made Bottega jumpsuit. It’s awesome, no? Anyway, that’s not the point but when  I’ve looked myself in the mirror all the memories came rushing back. There was no doubt of who should I blame for my insatiable appetite for all-in-ones,  tailored blazers and leather jackets. My mother guys. All my love for the simplest silhouettes and the androgynous dressing is due to her strongest genes and her never ending tutorials. I remember in the very distant past she was wearing a winter white jumpsuit when others thought that it was some alien invasion’s forgotten leftovers. She really had the finger on the pulse of the fashion scene folks. Still no one but my mom can pull off so good a coat with a color combo that resembles prison stripes. No one. And I say still because she’s been through a lot, she’s a cancer survivor and her body(and way of thinking) has drastically changed yet she never gave up her love for fashion. She remains one of the chicest women I know and the fashion icon in my book.

 

Such a very cool look!!!

This jumpsuit is so beautiful. I could never pull it off but you look amazing in it. Love the boots pairing.

I love the look and the story even more – how wonderful – you mother sounds incredible

Thankfifi

Meawwwww…Isn’t what the sassy kittens do? Looking through their lashes, trying inwardly to be a full-time heart-melter?! You see I seriously want to get in DAT role!

-What role? Girl you’re getting weirder and weirder….

-Weirder the better!

To pull off that micro mini thing! That’s the role. And I’m telling you, It’s a protagonistic one.

So that’s honestly the shortest you can ever get from me. Not that I can’t be more revealing, I can’t, but there isn’t any more Lilliputian than that. We have reached the limits. Red alert.

Yes Mr Rousteing, you are such a firemaker!

ph Jordan Makarof

Happy Monday and February (of course) fellas. They say that it’s gonna be the month of the not so dynamic power reorganization, since that damn Mercury turns retrograde again but prepare to shine bright at the end it.

– Are you ready for a career change?

No, don’t get me wrong, I don’t see any potential in Astrology for me (yet) but I still find extremely helpful the existence of a planetary manuscript with dos and don’ts, a guide for all our unfocused minds. At the bottom line an excuse from above is always needed when shit happens, no?

So are you feeling passioned today? What, always? Then let’s play. Let’s do a quiz. Note the joyful Altuzarra depicted embroidery. We like it yes but I have a question: Where is it inspired from? I’ll start first and I say the Greek heritage …You?

 

 

This is a model inspired from the Romanian blouses of the 70s. The Romanian blouse has a collective author. It is not a fashion, it is a very meaningful tradition passed by generations of women who lived on the Romanian territory, part of Old Europe – 7000 years ago. The Greek culture has its roots in the Old Europe culture, so your remark is very interesting. 🙂
They used embroidery to communicate specific messages to the seen and unseen world.

Thank you Diana! It’s very interesting to learn how culture affects fashion.

In love with this outfit!

Ph Carin Olsson

Stella McCartney dress/Vintage Prada jacket/Tom Wood ring.
This is my second time attending the Haute Couture fashion week in Paris and honestly well worth my weirdest still-existing jet lag. Auto-recharge is always available as soon as my rubber soles touch down the facred* Paris-land. To begin, Haute Couture is not only a treat for the eyes. It’s a treat for the senses. A couple of months ago, when in Dior’s atelier I’ve had the chance to switch my usual black leather attire for a green sapphire gown. It was a  heavy-silk strapless dress. NO sparkles, no bids, no embroidery not any other impressive vision attractor. Just a simple floor-sweeping gown. However as soon as I secured the final hook of it’s geniously hidden internal corset I’ve realized that Raf Simons is definitely one of the greatest Couturiers alive. His magic stick, or his exquisite tailoring  if you’d like, had turned a structured silhouette to an extension of me. The very best of me. That dress was like flowing from my soul and If there was one moment in my life that I’ve felt like a Queen, well that was that. We all need an extraterrestrial experience once in a life time, no? Anyway what I’m trying to say in not-so simple words is that Haute Couture yes comes to impress but above all is a testament to the artful skills of a brilliant maker.

Now, the Spring 14 Dior show was a geometric/organic(if you think the extensive use of flowers) wonder. When I first approached the entrance at the Rodin Museum I was completely stunned. The building was covered by huge mirrored panels which were reflecting the great architectural heritage of the aforementioned museum. A blending of old and new, fanciful and realistic. Once inside it was pretty obvious. Simons and his audience, us, were going to time-travel. Two massive white, coming-from-our-very-distant-future-extra-stylish-mothership, corridors were ready to welcome their heroines. The collection itself was a vast collection of achievements. Artistry and craftmanship. But this time folks, the picture can partially speak because let’s face it, this is Haute Couture…a garden of senses….

 

 

*Hybrid: fashion-sacred

Stunning pictures! A very interesting collection of geometric forms, cutouts and transparent materials.
In particular I love your outfit you wore at the show! This dress is amazing!

stunning!
bravo to the photographer…and the photographed!  i think it’s a symbiotic relationship–no doubt you have a talented photographer on your hands but with a material such as yourself to work with…i’ll bet you make his job easy!

will you be gracing the snow-covered streets of NYC during fashion week?!

Thank you ❤️❤️
not this time… it’s damn too cold!

Great photos! In love with your jacket!

ph Jordan Makarof

After triplette I and it’s sequel triplette II, a new chromatic orgy repeatedly hits my sartorial appetite. It’s no secret that lately all my body cells are seriously attracted to this pretty diversified trio. Ok black is black, you know me I’m a crow and white always plays the significant role of the peace maker during the darkest days but camel?

Let’s get personal, Alex, my husband, is the easiest person in the world towards my dressing. He  never complains and I never explain. BUT from the beginning of our relantionship there were two things banned: Lace and camel. Especially for the first one before we got married he had a very strange demand for my wedding dress:

-Wear whatever you want but please NOT a damn lace. I hate it!

Honestly I still cannot find the origins of that hatred. However for the second one he was totally revealing: During his school years a stinky camel had spat in his face. That was it! After that anything reminds the poor animals causes Armageddon.

-Honey, camels do spit(wikipedia-checked), please don’t take it personal.  She probably doesn’t even remember you by now. And mine….well she’ll certainly behave. Isn’t she a beauty?


 

Love this long jacket reminds me of a pendleton coat I just bought. Great for winter layering.

Tired as you might be from the frequent glorifications of your penultimate editorial existence, I’m here to celebrate the photographic grandeur of this post and your “femasculine” silhouette as one of pure awesomeness. Kudos Evangelie, you supreme being!

Love the coat!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I’m a huge comment sucker. And I read every single of them. And I mean it. But how about to take this platonic relationship a step further? Are you ready?

-Hmmm…now you’re creeping us out!

Well I certainly don’t mean to sail from kinda-dating to married-with -kids. No that can’t happen. I’m already married. You? That’s exactly the point: To know more things about you. What’s your stories or at worst..what’s upppp? What did you eat last night, do you have a boyfriend, how’s your grandma doing…I can take anything… In our relationship please don’t let me be  the only great talker.

I hope you won’t jump the ship now….

Hey dear, are your IM pumps comfortable? 🙂 Still cant decide should I order them or wait and try! They are gorgeous! 

p.s. I recommended you as an great inspiration couple months ago! 🙂

I think you’re actually the only blogger who sticks with her own style.
I find your outfits so chique and Parisian!

marlsz.blogspot.com

Yesterday I saw you and Charlotte at Paris Fashion Week and I was flabbergasted. I didn’t know your blog before, so it tooks hours to find you! So glad and happy. You are perfect.

http://www.fashion-hooked.blogspot.com

Hi Mariska!
You should have talked to us…next time 😉
Thank you!

Your pictures are so goood!

Wow, your invisible readers surfaced in drove!  It’s so wonderful to read about them and about you.  🙂  You had your own business for years, no wonder there’s something very disciplined and solid about you (hard to hide essence in front of a camera lens).

Great to know that you are married.  It’s comforting to have someone close at home, in real life.  Sincerely wishing you and your beloved a team thru thick and thin supporting one another.

Well, me; almost 50, single (not dating either), no child, one cat, an office drone and a future pensioner (public sector, the only employer that provides retirees a pension now a day), living in an ultra hip area of LA, Chinese (from Taiwan), been living in USA 35+ years.

And you; perfect balance between photos and text, neither is too much or too long, a perfect escape into the land of couture fashion and witty writing.  There’s always something to learn from your styles, not just eye candy.

You’ve got a distinct style and voice, not interchangeable with other fashion bloggers (there are too many look-alike bloggers out there).  If I was a gambler, my money is on you to go far and grand.

33xoxo

PS.  I’ve never seen ripped jeans so artful and memorable.

PPS. Jordan is very good for you.  He’s helping you to develop your “voice”.

Yes isn’t it? Honestly I think it was the best idea I ever had during my cyberyears. It’s somekind of bonding to me.
Thank you for letting me know a bit better. I was very interested about you 🙂
So you are a cat person..I had a cat in the past…but she liked to continiously escape so once I lost her. I wish I knew you last year I was in LA. We could definitely have a live chat. Do you visit often Taiwan? Would you suggest it for me to go there for vacations?
Thank you for your feedback all this time, i really love your comments.
xoxoxo

A brilliant idea indeed!  Thank you for taking the time to reply to all who shared.  It really goes both ways.  🙂

I wish I’d visit taiwan more often (last time was 2010, after 20 years of no visit).  I am planning another 2-week trip this November to see my 85-year-old auntie again.  

Regardless if you’ve visited China or not before, I’d recommend Taiwan.  It’s small but not small.  It’s a blend of old and new.  Food is amazing with better quality (less fake ingredients compare to China) and better price (compare to Japan and Korea).  It’s cleaner than Thailand but not sterile like Singarpore, and MUCH SAFER than india.  People are well mannered and friendly towards travelers.  

If you visit both Taiwan and China, you will notice the difference between the two.  The same chinese people and culture but China is neauvo riche.  Too much money too fast and Cultural Revolution in the 70’s rub off a lot of class and heritage.  Let me recommend a travel writer’s web site.  He wrote about his experience visiting Taiwan in many of his blog entries.  http://landlopers.com/?s=Taiwan

Do check out the rest of his blog, too.  I love his travel writing and photos.

The curtains have officially rung down on the OMG factor of fashion, the Haute (of Hautest) Couture week and I’m back from Pariland with a surprisingly not-so-exhausted mood to tell about the revamped fairytale that can never go bad. Haute Couture week is a perfectly organized celebration of the wonders. The wonders of fashion, the masterpieces of art. Not-so-much to my own surprise (it’s the second time that I’m attending the HC week) at this point of time Paris is the capital of peace and totally enjoyable. Not any chaos outside of the shows or any unreasonable hysteria, no human-lines in front of the boutiques, not a week booking in advance for your favorite restaurant at the very least. Pareeee was a pure seduction. The snugggled-in-my-shearling depicted me was shot by the brilliant Carin Olsson who I met again, last time was during the (literally)steamy NYFW) at the seats of the Dior Enterprise or the futuristic corridors of a super stylish future.  More on that will follow shortly but first I have to answer to all of you who I briefly encountered on my previous post. I’m back people!

I love your shearling jacket. It’s difficult to find a statement coat that’s warm. Isn’t Carin fabulous? She takes the most beautiful photos.

I am head over heels for that jacket.

this jacket, if you did not say vintage, I’d have never guessed!  Great design is long lasting.  🙂

Love what you said about PFW and the city in late January.  Imagine how many people worked their bxtt off to produce and present the shows!  Attendees are the luckiest people, pure fantasy and enjoyment.

The dress is to die for!

FAB!

Oh those boots… I’ve been dreaming about them almost 2 years now… This is the only mid-height boot I have found (remember me telling you how difficult it is to find one???) but unfortunately it is “a bit” over my budget… dammit %^%@#^&&^%&…
The print of the dress is also something new to dream about…

The details of that bag are absolutely stunning!

The bag is just insanly beautiful. Love the look as always 🙂

This bag is phenomenal!

Nice twist on high “low” mix.  😉  Bag is def. high end.  Jumper, long shorts, and trainers to the untrained eyes may look high street but are in fact high end (maybe not uniqlo but still….).  Well done!  🙂

How contemporary!!!!! Not just fashionable.
Excellent!!!

It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

In repeat.

When I fall in love with a song why do I play it to death until I hate it? The same mysteriously happen with my bags, my shoes(in response to all these complains about my Demeulemeester boots) even my bras! Now you know the truth. I simply can’t help it. If more like me, do exist out there, please give a shout. I don’t really like to be alone. If not, well then a professional needed to efficiently handle my case.

Back to our friend from the past, the almighty Marant, her latest resort collection is certainly not any fresh start but definitely a good turn to some kind of evolution, don’t you think? RE-FRIEND!

 

 

stunning!

I do hear a song on repeat when I like it!same goes with bags and shoes…but I do like to rotate my clothes a lot!

Love the shoes!

All outfits from SohoSoho. The sunglasses are of course Linda Farrow.
The New Year’s Eve bash might belong to the past for planet earth but on Style Heroine the festivities never end. After a long, long break, I’ve finally returned to my space station, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the most exclusive eyewear in the world. Linda Farrow. No introduction needed I guess, for the brand that has collaborated with great designers such as Alexander Wang, Dries Van Noten, The Row etc. Yeap, these dudes  have seriously and continuously haunted all of my wish lists. So Linda Farrow to beat the drum of her 10-year success , visited some of the major cities in the world to select for each one her muse. Among them Natalie Jools for NY, Tina Leung for Hong Kong and the depicted cat-eyed lady, me, for Athens. Our photo shoot took place at the historic city center and outside of Linda Farrow‘s pop up store at the SohoSoho. Enjoy!

I adore her!

Love this and the “not what you think” post.  You are a tease!

WhoWhatWear chose you to be the best in couture style of its 2013 bests.  I think the editorial staff made the right choice.  You are, hands down, the best in showcasing couture.  Models are fine but they are not the norm.  You make couture pieces seem attainable (wearable for the mortals) yet still artful.

Can’t wait to see what you will achieve in 2014, be it styling, editorial, or brand collab.

Happy New Year!

Isn’t it the most outrageous quote on planet earth(look at the tittle)? But you have to admit it guys, we all just love saying that.

So my little Drama Queens, to your own surprise, this time indeed it’s not what it looks like. In the background are not the frozen peaks of the Swiss Alps.


-Okay, you are Greek no? You must be at…Arahova?!

It’s NOT snow! Avalanche risk level is below zero!

-Not ? And what on earth is that not-snow-white thing on your back?

Hmmmm…can’t tell… Jordan will kill me if I do reveal his secret locations and I haven’t left a legacy yet. 🙂

Anyway..I don’t know if  you have really noticed  but from now and on there will be some additional information associated with my ensembles. Sizing that is.  I find it amazingly helpful to know the depicted outfit’s size when shopping online and I’ve been thinking(loudly):  if this is the way that I, a caring individual, could contribute to humanity, so be it!

Are you lost in translation*?

-Kind off..But Isn’t our relationship always like that? Somehow complicated?

Well, then let me clear that up for you. “Arni” is a Greek word and means sheep. So I’ve though that since I am resembling with the aforementioned species, it could be really useful to multilingually mention it. Yes I know it’s very risky but please don’t start a fur debate again. Afterall I am not a vegetarian, wouldn’t it be very hypocritical If I was a sworn enemy of shearling?

Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

-Arghhhhh..hmmmmm…we cannot see any difference..Are we blinded?

-Only temporarely… no worries.

So let me be the naughty one who’s gonna spill the beans: It’s the hair guys. These pics were taken approximately a month ago when my precious brain neighbored then with my lighter locks. Now I mention that, you’ve never commented on my recenly “darker” look. Actually I don’t know If I have ever told you but the very dark brown, or else the almost black , is my natural hair color. All the others were just fast trips to the blonde, happy planet.

Getting another return ticket, this time back to the seriousness of describing an ensemble, let’s talk about slits and the world of the peekaboo skirts. The depicted one was bought from my recent trip to Stockholm. I usually travel with a lighter suitcase because I really love to buy useful souvenirs and what’s more “useful” to me than my own clothes? Naaaaa, nothin else, I am a humble blogger you know…So when in the Swedish capital, the original plan was to visit as many Acne stores and pack as much as I could. The plan could have more success if the aforementioned brand didn’t have out of stock my size in most of their goodies.

-Please Acne mega mind if you can hear me right now, please restock. You see there are more of us and we are demanding.

Anyway, with slits I am kinda of strict. Either it goes all way up or it goes home. As a matter of fact, I think that the small ones are totally unflattering. But if it is still a shock for your previously conservative status to be( half) publicly exposed, you can just add the most asexual parts of your wardrobe and….tadaaa….the harmony is back as it supposed to be. You create the harmony.

Let’s begin with something very irrelevant! Did you see Homeland’s season finale? Gosh! What was that? No, please don’t worry, there won’t follow a spoiler so you can freely open your eyes and listen to my mini yet loud demonstration: That end completely sucked. It was an epic failure. Yes you know who you are… Yes I’m pointing my finger at you, you…terrible producers. You suck!

There it is, I’ve said it!

Abundant sunshine will continue for the rest of the day as we will march on the familiar fashion road. So you have the leather pants. the black knit, even the thigh high boots for your winter essentials. But what’s the most basic of all that if you haven’t yet possessed you probably face a never-ending wardrobe malfunction? By the latest I certainly do not imply, exposing publicly your nipples. It’s just that without a grey coat, yes that’s the answer, you simply make your life difficult. It’s the most basic item of all, matching practically with your whole closet saving you from the painful clothing-puzzles. You see, I love being a problem solver but out of my closet.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?

-Ohhhhh my little onion….
I don’t even know if that term really exists in the universal vocabulary or it was just my mother’s very creative imagination that described my super stuffed looks before sending me to the chilly classrooms. However, what Freud would most certainly say…:

– That all explains your all layer-resistant outfits girl. Childhood trauma alert!

Anyways…I do, try to keep it minimal by any means but when the great cold hits the door, I try to be…how can I say…inventive?! Just to preserve my ability to move you know. For example the depicted wool cape. Warm when it hugs your body, flexible enough to give the much-needed freedom to your hands. You see now? I can move! Even  at zero degrees….

Battling my Monday-blues by showcasing  my most recent(and proven difficult) find in the world’s most extensive research ever!

– Well….you mean after Titanic…

You know I hadn’t realized how impossible it was to find a real pair of flat leather(not suede)thigh high boots in the market. A market by the way, in which apparently the word “just” is missing out of the category “over the knee”.  And one day, precisely about a week ago, when I really thought that I had seen everything, the God of the search engines did mercy me and thunderbolt(ed) these beauties on my non-Mac screen. Eurika! All I ever wanted in a price that doesn’t guarantee the bottom bed in a prison cell….

Hi Evangelie,

Your site is beautiful! Love your fashion style 🙂 

I came across an identical pair of thigh high boots and had a few questions. Sorry, I know this is one of your older posts and you may not have this information.

Is the material stretchy? I am about 175 cm~ with slightly athletic calves. How high does the boot go above the knee for you?

Thank you! 🙂

Hi Alice,
they are not very stretchy and the go very high but they tend to fall…..
I don’t know if I’ve helped much but I’m here to answer if you have more questions:)
xx

hi,
the boots are amazing and so is your style.
I am just wondering if they fall down a lot when you are walking?
all my over knee boots become not so over knee after all.
thanks

Hi Wendy,
they are very high on thighs so even when they fall a bit during walking they are still up.

Great boots. How do they run? True to size, small to size or large to size?

Thanks in advance

They are true to size Andy. xo

I love your boots… amazing

Most of you may have noticed my not-so-recent gravitation towards to the completely heelless situations. No nowadays miracles do not really happen and people unfortunately you don’t get taller after the tender age of 17 I guess..That’s not the reason. It’s just this crazy idea stuck in my head, currently unwilling to emigrate to another planet. Outfits do look better with flats! How on earth did it come to this?
-Hey maybe you’re slightly cuckoo….
Well perhaps it’s the spotlessness, the I-can-kick-your-ass easily factor, when a humble flat adds to the whole that I really like. Yeah, I can kick your ass and then run…
-Catch me if you can

Love it!

So here I am, dressed as a serious danger, to answer the greatest question of all time: Am I a bag or a shoe girl? Whoever guesses correctly will win two tickets to the Yeezus concert. Joking but Isn’t it the thing of the moment? However to put things straight, it turns out that Kanye’s Holy, I’m-a-kinda-new-age-Moses,  Mountain themed concert is(even if you’re not big fun of his music) not boring a pleasure for your eyes.

-You’re off the topic girl….We’ll give you an F.

Anyway If you were better than me in astrophysics, I doubt it though :), you’ll have already guessed the answer…I’m an unconditional shoe girl. I always knew it but after Paris I am also sure about it. Yes my darlings, I can even survive a whole fashion week without a bag!

-How come?

Well I’ve bought a Smythson card holder. That simple. So If you have your money, your hotel’s card key and your shoes on what else would you need?

– Some makeup maybe?

I always use minimum make up but if there’s something missing out in this bag-absence equation, that might be an iPhone charger. Is it just mine or all those damn mobiles’ batteries don’t last longer than Downton Abbey’s Christmas episode?

Then again, most of the restaurants outhere, they do have a spare one to save the day. So…..tell me now…Who needs da bag?

Absolutely love this.

My rain dance has worked at last! The god of rain has just visited Athens with his massive thunderbolt in hand and I have finally stopped been grumpy for no reason the prolonged summer heat wave. Trust me, It was getting really weird. More specifically aliens-invaded-earth-heated-up-the-core-and-suddenly-all-humans-melted-from-microwaves weird. Anyway… In this wholly wetphoria* situation,  I….. feel drowsy. Honestly guys if you want to make me sleep in no-time, let me listen the rain sound(even audio) or a hairdryer! Actually the second one is the shameful reason of my never-ending inappropriate like a horse sleep when in hair salons.

-Hmmm…..we always knew that you’re kind of problematic!

Well, I think it’s a (not-so) sweet residual from childhood, when my mom has been giving me a bath every single night, just before bedtime. And boy how much I hated that bathtime. It was a nightmare!  No, no don’t worry. I’m not still an adamant water hater. Some things have drastically changed. You can certainly approach me.

Yeap from multicultural to multilingual! What more does a blog can offer folks? Common! Do tell!
-Multidimensional maybe?
-Yeap…in another universe! For now I’m live blogging from Stockholm, actually from my softest bed zone, after a fruitful/awesome day in the Swedish Capital. It is my first visit to this amazingly beautiful city and its only for work. No vacay. A new day has home for this blog, aawaaaa (Celine-Dion-stolen), but per usual I can’t say much. Actually this time my tongue is also tied by a confidentiality agreement so…nobody wants to put Ev on jail….don’t you?. Patience my favorite human beings…after all isn’t that the greatest ability?(after simplicity of course). I know this blog is getting no sense…

Jo No Fui dress/Avant Toi beanie/Celine shoes(similar here)/Saint Laurent bag(black, red, silver, croc)

ph Jordan Makarof

“When you apologize for doing something wrong, that’s an act of atonement.”

And who does really set the rules? I mean when wrong is universally bad, like killing, stealing, decrying, then it’s wrong and atonement is basically the catalyst for your salvation. To make YOU feel better. Because “wrong” is already done and you just can’t step back in time. Not until the time-machine is finally found at least.

 

-Why so serious?

Well you are definitely aware of the meaning of  “chain reaction”. It all started with that dress. The ethereal Jo No Fui dress. It kinda reminds me of my all time favorite piece, the “Atonement” gown. It’s Keira Knightley’s mind blowing green dress. Do you remember it now? Of course you do. Anyway with that vivid memory brought to mind, I realized that as a Greek native, I had never, ever searched for the actual meaning of the aforementioned movie’s title. So I did and that’s the least complicated that I’ve found, not involving God or religions. And then a whole day passed thinking of my lifetime story. The need to explain and apologize, as the only way of not feeling better but actually to bring out of people a better self. If there was. That changed. Completely.  Suddenly my life turned a corner and I’ve realised that you really don’t have to explain yourself. Misinterpretations do not exist. People will like you or dislike you, agree or disagree, perceive your behavior as good or bad,  for their own reasons,  whatever you do. You can’t change that. You have already a small spot in their life’s big plan and you don’t even know it. On the other hand think about your mother’s love. Do you always have to explain yourself or being apologetic for the misunderstandings? There’s not such thing. There are no misunderstandings. Because when true love exists respect and understanding take place of the pretty much useless words.  For all the rest you just shouldn’t care. Be good with yourself, cherish your soul with love and kindness and stay true to you beliefs. Then leave the universe to think what it want to think. That’s the way life goes.

Tonight like another memory refresher, we’re going to celebrate this blog’s moto: “simplicity is the greatest ability” that is. You do remember it, no? And there is no better time than the present to write about how they all started…Well I was a little girl when…No, no, no, I’m joking. Let’s go again, It all began with my unconditional love for the simplest things. Here it is. That goose bump factor coming from the beauty of the complete effortless dressing. I just wanted the world to know that yes, the aforementioned X can exist even if it’s not surrounded by blingful sequins.

-Hmmmm, we thought that it was all an ode to black.

You know, you are a very, very devilish audience…:)

Such a beautiful and classic outfit. Really love that close up shot of your bag – gorgeous! xx

 


I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

The last ensemble of my collaboration with Département Féminin was honestly my favorite one. That favorite that it seriously had to be mine. And well… It did. You know me I don’t really get along well with my obsessions. So the “good” preppy dress with the most fragile bow on its neck line, did marry the baddest, sickest biker jacket in the style history and all together, the three of us, did join the Elie Saab ss14 runaway show during Paris Fashion Week. Sometimes it’s good to be bad….no?

Just wow! my words for now!

lovely!

Jumpsuit Alexander Wang/Coat Halston Heritage/boots Ann Demeulemeester
Ph Jordan Makarof
There was a time, specifically in 2007(when you weren’t even born), that I was clinically obsessed with jumpsuits. And if you think the use of the word “clinically” is an exaggeration for the sake of the blog, boy this time you are…wrong! I can guess your usual practical minds are the great barriers between you and mine, then, totally homogeneous uniformic wardrobe. As far as I can remember, you know my golden-fish-memory issues, that longest list included among others, a black wool one from Zadig & Voltaire, three same but different Marants, a frivolous McCartney and the whole all-in-one collection from ASOS. So, clinically proven, after that period I obviously needed a break. A long, I-only-wear-separates, break.

However when I firstly saw that slickest white Alexander Wang jumpsuit in FW catwalk,the wedding bells have tolled! Bam! Big loves are never forgotten people and here I am tripping back into the old days. I’m all over obsessed!

-Oh….you are weak girl.

-Oh shut up…nobody can resist that….

AMAZING!!

http://www.daintyclub.etsy.com

The perfect jumpsuit, the perfect coat pluuus the perfect boots… ok, it totally blows my mind! That’s exactly what I love about your style – minimalism, simplicity, perfect combo of feminine and masculine. Besides, you make me want to do the bangs 😀

I love love love the jumpsuit. It’s so clean, structured, and other words that I cannot even begin to express!

The photo shoot took place in the Island Private House.

-Does Bambi have antlers?

-Well, I’m the adult version….I guess I’ve grown up.

-Any other questions?

-Me, me! How many spots does Bambi have?

-Shit…wrong questions lead to even wronger…questions.

So today, in this cure-to-printophobia outfit, I’m stepping out of the bushes in the crowd with the universal reassurance that “if I can do it then everybody can”. If you only think that in my not-so-long-ago past, the cutest spots of a fawn would bias been traced on the half part of an ala Givenchy sweatshirt, then a wholly animal print look is a great, great improvement surprise….

 

I love the last photo! The bambi color and print looks stunning with your tanned skin. Yeah, pretty damn great look.

I think we can all agree that the above black stealthy limb-clothes win the “illusionist of the year” title. Yes, yes. Double score! Look closely at their leather panels. And now let’s hear loudly your thoughs”

-Are they trousers?

-Are they thigh high boots?

-I think I saw them flying!

Exactly. They are superpants! And I love them.

 

the boots…!!!!! :-O

I love your pants, looking gorgeous!

They’re pants?  I’m not sure if that is better than thigh-high boots, which is awful.  Not a fan.

Love the hat!

Let me reassure you that all this sudden color explosion lately, is definitely not due to a crazy hormonal outburst. Not that I don’t have these kind of Super Novas from time to time, God help whoever stands by me, hubby that is. It’s just when perfection in the form of a tuxedo, knocks your door, the depicted muted green is the best black you’ve ever had. On a short (honest) notice…this is a tailored awesomeness!! Woot, woot!

How can you celebrate fall in this part of the world when you are still packed like sardines on the mediterranean shores just to preserve your already degrading tan?

-Poor you. Life was never meant to be a struggle!

-Of course irony was a border we  hadn’t crossed…until NOW!

Anyway…last week I got to do the honors at the celebratorial-fall ribbon-cutting ceremony with an exclusive photo shoot for MyTheresa  and my favorite seasonal pics from it’s never-ending  fashion amazingness . My choises were as simple as my style moto yet so hard to live without…at least for this fall!

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

Literally….because on the other side of the pond even the construction sites are photo shoot worthy….

Remember when in NY I went to Intermix-Meatpacking District to style and shoot their current collections? Well just before your eyebrows are floating, in my very minimal space layout, which btw I need urgently to change, the last of the images of our collaboration. Looking thoroughly at the pics though I really wonder how in the world did I stand on my own feet following a long, exhausting overseas flight and a douse with a bucket of cold water when my suitcase hadn’t ever arrived. Well Intermix must have some magical effect on me.

Nice shots. Cool outfits!

Fall is literally on our the way, just a step ahead, ok maybe it’s an Olympic long jump for this part of earth since it’s still 35 degrees outside, yet we never stop lusting for the amazing, already in stores, Fall collections. Harpers Bazaar US has asked me, alongside with some of my style heroines, to choose my favorite pieces from this season. One thing to be said: I’ve just stopped struggling with myself and one of them is already resting on my couch….Ouch!
You can see the feature here.
Thank you Harpers Bazaar US for the great honor and especially Kerry Pieri.

Congrats!
Love your style – great Blog!!

Number two and three are such good picks! The Stella coat is perfection, but way above my budget, so the Mango look-a-like will have to do.

Totally love seeing you among the fashion heavy weights!  You belong there, in the upper echelon of trend setters.  Vogue, W, and such should follow Bazaard’s lead in featuring you.  You have the eye and flair for couture fashion that totally sets you apart from the sea of fashion bloggers.  You go girl!  Can’t wait to see you getting recognized for your taste and talent.

When packing for trip, I really hate to instagram it. Yes I admit it, I continue to be terribly superstitious but this time I can reasonably justify it.

Listen to me carefully… the evil eye lurks above my insta-account. It’s true…and shit happens. My suitcase was lost! Gone! Puff! I arrived in NY bagless, shoeless, dressless and eventually headless… Thank god the sweetest folks from Intermix , provided me with all the needed awesomeness to survive the first two days of the fashion week.

The above images are the first ones of a series of my collaboration with Intermix and Netrobe for NYFW. Enjoy.

PS: My suitcase eventually was found and sent to my hotel after just two days. You know(evil eye)…don’t mess with me…I’m Greek and Greeks know good spells..:)

Awesome Outfit!You are such a beauty…

Great Style! Especially I love the J-Brand leather leggings.

Omg I can’t believe your suitcase was lost! Thankfully Intermix had your back and eventually your suitcase made it to you.

that was SCARY!  I hope you don’t have anything valuable in your suitcase (like a Chanel bag or something) for the sticky fingers to steal.

no thank god they returned it two days after 

First photo is fun! 😉

love the jacket!

In a total reincarnation of blogging’s Speedy Gonzales, my fingers are on fire people, I’ll be so quick that you’ll probably hate me. Yet with a good reason. I’m in NY!!!!!!!! I’m here with Netrobe  to attend the fashion week  and I just can’t stop gasping in awe of how beautiful the city looks at this time of the year. I shall mind the gaps though….:)

ps. The shoot happened a couple of days before I left, uploaded hastily on the blog, because as we Greeks say, eyes that don’t meet, they’re soon forgotten…:)

 

Love this!! So perfect. You kinda look like Victoria Beckham in these photos 🙂

my favourite Greek blogger!!! koukla!!! xxxx

Please don’t grimace on my blog’s unexpected flush.
-You? The sworn black tyrannosaur are wearing pink?
I agree but then, I redefined my parameters. There are pinks and pinks out there. The depicted one, the “killed pink” well…that color suits me! In a weird way. But that ironically “muted” hue of the most frivolous shade really suits me.
Right now all I can imagine is your sardonic smile and…

-Never say never.

Word!

Ps. Don’t forget to join Netrobe‘s most amazing contest! Yes big spender 1000$ from Intermix are waiting for you. Rush!

 

Ahhh! Such a beautiful colour and print

my first thought when i saw the title ‘surprise’ —  you’re pregnant!  ha!  glad you’ve joined team pink (even if it’s not because you’re expecting a baby girl!)–it works well on you (actually, ditto to the earlier poster–everything works well on you!)….so pretty as always!

great color!

Instagram is definitely taking the photo sharing to a whole new miraculous level.  You post something good, that simultaneously get’s caught by the usual eagle eyes and then, if you have already done the mistake and you haven’t hashtag it……you get bombed! Email bombed. My girls know what they want and they want it now!   So here It is ladies, the black McQ leather tight awesomeness, that everybody loved when worn back at Malene Birger’s SS14 show, in flesh and blood link. Now you can have it ;)…


It is incredible.x

Thankfifi

The skirt looks awesome on you.

You’re really amazing. You always have the key pieces of each collection. How do you do? ^^

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?


I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

-What’s the difference between all black(everything) and so black?
-A white shoe-tongue. Don’t you see? Do I have to explain everything in this cyber world?
-Are you getting your period or something?
-I need vacations…
-Weirdo….

You can never go wrong with black.

Let’s start with the following hypothesis: if  Phoebe’s mega-mind has already added fluffy furry creatures, the ultimate winterizer, to the summer’s most anticipated sandals, the, now infamous, Birkenstocks then why don’t we all wear leather in the heat?

– Because we’re all gonna faint from the fumes of our boiling parts. Are you nuts?

–  Whatever…Ignorance is the best revenge so…

If every hypothesis needs to get tested by an experiment well I’m the live one. Don’t you see? I’m still happily standing.

 

 

absolutely stunning!:-)

I could spend an entire day talking about that  green blast from the past and all the happy memories being carried over but I have to pack folks and you don’t want to me to walk naked through the streets of Copenhagen….. 🙂

 

Got a flashback from the past too 😉 Those Adidas were one of my first pair of sneakers (with yellow stripes). Love them! Think it’s time for a Adidas Superstar revival! flaircat.com

Reminds me of college days!

Between you and me, you knew that something was about to come…no? Could you imagine though,  that it would be the most amazingly exciting project ever? Yeap, life, even when Mercury is retrograde, is a beauty….

When  Harper’s Bazaar asked me to document my Paris Haute Couture looks for a super special diary, the answer was exactly the same as the one given to my marriage proposal: unconditional YES. I love  you but then…..who doesn’t?

Thus last week  Jordan, has travelled with me to the city of lights to capture my moments  just before the shows of the ever frantic PFW. Later Jordan had returned home with fever, I directly flew to the Canarys. I’m an extra tough cookie ;)….

The whole outfit diary is now live on Harper’s Bazaar.

 

Thank you Harpersbazaar.com. I’m super excited and beyond honored for our new collaboration.

And last but not least thank you Kerry Pieri. It’s been amazing working with you.

 

 

Incredible – congratulations!x

Thankfifi

The pictures AND outfits are stunning!

Love your dress
You look adorable

The concept of a traveling fashionista wasn’t very hard to see, the models had boarding tags in their hair and on their clothes. The hair and makeup did not go unnoticed, the amazing Eugene Souleiman and the legendary Pat McGrath stood behind the creative and fun looks.

Seeing sneakers at a couture show isn’t something you usually witness, but doing so was refreshing and if someone could pull it off, it would be the great John Galliano.

Beautiful pictures. It is nice to notice the idea behind these dresses; woman in a rush.
Thanks

I LOVE Maison Margiela, you’re so lucky that you’ve been there! Especially John Galliano is a pure genius and he was one of my most fav designers at House of Dior. The work he does for Margiela is amazing and I think they didn’t have a better designer because his creativity is endless.

ellecitychocolate.blogspot.cz

I can’t begin to try and understand or dissect the work of John Galliano. As a creative being I am in awe of the great work of John Galliano, I’m so glad he’s back !!

Acclaimed for his distinctly glamorous and seductive designs, Peter Dundas’ eponymous label is all about that and some more. His black S/S17 shimmering dress is my favorite piece from his debut collection, and it truly is the perfect LBD to channel you inner diva.

Dare to wear stockings that match your shoes! My monochrome look is complete with these gorgeous coco leather mules by The Row. You can try this look with any color of the rainbow though.

This gorgeous cozy red coat from Common Leisure is Christmas in a garment, so say goodbye to ugly Christmas sweaters and say hello to chic staple pieces that work for the holidays and any other day for that matter!

The deconstructed pieces oozed legacy however it all came together in a very Galliano way that left an aftertaste of glamour and excellence. I think it’s a easier to slip into banality and recycled ideas when the brand’s legacy is as strong as Maison Margiela’s, however thanks to Galliano’s endless and uncompromising creativity – nothing is ever banal about his shows. Instead of living in a legacy, Galliano is continuing it the only way he can, which is the greatest homage of them all.

With one of the hottest tickets in the world of fashion I have the honor to magically teleport you to Pierpaolo Piccoli's incredibly beautiful world, the world of Valentino. Maison Valentino's SS17 Haute Couture show was not just another Haute-Couture moment but a dream skillfully translated into reality. Actually, it is Pierpaolo's dream, the sole creative director of the house, who artfully orchestrated a very modern fairytale whose significance will be remembered for years. Not only because he feasted our senses with the goose bumping intensity of the exclusive musical score by the great Master Alexandre Desplat but also because he just gave to fashion the biggest lesson: That simplicity is the greatest ability. Graceful shapes and cuts, sculpted pleats, chiffon braids, delicate hand stitched frills, a marvel of minimalism, divine creatures floating like billowing clouds, opening a getaway to the sky. A triumph of craftsmanship. Brava Pierpaolo.

All the pictures are great and awesome. Loving the collection of dresses. Priceless!

Hope you’re going to some great shows at NYFW! Looking forward to more editorials

I loved this collection,  so  simple yet so chic!

Valentino Rockstud Spike bag| Valentino dress| Valentino tights| Valentino sandals

Photography Haris Farsarakis

It’s a new dawn / It’s a new day / It’s a new life…and we’re feeling good Mr Pierpaolo Piccioli!

Yes it’s a new era for my favorite House of magic Valentino under the creative direction of Pierpaolo Piccioli and the depicted Rockstud Spike bag, represents the first sign of the Historic House’s new path.

And If I can judge from these baby steps into this new world, It’s gonna be young, edgy, unconditional and uber cool.

For the Rockstud spike bag couture becomes trend thanks to an artisanal quilted technique a scene of studs enlightens its surface as if it being a punk dotting. My favorite piece of the bag tho is the handle as it’s super adjustable, a super fun accessory that can be adjusted to you mood and personality.

The future looks so bright at Maison Valentino.

 

Photos are amazing

Exclusively on styleheroine.com you can see so close Fendi’s  newest Fall-Winter collection that you can almost feel it.  So far my very favourite show from Milan’s fashion week, with powerful prints, artisanal excellence, futuristic shapes and the hottest reds ever. Enjoy!

 

 

 



The red boots are a dream. Just wonderful. Very beautiful FENDI photos. Thanks for that.

You can salute summer on various ways on the first day of September. Some will say goodbye by taking one last dip in the sea while others will try to forget the end of the season by eating a whole tube of ice cream. I, on the other hand, don’t want to forget, I want to remember, the good times and the better ones that are yet to come. Being optimistic much? One may ask what’s better than a breezy summer night? Anywhere that love can flourish I would say…Coming back from Maldives, a place that gives you the time to find yourself again, the one that you’ve had neglected by working so hard for the past year, makes you see things quite differently. What I mean about differently? Well It’s good, almost precious, to take a step back , don’t go with the flow and enjoy what you’ve accomplished so far. Trying for more might come to a dead-end and striving for excellence might be an utopia. All that matters is feelings and if these airy fringes brought you back for a second to an island’s distant shores, then on this space there will be always summer.

such  a cute dress!

The Chanel Fall 2017 couture show was a triumphant celebration of Coco Chanel and the city in which she lived; evident by a scale replica of the Eiffel Tower in the middle of Grand Palais. The set design may have filled Instagram feeds today, but it was the breath-taking collection that filled our hearts with admiration for the Parisian je-ne-sais-quoi and awe for the style that is characteristic of the undisputed fashion capital of the world.

Tweeds and leathers dominated the runway today, embellished with feathers and finished off with beautiful boater hats. The shoes were sublime too, all in patent leather in various lengths (I’m very, very tempted by the knee-high ones).

Karl Lagerfeld creates a unique world around each collection and within these worlds live the most exquisite Haute Couture pieces that I am so lucky to experience.

Thank you Chanel!


In love with the patent leather boots. Both over the knee and the mid high ones look so nice! 😍

Love the collection! And those leather boots!

Rockstud Untitled double-breasted Trench coat

  Rockstud Untitled Clutch

  Rockstud Untitled Sneaker 

Photography Haris Farsarakis

Creative direction & styling Evangelie Smyrniotaki

For boys and for girls, actually for everyone who appreciates the contemporary beauty, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli did it again (without oops) created the perfect, imperfection, the project name Untitled. Inspired by the Japanese technique of the kintsugi, that consists in repairing broken ceramic objects with gold powder Maria Grazia and Pierpaolo developed a capsule collection of twelve essentials of our wardrobe, from the beige trench to the jeans and the white sneakers only this time the binding component are the studs. Yes you’ve heard it well, instead of the familiar to all of us stitching, a part of each item has been detached and adjusted using golden studs.

When the time came to brainstorm about the concept of this editorial, I’ve been so moved by the deep meaning of this collection and I’ve been continuously keep telling to myself that I had to find an element that connects everything. My story with Rockstud Untitled’s story, a living thread…. Water. That was it. Yes water is inherently a substance that connects everything to everything else and it was just in front of my eyes when in Paris. The clumsy me during the last fashion week I almost drowned myself in this fountain after I stepped on my floor-length dress. Kidding-not, the danger belongs to the past, the future is bright and alongside with Valentino, even brighter.

Enjoy.

So cool!

Such a gorgeous coat!
Love,

My travelling patterns are much like an espresso, short and intense and with a lot of sugar thanks to the host with the most – Michael Kors! Last week I went to Shanghai for the first time ever, to celebrate the The Walk event.

When I arrived at the Waldorf Astoria, not only was I greeted by the most spectacular view of the skyline, the MK fam remembered my favourite flower and had beautiful white roses arranged by my bed and a gorgeous goodie bag of course.

Before the event, we went on an amazing tour of the city and stopped by the majestic Jing’an Temple. This is what I love about Shanghai, the old, traditional lives side by side in perfect harmony with the ultra modern. The city is dynamic and has something interesting for everyone, no matter what you’re into.

To the The Walk event I was channeling a bit of disco diva, and went for a dazzling metallic leopard dress. My favourite accessory however was, and still is of course, the Sofie smartwatch. I didn’t think I was going to be such a nerd about it but seriously, it is so handy and I use it all the time. It gives me everything from traffic notifications, to message alerts to, and most important, a great finish to any look. There’s no styling trick to it really, but if you want  to mix it up a bit, wear it over chunky sleeve to accentuate the watch even more!



Beautiful!

I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

“Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There’s nothing you can’t do
Now you’re in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York, New York, New York”

Good morning from the frozen yet glorious Big Apple for Pierpaolo Piccioli’s first Pre Fall collection for Valentino. It’s the first Pre Fall collection that it will also have a catwalk  show and no need to tell how excited I am to see what amazingness he holds for us.

Go PP, go Valentino.

Love this collection! Looking forward to the flower prints and embroidery/applique on the streets.
http://www.styleme.green

I also wrote an editorial on this, as well as one on their former creative director – Maria Grazia Chiuri – who is now at Dior. Both collections were fabulous

http://www.aryachic.com/christian-dior-pre-fall-2017-review

This collection is phenomenal, I see the consistent repetition of florals throughout the collection, can’t wait for florals to be a major trend in 2017. Love your blog heaps, I was wondering if maybe you could help me out and answer a few questions, related to fashion blogging?
Thank you,

OMG! so cool. I love everything Valentino!

I'm in love with the way that this adorable Louis Vuitton Perfume set looks and what's more perfect than a perfume for every mood? These little beauties range from light, floral scents to deeper smokier ones for colder times. This also happens to be the most perfect gift for the indecisive soul, am I right?

La creme main is my knight in shining armour during the cold winter times. Especially with its practical and cute packaging, you can moisturise everywhere and it fits in any bag. Having soft hands is key, and never to be neglected boys and girls!

For the summer I’m taking cue from Delpozo’s S/S18 show and I’m going for the rosy, natural make-up, slick hair and a big statement head piece in everybody’s favourite material - straw! Is it summer yet?

Leotard Valentino|
 Dress Valentino|
 Boots Valentino

Photography Haris Farsarakis

Winter warm up and a trend to watch. 2 in 1 for a Monday that I try to remember when was the last time that I wore real clothes. Yes I am still barefooted in Maldives, wearing nothing than my swimwear. We even go sans shoes to diner, a habit that I am afraid might cost me one week of my life, trying to figure out how I am gonna fit my toes into shoes. So this post is something like a missing note to the gloomy dressed-up Parisian days and the trends that are yet to come.

Nice looking outfit..

leotards are a girls best friend

Love this layered look and the contrast of the chunky boots.

That’s what I call Winterized Summer fashion! The pleated airy dress makes you look like a ethereal beauty, leotard underlines your ideal body and sweet shoulders… and boots are saying like: Hey, I am not that simple! 🙂 Love it!

This gorgeous red mini-skirt is perfect for your Christmas party or any other party where you're feeling extra. Alessandra has quickly become one of my go-to designers for flirty, feminine, chic.

The association between gowns and haute couture may still be strong but Valentino keeps blurring the line between evening and day wear, proving that that excellence and impeccable craftsmanship is present in whatever Piccioli touches, whether that’s a simple pleated skirt or hooded cape.

Hi Evangelie,

Valentino has become, no doubt, my favourite designer. He understands sensuality in a very elegant way. 

Lots of love

When I closed my eyes I could almost hear the olive leaves rustling in an August summer breeze at the temple of Poseidon. I could stay there the whole night watching the full moon rising above the bay…

The unexpected moments in fashion that touch your heart, these exact moments that make you feel extremely proud.

Thank you Karl Lagerfeld for still believing (and creating) in the real, timeless beauty right in the age of numbers. And thank you for making me feel like I am at home in the middle of Paris. My home is your home and this is our ideal Greece.

Stunning! Absolutely love it!

As someone who has hyperpigmentation, I have to be really careful under the sun - especially in the tropics. I obsess with creams, sunblock and hats, and now I found a product that has been the most efficient to date. Chanel’s  SUBLIMAGE La Protection UV SPF 50 is both potent and delicate, which takes the best care of your skin so you can be carefree during your time off!

I usually have super chapped lips so a little trick of mine is to apply a bit of lip balm before the lipstick. However, even since my lips have gotten acquainted with Coco Rouge, they have never felt more hydrated! This new lipstick by Chanel is both nurturing and packed with gorgeous pigment, my favourite being number 444 Gabrielle. Juicy cherry lips all Summer baby!

The Chanel Fall 17 Haute Couture show left me not only with memories from a beautiful collection, it also left behind a marvellous scent - the new Gabrielle Chanel perfume. With tones of orange blossom, jasmine, yilan yilang, tuberose and white flowers, it smells fresh and modern. If elegance were a fragrance it would be the new Gabrielle Chanel, and her words do still echo and inspire the Maison’s creations, "Elegance comes from being as beautiful inside and outside.”.

Give your nails the best summer treatment and go for Chanel's 562 Coralium polish. I'm wearing it non-stop, it's a fab shade and an even more fab mood-fixer. xx

The highlighter I’m obsessing over right now  - the Illuminator adds radiance and a beautiful shimmer to your face. Just dab a little of the product on the highest point of your cheeks for some extra luminosity and you’re ready to face the warmer season.

On-theme, many of the tweed jackets and dresses were covered in clear hoods, ponchos and coats – including gorgeous plastic boots and bags. Plastic is making quite the comeback and will definitely make a splash next season.

This was such a perfect way to finish Paris Fashion Week – talk about saving the best for last!



I was absolutely in love with this Chanel show! The environment and the clothes, absolutely breathtaking.

I really love going out by wearing only a stand-out lipstick. And by stand-out I mean a deep powerful shade, a lipstick that stays on the lips and doesn't move around (to your teeth etc). For this season my very favorite shades are from Chanel Rouge Allure Ink. They are super, super long lasting, matte but not dry. Depicted you can see my personal loves but also shades that I believe they match with every single skin. Enjoy.

From left clockwise.

AMOUREUX #140

 LIBERE #148

CHOQUANT #152

EXPERIMENTE #154

You've asked I listen...so on "Do it like E" posts we apply my favorite and super easy beauty tricks on different persons. Let's get started people with triangles. I'm always super lazy with my make-up and I have invented this way of going out wearing ONLY eyeliner and looking fresh. I just draw a small triangle ending exactly at the middle part of my lash line. That's it. It uplifts my eyes(and the whole face) making it look fresh n' sexy in no-time. Just remember to use the most stable eyeliner to avoid transferring to your upper eyelid. My favorite Calligraphie De Chanel n. 65 hyperblack. The best.

The most wanted lips created by Peter Philips with these simple steps: "Apply a beige pencil, this makes the lips dryer and erases the natural lip tone, that way you don't see the red of the lips underneath. Then you smoosh the glitter on, clean up the edges with clear tape, and finish by pressing a tissue over the mouth." There you have it. All shine.

Lip liner Charlotte Tilbury

Glitter OCC

A breath of freshness that radiates citrus, a sense that brought back all of my restless childhood memories. Happiness... that’s all a perfume is about right?

Spending severals days in the slopes of the French Alps was a dream even for me, not by any means a professional skier (surprise surprise). This ski trip was no ordinary ski-trip though – usually you enjoy the snowy slopes on them but I got to experience the mountains from ABOVE. We went on private helicopter ride and soaked in the breathtaking view of the majestic mountain tops.

Net-A-Porter is the definitely the host with the most surprises, events, atmosphere, love and last but not least – with the best wardrobe for every occasion.

Check out my winter essentials below!

I chose a pair of gorgeous, red suede pumps with  playful tassels from Aquazzura that I paired with wide high-waisted pants and a cozy over-sized knitted sweater from Joseph.

And for those occasions when you want to channel your inner intergalactic 60’s bombshell these low blue sparkly booties from Pedder Red are perfect.

I also went for these glamourous, sparkly pumps from Jimmy Choo as well. Whether you wear them with wide pants or a cute little number, they’re your go-to party Choo’s (hah!).

Last but not least, I also fell in love with these velvet, emerald green, everyday boots. I feel like velvet isn’t just a fad but here to stay, and boy am I glad it is!

Wow. These pictures are stunning and so high level. You are very classy and creative.

The #VLTNTokyo pop-up in Shibuya blows EVERY other pop-up out of the water. Valentino threw the best party in town (KOHH performed, need I say more?) with the most gorgeous exclusive items such as accessories, basket balls and even yoga mats.

I was also met by an array of belted pouches and got myself the #FreeRockstudSpike white one which is to die for. I usually place these babies over my shoulder when I’m wearing a dress and around my waist when wearing low-waisted pants.

If you’re in Tokyo, do NOT miss to check out the pop-up at the QC CUBE, 4-21-8 Jingumae Shibuya-ku.



Wow! Beautiful!

What I love about Delpozo collections in particular is that the concept runs through all looks, and entire looks – head to toe, making every detail worth our attention. My favorite looks were with the playful, bicolored tulles and head pieces.

Thank you Josep for the splash of fun and beauty during New York Fashion Week!



I admire his work! Well written article as well!

Love the collection! Especially the colours used in the designs <3

Kickstarting a month full of shows with the most spectacular, brilliant one, that history has written yet.
Yes I’m well aware of the aforementioned words because in all honesty guys, it will be quite hard for anyone to overcome Mirabilia Romae‘s epic proportions.
On a personal level, since 2011 that I’ve started blogging, there are times (a lot) that it really feels like living in a dream but cross my heart, nothing and I mean NOTHING had prepared me ever for this, the goosebumps, the emotion and the thrill of watching Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli’s Haute Couture astonishing creations marching at Piazza Mignanelli.
So wanna take a ride with me? Get in our golf cart. Yes, this was the exact vehicle that took us around to the ten different Mirabilia Romae’s spots, where Valentino’s creations were placed in these “secret” yet magical locations right in the heart of the city’s historical part. The thing about the past is that we often don’t realize how much affects our future until it’s zoomed in front of us. And that’s exactly what Maria Grazia and Pierpaolo wanted to show with Valentino‘s pieces displayed in the parts of Rome that inspired their existence. It was incredible going through them all, a trip to the past that everything made much more sense. And my personal favourite…the depicted Casanatense Library with the astonishing Cyclopean globes and an army of line-up dolls in the middle of the room , a treasure-trove of embroidered ensembles triumphantly standing in the palatial silence.

After the historic delight I had to return fast to my hotel and get ready for the show. My dress, the most beautiful dress I’ve ever worn was already in the room, hung in its bag. I unzipped slowly the bag spending a couple of minutes just staring at it. It was so delicate but simultaneously much heavy by its own craftmanship. Thousand of perfectly placed stones, embellished all-over it to tell its story, “a summer night under the Roman trees”, maybe?
As for the show itself, allow me to say, that Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli’s touch gave a life force to the Spanish Steps. A stitch in time.The collection was remarkable, balancing gracefully between past, present and future. A tribute to Rome’s legacy and a not-so-silent message for all of us:
THERE ARE TIMES THAT YOU MUST LOOK BACK TO GO FORWARD.

I feel so much gratitude for experiencing Mirabilia Romae and I will never, ever forget that I’ve watched Emperor return to his very own Rome.

This must have been one of those jaw dropping shows, not only the gorgeous collection, but also the back drops to it all. Thanks for giving us a glimpse of the beauty.
Hugs Adele xoxo

My clan, stayed together for the whole night all clad in our chic yet comfy Thakoon sleepwear, having most probably one of the best nights of my life. A lot of champagne, a lot of laughter and A LOT of gossiping. I have missed them so much….Oh I forgot, let me introduce you properly. Please meet Mara and Lydia. My girls.

 

In partnership with Thakoon.

“A new beginning demands a certain forgetfulness. In order to rewrite history one should forget about it and retain the essence, moving quickly and irreverently to explore the pleasures of metamorphosis.
Actions should be quick, guided by taste that edits, chooses, combines, unites: elongating, narrowing, keeping time as a value on the surface of things; stripping away of the superfluous to add intensity.
Eras should be crossed in an accelerated supercut, drawing an imaginary line that brings Hieronymus Bosch, the visionary inventor of fantastic heavens and hells, close to Sandra Rhodes, who has been invited to reinterpret the artist’s imagery with her pure and innocent lines.”

That said from Pierpaolo Piccioli on his debut show as the sole creative director of Valentino. I won’t talk much, I will just let you feast your eyes on his breathtaking collection with only one wish….All the new beginnings to be like Pierpaolo’s: EPIC.

Impecable,la caida y los cortes son un sueño
Me guata el juego de los colores

The magic rests in the textiles of the pieces and subtle details, such as the satin ropes that held together the silk gowns. The collection was sublime – take my word for it.

As my favorite look from show oozes careless sophistication and a hint of romance, I styled it with the hat from look 11 – I love adding a bit of contrast in my looks.

Imagine one bare-foot week and snorkeling among a wild selection of coral just on the doorstep of your villa. Bonus...the best mochi in the world at the ZEN restaurant. Dreams actually exist.

With its own white-sand beach and surrounded by 5 spectacular forests, the Sarojin is the place that enables you to relax, unwind and recharge. Having one of the best guest services that I’ve ever witnessed, Sarojin is the ideal destination in Thailand. I’ll definitely be back.

Ganni shirt/Emilio Pucci shorts(via LuisaWorld)

Ph Haris Farsarakis

Still shamelessly Thailanding or for those who are not following my adventures on instagram( by the way, WHY?,perquè,pourquoi) I’m at my beloved palm-tree-land watching my toes getting darker and darker every day. Might be a fetish, but really not because when we have a fetish don’t we really know it? Like the other day a friend of my mine told me that she has just started a relationship with a double Gemini and I really wanted to grab and save her…

GURL!! Why are you doing this to yourself?

Yes I have (maybe) a fetish with horoscopes and I cannot hide it. With my aforementioned almost bad habit comes also the equally bad tendency to judge people by the dates they are born. I mean how many times have you lived the Cancer-woman drama or the stubbornness of an Aries?Bad-bid with a Virgo? Fall in love with the Aquarius’ mega-mind? Join the club.

And if you ask for my very own species I’m a fish, a Pisces, with ascendant in Leo, born just before the Aries clan begins so much of the aforementioned stubbornness characterises also me. In other news our beloved Susan Miller says that today is the luckiest day of the year! Shall we believe her? Let’s see…

 

I am absolutely in love with this shorts! 

minonimia.blogspot.com

Shit, SAME HERE. I’m so judgemental when it comes to zodiac signs.. I had a Gemini friend so I know literally everything about double faces and dual personalities. The stubbornness of an Aries? Been there, done that, got the t-shirt (but still wear it, so..). Also I’m always like “Dude, I’m an Aquarius, so that automatically makes me smarter than you” (kidding). But seriously, I’m a bit nervous when my horoscope says “Do not travel today” or even worse “Do not get in the car”…
I’m in love with the shorts, but really, where am I in this constellation, where’s the Aquarius?! 😉
You look stunning as always!

I’m a Scorpio!
Those shorts are amazing.

Such beautiful shorts!!! Talking about horoscopes I think that they often reflect  people’s  paricular features 🙂 As a born Aquarius I feel flattered about my “mega-mind” ;)) Enjoy Thailand!

I loved the volume and lack thereof in this collection – some body parts are exposed and some drown in massive ruffles and tulles. I found it to be provocative in an unexpected way, but expectedly the shoes were on fire as usual. Vaccarrello is a master of seduction and showmanship.



Evangelie this is such a beautiful review! I am an up coming Greek fashion blogger and you are what I aspire to become and achieve in this industry. If you could take some time and check out my blog http://www.portraitdelamode.com or Instagram (@portraitdelamode) it would be such an honor. I do reviews too! I love you so much 😘😘 Keep up the amazing work you do! It would be an honor to collaborate with you in any way.

Well current state of mind is also current state of body. VERY rare for me, we are honest on this space, remember? At this moment I’m lying on a bed at Maldives, next to hubby(who seems annoyed by the clicking noise), surrounded by an airy white tulle canopy. The canopy is always stuffed into our bed linen, a practice I guess for our own safety as the island’s ecosystem is massive.  If you don’t already know it, one of my biggest fears is to find a snake below my pillow… Nuts or not I’m still checking below it every single day. Anyway…This Maldivian island is a paradise. A leaving dream. And the resort here is just beyond. I promise will tell all it in a couple of days.

For now…I’m just enjoying it.

 

This picture is awesome. I love your site, really nice to read

Valentino jacket(via LuisaWorld)/Anine Bing shirt/Cheap Monday denim/Altuzarra sandals/Celine bag(not the same at all yet I adore this)
Ph Haris Farsarakis
The only garment that could support nudity and I mean that even if you are naked inside, nobody would actually care. Happy first of March lil fellas and what a better way to start this month with a statement jacket, probably my favorite pieces of the wardrobe. Pieces that remove all the unnecessary brainstorming of what to wear as all they need to be matched with is the maximum simplicity. And you must know by now the motto of this blog, no? Simplicity IS the greatest ability, yes, yes so far we haven’t changed here. So if a single jacket creates a sense of an absolute need, it is the greatest of all. A turtleneck, a t-shirt or a buttoned down can be easily paired, with the only required premise to be monochrome.. Let your statement jacked do the monologue, I am sure everybody will love its loud voice.


And…just because I adore them, below is my top list of the spring statement jackets. Enjoy!
[show_lookbook_widget id=”193078″]

Love your style and true fashionista..

From Singapore to India, to Paris, to Berlin and now back to Athens. My life has been a whirlwind lately plus a new space that went live almost two months ago. But I just wanted to drop a not-so-short line and say to all of you that it’s still my pen here and everything that I completely adore. From my braincells with love that is but in a new synchronous way, an inspirational magazine, a place that prioritizes the followers and not the clicks or the numbers. Thus on the new styleheroine.com you won’t see a labyrinth of pages and windows. Everything is on the home page, crystal clear and very friendly to your sanity. So I really wanted to drop a hello, to ask you how do you find my new me and that yes editorials will be back on track not because I’ve missed my voice, my high-pitched voice is still here but because I have missed yours. Now shoot me, tell all.

Dress by Isabel Marant

Booties by Celine

Wow this is such a wonderful editorial, all the pictures look so stunning.

Celine dress|
 Balenciaga boots

Photography Haris Farsarakis

A lot has happened in my life since I last logged in styleheroine. Please try to follow me, I went to Miami for a private, beautiful dinner with Matches Fashion, stayed four days there making the most of the beach, met my friends and finally spent some quality time away from the fashion weeks, on my way back home I’ve stayed 14 hours at the airport because the BA plane’s engine couldn’t get fixed, I fell hard off the lounge’s sofa with my plate(and the pasta) dropping onto my head, I nursed my husband as he got super ill, of course I got him well and the last three days I’m shooting the new campaign for By Malene Birger. Yes life is a roller coaster, 2 weeks passing by like 2 minutes and one month like three. For what it’s worth I’m taking you back to Paris in a glimpse of an eye. What was I saying?



Love it!!!

Amazing dress and so stylish outfit! You look great!

Their Spring Summer 2018 collection cemented the brand’s American-cool DNA and there was also a hint of romanticism this time around with silk ribbons, florals, ruffles and ruched tulle tube dresses, perhaps affected by couture atmosphere.

Proenza Schouler made a splash in Paris and its ripples are glamorous.



What a beautiful collection. Proenza Schouler never disappoints.

My go-to brand for style-proof, beautiful separates is Joseph. My love for the British brand is passed down to me from my mother, and now it’s hotter than ever thanks to its never failing coolness.

First look at Salle Privée! It’s a luxury brand for men created by Patrick Munsters and as you guys know I love dipping my foot in the menswear pool - coats especially as they have that impeccable tailoring, cut and oversize feel.

It’s been a dream of mine to go to Tokyo for a very long time, and get to stay at the Andaz Tokyo Hotel made it all the more special. A couple of days isn’t nearly enough to explore the city and thanks to the beautiful view from my room, I could soak up the grandeur of Tokyo and it’s buzzing life from the comfort of my bed. The most notable things however was the impeccable service and delicious food!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Thailand is one of my favourite countries to visit during the summer, even though there’s a chance for a bit of rain during this time of the year. I love the serenity and peace that one finds near the water, and the beautiful sounds of nature in the forest. Since it can get hot, humid and wet all at the same time, it’s not an easy destination to pack for. My tip is to go for white linen pants and wide white shirts, that can keep you cool and covered at the same time. I like to break the monochrome look with colourful earrings, such as the ones from Oscar della Renta. Other things I wore during this trip are: 

Straw bag by Rosie Assoulin,

Black and orange swimming suit by Eres, 

White dress by Solace London, 

White top by Zimmermann, and Prefall Celine pants.

Leather pants Calvin Klein jeans|
 Top Calvin Klein jeans

Photography Haris Farsarakis

Why finding the surreal fit on leather pants is a mental struggle?…I bet y’all know. Leather pants are not much forgiving. 

You ate cake last night? They are silently judging you. However what I’ve found (and I KNOW  you trust me) is that the classic shapes are the ones who flatter most. And who’s the master of classics? Yes the iconic Calvin Klein has revived his leather line with the Rebel Edge Limited Edition collection. The struggle is over guys! I swear they fit so so good! And because some thoughtful styling is always welcomed, the collection has been enriched with the perfect teammates for the leathers, which are no other than the simple cotton tops.  Like? I love!

Enjoy!

love those shoes!

I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again - Gabriela Hearst knows what women want and how they want to feel. This chiffon-trimmed velvet dress has the perfect cut and fit - it emphasises the right parts and shows just enough to make you feel a queen.

I didn’t plan for this but when the stars align, your Eres swimsuit matches the Wes Anderson-inspired beach chairs at the One&Only Resort in Dubai, and voilá - magic happens! Expect nothing less when staying here, as the resort is truly magical and unique.

Underneath thousands of paillettes lies a silk-georgette slip that feels incredibly luxe and smooth, in true Miu Miu spirit. The spaghetti straps and split on the side are pleasant details and make this the ultimate va-va-voom piece.

One might expect floral patterns and colorful palettes from Resort collections, often shown in exotic places; more commercially conscious separates and accessories tend to dominate the line-ups.

As Pierpaolo Piccioli does, he marched to the beat of his own drum and showed a collection that was as fresh as it was modern – free of clichés and full of brilliant new ideas that unfailingly tread the line between romantic and cool.

The color blocking was irresistible, and my personal favorite was the long-sleeved, midi-dress in red and pink. I don’t usually wear pink but when I do…


great pictures

Milo means “apple” in Greek. 

The nightmare of my childhood years  became the star of my editorial. How times change… The fact is that I loved apple pies yet I hated eating apples. And I’ve been really tired of my mom chasing me with a fork around the house and a slice of this crunchy, nasty fruit on its end. Crunch, crunch, crunch. Yikes! I would only eat them with a lot of honey and cinnamon. Like another cake I guess.  How about you? It’s good to know it’s not just me…. Luckily enough I like Macs and Iphones. Only Steve Jobs created the best Apple ever!!!

Haha! I hate eating raw apples too, they taste so …cheap (if that makes any sense) . I thought it was just me! 🙂        XXX   https://chasingthewhiterabbitblog.com/

Proenza Schouler top/ Vetements jeans/ Gucci loafers
 The shoot took place at The Landmark Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong
 Photography: Sun Sun Leung

Creative direction: Evangelie Smyrniotaki

I come back in a full, sincere, apologetic mode because this time it’s been almost two weeks since my last shout out. It’s not only that I’ve been on vacation but it’s mostly that styleheroine.com is growing fast and I’m just one human being handling everything by my own. So it’s finally time to admit that I need urgently an assistant and maybe the new year’s resolution should be to find one. Go ahead fellas, spread the news and most importantly email me. And maybe, who knows, we’ll be together in the future.  Sounds romantic yet…it’s not!  

Let’s go back to the Oriental side of life and the mesmerizing Hong Kong which unfortunately I have to salute today, one of the cities that honestly I could  stay for the rest of my life. I’ve had this discussion with a friend there and I’ve asked her why do some residents keep complaining about living in such a beautiful city. Her answer was probably the most obvious one, that massive cities like Hong Kong demand never-ending working hours and people don’t have the time to enjoy the beauty of their surroundings. True words yet allow me to say that there’s always time to appreciate beauty. Don’t ever think that things are given and cannot change. Everything can change anytime so take five minutes and enjoy the sparkling sky line of this astonishing city, a glorious proof of what human minds can achieve.

On another-style note if there was one piece that could fit any body type that would certainly be the off-shoulder. I love that comes back in fashion a design almost from medieval ages. Wow, it would be such a scandal to show some shoulder those  days.  Nowadays naaaaah. Neither nudity is scandalous anymore. Of-shoulders are clean, broaden shoulders and elongate the neck almost a magic wand in your hands.  You need this wand no? I certainly do.

Amazing pictures, love it! x

If there’s only one thing to buy for this fall then these boots will definitely mirror your face everytime you stare at the floors.

Crushing on crushing the Labor day rule and wearing white pants at the Chanel S/S18 show in Paris! No one does black and white like Karl Lagerfeld, making the classic feel exciting again.

Known firstly for creating it-perfumes, now Byredo-founder Ben Gorham presents his new it-bags. Just like his scents, the Seema handle bags are minimal: simple in shape and surprising in level of comfort. Gorham breaks new ground and strikes gold.

*Lame(λαμέ): shiny fabrics or the excessive use of sequins(the Greek way)

Saturday night, my favorite day since I have actual memories and that tiny part of the week when my most beloved outfits got out of the closet for a stroll or for a dance marathon If I got lucky. And I really loved(and still love) to dance, have I ever told you that? WHEN on the dance floor I’ve had the energy of a Duracell bunny and Rihanna’s moves at the Barbados Carnival Parade. Blame it ONLY on my greek genes. My (very)dancing ones.
So this post is for all of you who ask me what to wear during the hottest nights of the week without feeling overdressed.
-Wait a minute lady, you are all over sequins and you are not feeling over-freakin-dressed? You must be drunk!
Well I am 100 percent alcohol free and I can reassure you that if you wear your most glamorous dress, the Holly Grail of your closet, your shine-bright-as-a-diamond armour(yes we listen a lot of Rihanna on this blog) paired with a simple, plain black pair of ballerinas then not only you won’t feel overdressed but you’ll also look as chic as one very modern Jackie-O. And even when it happens to be amongst the super tall Danes, like I was for the past few days, that’s not a bummer, you won’t be that dwarf, you’ll be the coolest million-dollar-babe ready who knows how to look beautiful even in loads  and I mean LOADS of sequins.

Love this pictures!! The dress is super cool!

Special Edition FelderFelder for Silhouette sunglasses, Valentino dress, Valentino bag.
Ph Melanie Galea
No mom as much as you try to brainwash me, I have not returned back to my natural roots. The depicted awesomely sunwear-ed me is looking back to the previous fashion week, when the super talented Melanie Galea  shot me at the undoubtedly most beautiful bridge in Paris, Pont Alexandre III.

The Felder twins translated their signature style into a bespoke selection of glasses called Special Edition FelderFelder for Silhouette and me and Melanie found the chance to celebrate it just after the magical Valentino show dressed in the House’s stealthy perfection. Looking back, I am so looking forward to times like these….


I love you so much better with darker hair *-*

Wow, classy and cool! I love your make up, thats perfection!

Burberry trench coat/Vetements Denim/Vetements turtleneck/ Gucci loafers/ Rag & Bone camisole. Bag by Mark Cross.

Love a good wi-fi connection on plane.

Who would’ve ever thought that someone would  actually communicate, in our case post, from the airspace. Sounds extraterrestrial yet this is real human evolution guys. I hope next year to speak on this space about finding cures and miracle medicines. It will make me so much happier.

So here I am on my way back home from Los Angeles, having a panic attack (and if I’m not I’m almost there), not because of the altitude but because I’ve realized that I haven’t talked to you at all about my Burberry trench coat experience at the Landmark Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong the only Mandarin Oriental in the world with a silver fan (the rest of them have gold).

At the beginning of January I’ve had the great pleasure to stay at their redesigned and absolutely beautiful suite L900 to experience five Burberry-ultra-spoiling days. The MO Landmark joined forces with the iconic British house and until the end of February all the guests of this suite may wear the heritage Burberry trench coat and enjoy the “My Burberry” fragrance during their stay, complementing with an exclusive private in-suite styling consultation. I totally loved this experience. The suite was beyond chic in cool neutrals, like white and grey, that gave it a contemporary appeal and a mix of vintage-modern furniture. Not to mention the pal next door who was no other than the Landmark mall, one of the best shopping destinations globally.

What? Need some Hong Kong getaway? I totally get it….

Hi, Love your look as always. I was just wondering which nailcolour your wearing…

Thanks a lot

The Burberry trench is such a classic I adore. The hotel suite looks gorgeous, it must have been a wonderful visit.
Hugs Adele xoxo

lovely pics!

From hair to waist, all sky-high everything…

My hair does suffer from some kind of mysterious blonding curse which graciously gifted my scalp with a few new pairs of well-groomed cockroach’s antennae to sense NY’s high-vibes. YES, I won’t lie, my hair has been broken. Almost platinum’s side effects have eventually showed up. When it comes to hair though nothing is irreversible or non fixable as long as I keep in mind my mom’s biggest beauty secret that is no other than pure olive oil. DON’T EAT IT, at least don’t do it before applying it directly to your hair, leave for an hour or so and then clean it away only with shampoo at the beginning  and then rinse it with water. Before ditching the idea of smelling like a Greek salad, just remember that it really works. Moms know better, been there, said that…

In another news my seasonal search for the highest waisted pants has happily-ever-after ended in NY by finding DAT awesomeness. By DAT I mean the depicted Rodarte. They are the highest of all, the Burj Khalifa of the pants and before you rush to judge me, yes that’s good. The highest the waistline rests above your hips, the tallest you’ll look. That simple. Just remember…size up on these jeans. They are so, so tight and on this blog…well, we don’t want you to suffer….



New York really agrees with you, you look so chic ! Love the flats and jacket, and olive oil did wonder to your hair !
http://www.pardonmyobsession.com/

I am getting more and more into high waisted jeans. It’s true, it makes you look taller, sitting just below the waistline is perfect! and they are so comfortable! I love the outfit.;-). You used to be a brunette and now you are a blondie, either way, when  ones hair is damaged, olive oil is the  ultimate solution to restore its shine and health! mommas around the world and styleheroine, thanks for the tip !!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Valentino bomber(via LuisaWorld)/Rag & Bone denim/ Saint Laurent boots/ Alexander McQueen ring.

Photography Haris Farsarakis

Battle of ages. HOW-TO survive a case of a severe blizzard situation without looking like the otherwise lovable hippopotamus that searches for love food at a distant lakeshore.

Well on this space, we are the fiercest ones, and we’ll go with the bomber and layer it. We might end-up looking like an onion but never like the happy hippo.

So when I’ve been asked by the dearest Farfetch to select my favorite items from Luisa World for the upcoming season, there could be no-other than the coolest Valentino bomber with the even cooler gang on its back, on the top of my list. It’s awesome no? I’ve been eyeing on this since the very moment I saw it on vogue’s pages three months ago and now tadaaaa in store, a proof that times goes by so quickly! I guess in no-time there will be summer again..Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight
Are you with me, are you with me?

I’m so with you on this piece Evangelie, it’s stunning & looks gorgeous on you. Really pleased bombers are back on trend.
Hugs Adele xoxo

Black boot Chloe, Snake-skin boot Isabel Marant, Burgundy boot Marni (all via Luisa World)

And god created the medium heel!

Or better one major army of the “in-between” feet-supports because the medium heeled boots, yes my friends are so trending for the upcoming season. And it was about time if you ask me. In fact I’ve always wondered why the four-to-eight-cm were until lately a rare species for the design houses. It’s been always flat or hight. All or nothing. However the new medium size adjustment  to the heel gives form to our everyday comfiness and highlights a certain vision of femininity. For me our boot-to-go shouldn’t resemble to a basketball player’s pair of kicks to look cool and feel comfy too. It should be this kind of boot that of course it would be majorly walkable yet with an addition that should give to the silhouette a flattering and elegant notion. And this addition is no other than this specific MEDIUM heel. Our feet will not suffer anymore just to look feminine YAYYYYY….the new season’s must have is made for walking and they simply adore it.

 

You can find my favourite medium-helled boots below:

Celine dress(via LuisaWorld)(similar here)/Celine shoes(similar here)/Saint Laurent bag/ Botier Official earing
Ph Haris Farsarakis

Hello from the beautiful Dallas and the awesome Reward Style conference. Currently enjoying/phototosynthezing the Texan sun and utterly motivated to talk about our summer’s hero pieces(and perhaps the winter’s ones if you’ll take a look at Isabel Marant’s newest collection) the striped dresses. Who wants a dress to wear everywhere?  Raise your hand! I’m pretty certain that all hands around this block are already up in the air. Your vehicle to drive you unmistakably around the day (or night) is printed…. horizontally. A refuge for the sleepy morning brain cells which do refuse to decide matchy matchy pieces or dinner outfits. Striped dresses are our not-so new hero pieces, our time savers, our chic boosters. Woo-hoo!

Raey fine knit/Raey skirt/Saint Laurent belt/Celine shoes.

Ph Haris Farsarakis

Monument to Overseas Combatants, of the Colonial Wars, Fortress of Good Success (Forte do Bom Sucesso), Belem, Lisbon.

Kick starting my Portugal tour by saluting a fine British act, an act that apparently made my appearance no less than impressive at the absolutely mesmerizing surroundings of Lisboa. Raey alongside with Portugal have been both the most pleasant surprises during the past week.

Raey is actually the newborn of matchesfashion.com. I guess their many years of experience in the fashion industry have been proved extremely fruitful because guys I swear, on my blogger’s honor, they are killing it. Clean lines combined with the best materials, a somehow hard-to-get match out there. You absolutely have to experience their fine cashmere knits. If you close your eyes and face the sun, they do feel like a spring day in Portofino, a perfect escape, what fashion should be all about…..

Click below to see my top choices from Raey collection.

Ph Fransiska Olivia

Hand’s up who’s up for a ride! Cause If we are gonna build a time machine, that would be definitely in a car(stolen from Back to the Future).

So back to time and altogether we head to North, towards the Vikings ex-territory(obviously I am also obsessed with these series) and the most beautiful Copenhagen. It has been a couple of months ago and the chill season had just started but I could still stroll around the city in my personal favorite outfit from By Malene Birger’s Winter 15 collection. Straight from the catwalk, blending with the grey bricks of the city, By Milene ‘s totally relaxed approach to menswear, came to prove that yes, the Queen of women suits actually exists. And apparently is Danish. All hail the Danish Queen!!



 

Stunning suit! Great combo with a brown bag!

You wear that suit like nobody’s business ! Absolutely stunning and brilliant as usual !

Back and fourth like a ping-pong ball we go on this blog. But some of us we find it kinda amusing, exactly like the aforementioned game. So here I am again, virtually this time, strolling around the city of future. I don’t really mind the humidity, it actually opens up my pores and detoxifies my skin or the 70000 Singapore Dollars needed to obtain the licence to drive your car for ten years(yes you’ve heard well). I WANT Singapore to adopt me! Please do! I’ll be a good girl. I might start wearing some pink if you’ll ask it. As long I can wake up to this views every single day. Singapore is in my heart and every time I come back it’s always different. Better in a way. This city celebrates the miracles that humanity can make. And we really can. Just look around take a deep breath and think tha everything is possible…

Lately in Mykonos my life is totally under these visors. You have to admit it though, the convertibles of the hats might easily give you a sunstroke however they are the chicest way to watch the funky islanders. Eyes (almost) wide shut and behavioral observation. Oh and some Rose… a whispering one for my friends in LA that already miss so much. You probably don’t understand a thing…or you do?

The everlasting question during my interviews is what fashion means to me. Well fashion or style for me is a mood fixer. A psychotropic pill to my soul with no side effects. So every time fashion’s mega minds try to over-analyze industry’s trends, designers’ brand-hopping etc…I would suggest to just let them do their beautiful work, to provide to us what they’re supposed to…happiness.

Altuzarra sandals (also here) and in black.

Ph Haris Farsarakis

And by T I don’t mean Tequila season. It would be nice though.

So when it comes to heels the biggest hit of the spring is the T-bar, the very welcomed sometimes tick, other times thin, vertical strap. In the shoe-theory of the limb elongators, they are the catalysts. Yes, you have to believe me, It’s my own, almost academic, case study. T-straps do show your legs longer. And according to Mara’s own words “Have you ever seen a dancer with short legs? This is the dance-shoes evolution girl!”

Below is my top T-team. Enjoy!

 Blush Sunkiss Ribbon
 Eyeliner Stylo Yeux Waterproof Fervent Blue
 Lipstick Rouge Coco Shine Mighty

Nails Le Vernis Nail Gloss Sunrise Trip

I don’t consider myself as one of those notorious beauty experts but let’s be honest girls,  in the world of makeup and skin care nobody is considered completely an expert as there is not one universal skin type. However I love to speak for my very own experiences, when I try new makeup collections or skin care, I, a woman with reactive, sensitive skin, with enlarged pores that occasionally suffers from severe allergies.

When it comes to makeup Chanel is one of the brands that my skin swears on for years.  So when the new collections hit the stores, all of my beauty cells well, cheer up!

The newly launched S16 collection is a fresh, joyful color pallet that captivates the alluring essence of the Spring . I’m absolutely sold on the Sunkiss Ribbon blush. I don’t usually use it as a blush to highlight my cheekbones as they are already enhanced by mother nature and sometime I feel I look weird when I try to contour them but I sweep it over my entire face, delivering the depicted healthy (and always wanted) glow. For foundation I use Les Beiges no 20 (my favorite lately) that I also use as a concealer, yes you heard it well, I find remarkable how it beautifully brightens up my dark circles. However I’m one of the lucky ones who don’t suffer of severe undereye situation so I suggest for those who do, to try this foundation under your eyes but also apply your concealer only toward the edges.

Last but not least I’ve surprised myself with the vibrant Fervent Blue eyeliner, yes for the first time ever I’ve tried blue color on eyes and the verdict…it’s a genius styling trick that I’ve never actually though about it. It can elevate your monochromes in zero time. A very, very welcomed spring surprise.

Yesss, finally beauty post and it’s the best of the best! Colorful, fresh, very “spring”… I’ve really been waiting for it. And this Chanel collection looks so juicy! Thank you for another inspiring beauty editorial:)

Awwww I’m glad you liked it Isabel.

Ellery Coat/Ellery dress(check out this beauty)/Ellery shoes. All from Ellery Fall15 collection.

Botier Official earring.

Ph Carin Olsson

Even though I am currently touring Portugal’s mesmerizing shores (post-avalanche is coming soon) I didn’t want to do the long distance thing, you know the communication-non-existence-eventually-separates-couples thing. So here I am, giving you a life-sign, by popping you up in Paris. Yes my reality has been a bit complicated lately, with a lot of traveling and some short(thank god) drama. Yet Paris is always a good idea, especially if it’s depicted by Carin’s photography. Back to our usual ftopics*, Ellery has been lately my favorite Aussie. This girl is not only a remarkable designer but also a stunner. To be honest with you before meeting Kym Ellery in Paris, I hadn’t done my homework properly thus I had never actually checked how did she look like. So when I’ve been introduced to her during my visit at Ellery’s Parisian showroom I was stunned. A beautiful young woman who looked nonchalantly cool in her own designs. A muse for her own collection. And then it hit me. How rare it really is that the designers to create their collections having in mind not only to please their market but also themselves? To wear and feel confident in their own creations? If you actually think that the majority of the design houses have as their creative directors men, then the answer is obvious. And if you ask me if that’s one of the ingredients of a massive-success-formula well…when combined with talent and good aesthetics, I will answer YES…it can be, and Kym has it all.


*fashion-topics



 

Be careful, in french when a woman says you’ve found my button, it has another signification… Very daring, if you follow my meaning. Lol.
I love your work, keep it up.
Take care.

We do love great clothes, after all that’s why we’re all here. But if clothes could speak in common language, they’d tell you that they do unconditionally love a fit-body and even more a fit-mind.

My newest collaboration with Net-A-Porter was a challenge for me. A challenge to wake-up my body. Net-A-Sporter just on time for the fashion weeks has  launched the 7-day body reboot program, per me an absolutely genius program to feel strong like a heroine again.. You know a couple of weeks ago I was vacationing on the best spot on earth to be uber lazy. So I’ve returned kinda…disoriented…unfocused…jelly bean for god’s sake.

Net-a-porter’s 7 day body reboot was my rehabilitation.  A smart, no-time-consuming training and dietary program that made me feel awake again all of my forgotten muscles. Strength, mobility, intensity and restoration workouts coordinated with the most delicious-healthy menu. It was not easy…the first two days I was fantasizing myself walking down Jardin des Tuileries wearing hot-pants to stay focused. Yet trust me this program is genius and your body will eventually remember and master all the moves.

Now do tell me…I got my lines back, No?

Your exclusive guaranteed beautifying schedule is live now on Net-A-Sporter.

You can get my fitness uniform below:

The trainers are amazing, and you have definitely inspired me to work out more often!! You look great!

Wow! You have an amazing body Evangelie! Do you work out a lot? Love the top & those trainers are fab! Love how they tie round the ankle. Another great collaboration!

 Top, culottes and bag Valentino Pre-Fall 14/Shoes Prada

Ph Timur Emek

And if we pretend to have wings on our backs, we begin to actually feel that we are flying.

The week kicks-off with an incurable reminiscing mood of the Parisian Fashion Week times, when I was wearing my blouse backwards(no drinking involved) and everything was fine. Yes you heard that right! That Valentino glorious insect was originally meant to rest on my chest. But then I’ve thought who in the world does rest during Fashion Weeks and turned things upside down. Gave my back some pretty wings to flyyyyy! Do try this at home but be careful because not all blouses have Valentino’s tailoring to permit such actions. You don’t want to end up looking like the Exorcist, get it? Head turn guys, you haven’t ever watched the horror?

The Valentino A/W 14-15 show itself  was impeccable, a sartorial delirium, an endless wish list! It’s not easy(at all) to overcome yourself and each time Maria Grazia Chiuri & Pierpaolo Piccioli they do, evolving their artistry to the very Haute Couture limits. Seems that ready-to-wear has turned a point. All I can say is that If there’s it’s a sin in the fashion world to characterize a House as your favorite one then I will be a sinner. Yes Valentino is MY LOVE!


 

 

 

Beyond babe! Xx

A bid big kiss to you Tilda <3

As someone always in denial of colder times, I decided to pull out my Balenciaga F/W17 pants in the summeriest color I could get my hands on. I also love that they have side stripes that elongate my legs and add a bit of a sporty element to my look. Style them with a pair of pumps and pointy-toed boots!

I’m a sucker for playful proportions, all things red and cuddly sweaters - so yeah, it’s safe to say that this oversized Balenciaga turtleneck ticks all boxes and becomes this week’s Crush!

 Levis vintage denim|
 Balenciaga booties

Photography Haris Farsarakis

If you think about it,  A.W.A.K.E brand has been created by Natalia Alaverdian just after a year I have started working on this space, thus you can’t call it actually new. However if a piece of cloth makes you wanna go pole-swirling in the middle of the street, at rush hour, then that might meaning something about this brand. So meet the not only emerging but skyrocketing  A.W.A.K.E. Enjoy!

Hello I am so glad I found your site, I really found you by accident, while I
was looking on Google for something else, Regardless I am here now and would just like to say thanks for a incredible post
and a all round enjoyable blog (I also love the theme/design), I don’t have time to read through it all at
the minute but I have saved it and also included your RSS feeds,
so when I have time I will be back to read a great deal
more, Please do keep up the superb job.

love everything about this look – those gold shoes are gorg!!

Valentino top(similar in pink)/Valentino denim pants/Valentino sunglasses/ Gianvito Rossi flats/ Marni bag

Ph Haris Farsarakis

The shooting took place at Hotel Infante Sagres in Porto, Portugal.
Is it only me or whenever you also touch linen,  your biological blaring alarm clock surprisingly does sound like summer? If hitting the snooze button for the 10th time is your go-to solution to forget sunny days, in our case it simply does not work. Linen is the rare case of material connected with only one season. The aforementioned.

And vice versa, when I’ve been packing for Portugal, in the back of my mind I had the tropics and that simultaneously resulted the first thing chosen for my trip… linen.  That doesn’t necessary means that I’ve actually met the tropics…It has been very pleasant weather-wise but when the sun  went down, well you needed an EXTRA jacket.

So how cool guys are the Azulejos or else the Portuguese tiles? This post could be a photo gallery dedicated to their art but on an unexpected turn of corner my back, the Mega-Valentino-T did steal the lights. And I am not the kind of a girl obsessed with how her back looks. Imagine when a hairdresser brings over the mirror to check how the haircut from behind this usually ends up with me hysterically laughing, I mean who checks your hair from behind? They might check other parts of your body but hair?!  However there comes the time when good photography reminds me….that back actually matters and in the future, my nervous breakdowns should be eliminated only when slicing onions….True story.


You can find my top linen choices from Valentino below.

Ph Haris Farsarakis
Balenciaga skirt/Balenciaga sweater(Both via FreeShop-Balenciaga Mykonos)/Jimmy Choo flats.

I’ve heard that actually it’s cold in Paris…Am I right? I feel you my beloved Frenchies so here is one post dedicated to you.. Balenciaga Pre-Fall 15 for the breezy, almost wintery summer days. I know weather got cuckoo lately, no less nuts than me though, who I did sport this heavy armor in Mykonos. The  challenge has been the following: to choose my favourite outfit from the Balenciaga pop-up shop in the Cycladic island. An easy quest if I may because more or less I always know exactly which items I wish from the upcoming collections. And that angora sweater had stolen my heart from the moment I saw it popping out Vogue’s pages. This and a heartbreaking set of high-waisted pants with suspenders, a duo that still hasn’t been delivered to the stores. The truth is that I have a thing with the fluffy sweaters. If you think about it, they are the epitome of lazy-fall-dressing as you don’t need anything to cover-up, to get warm or to look gorgeous. They are too gorgeous and too warm on their own. As for the shirt…Maybe the easiest statement piece of the upcoming season. YAS! I adore this. Envelop-ing with these bicolor great yet non-binding buttons, ready to match with almost every-single top in my wardrobe because… as you already know it, I’m a black n’white girl…what can I do?!

Body and mind sync on the Parisian nights….

You can find my online picks from Balenciaga Pre-Fall 15 below:

Etoile Isabel Marant jumpsuit(also in khaki)/ Louis Vuitton belt/Converse trainers/ Saint Laurent bag(Inside the ALMOST fishnet)/Ray-Ban sunglasses

Ph Jeff Thibodeauco

It’s almost midnight, I’m almost hungry (because just a few days earlier it was a reasonable time for someone to eat lunch on the other side of the pond), I am almost sure that my depicted jumpsuit needed some ironing done and IT’S DEFINITELY SURE THAT I DONT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO PACK. Leaving again in just seven hours and you can see still totally empty my luggage’s bottom. Bottom’s up guys let’s have  a wine and make it fast. Wine gives you wings to fly!

 

 




You wear jumpsuits like no one else’s business ! Looking fierce, and that LV  belt is awesome !

Jacket N_8(via LuisaWorld)(check out also this beauty)/Saint Laurent shirt/Cheap Monday Denim/Celine bag(via Luisa World)
Ph Haris Farsarakis
Head in the clouds(literally and metaphorically) and one of my favorite combination kimono & shirt. That’s all for today.

 Two years have passed since the last time I wore this match and it really makes me wonder  a: why has it been so long and b: does time go faster as we get older? These are NOT logical questions that need answers. Actually don’t even think about at all. It’s Saturday folks, let’s just enjoy the spring-ish sun wearing a freaking awesome kimono….Breaking-free!


Nice look! Love your hair this way

Shirt custom-made/shorts & top Topshop/Hat Maison Michel(in a fab grey)/boots Chanel/Notebook and white leather bag Smythson

Ph Alex F

I believe in magic. Yes, I do. In the good one. And so it is. As I’ve already told you, I’ve been dreaming of this. I’ve been dreaming to be as awesome as it looks on its website’s pics. Because, you know, the real thing sometimes differ from the images. In our case, thank god, what you see is what you get. Pangkor Laut is beautiful. The private island reminds me a mix of “Lost” and “Blue Lagoon”. A two million years old rain forest, coupled with rocky outcrops and white powdery beaches. Our room is an over water villa. Trust me, sleeping under the wave sounds is the best remedy for the jet lag. Better than xanax. After all the previous introduction I can imagine that you’d like to see current neighborhood. No? My natural environment if I may…don’t you remember?! I’m a Pisces, a fishie.:)

More stories in the near future…for now…well the waves have already drugged me. Good night….

Love the look, big crush on the boots. Romi

Tote Smythson

Ph Alex F. Bag close-up by me.

I must have a packing syndrome. I honestly don’t know its name, yet there must be a word written about it in the psychology glossaries. That is when you pack your whole house, in the fear of missing something during your vacation. Yeap I’m a heavy-weight traveler. Except from one thing through: My bag. It is weird but when it comes to bags I try to take one (or maximum two with me) for all circumstances. From day to-night, to the beach or to our evening stroll. One hell of a multitasker. The “one”  that saved during my recent Southeast Asia trip was the depicted Smythson. A white large tote with a wave of canary-yellow inside, in other words a Kinder surprise. And you know how much I love surprises! Seriously!

 

We are in love with this bag!

Pretty bag!

J.W Anderson knit (here and here)/Vetements denim/Jimmy Choo boots.

Ph Haris Farsarakis

Edit by me.

The photo shoot took place at Cervo Zermatt

In this photo effects tutorial, learn how to easily blend with the environment. No, I’m just kidding guys, the background-blend-mode wasn’t on at that point of time. Not to even mention that I’m so bad at tutorials. SO terribly bad that actually makes me wonder when I’ll become a mom how I’m gonna teach my child(yes the future teller has predicted only one child for me, not that I’m complaining though) but I guess by then all biological alarms are gonna be ON alongside with the auto-pilot.

It was an accident. The shameless sync with the environment didn’t happen on purpose and I guess J.W. Anderson didn’t have in mind Zermatt’s slopes when designed this sweater. But then I  you can never actually know and at the end all that matters is what you see. So here is the one and only truth:

I’m an Alpine Chameleon. This is it. A very rare one…

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Jumpsuit Current Elliott,(also here), size down, here on size 0(check it in denim)/Tee Acne(favorite basic)/Boots Chanel/bag Smythson/Mono-earring Louis Vuitton.

Outfit pics Alex F, the rest by me.

Two words with a tab in the middle: Recovery-mode. There must be a pill.. A pill that instantly vanish your jet lag. If it really exists and it’s not my wild imagination’s yet another product , I’d like to know it…please!

Thewhole following week we will be all passengers in time, when I’ll take you back to my then tropical state of mind. It was my seventh time in Singapore. Seventh, I cannot believe that I’m actually saying that number or that it has been my 11th anniversary with my husband. 11 years together and while for some might seem like a lifetime, for me it feels like yesterday. Time passes quickly guys. But what is really time?  I have convinced myself that is just a human invention existing to stress us and put us in “boxes”. Can you imagine your life without the significant  existence of the time counter? Life as it supposed to be. Measured with feelings.

I suppose that all being mentioned above are obviously the side effects of my jet-lag. Anyway back at that day in Singapore and my usual habit to wear jumpsuits. Logically you’ll ask me:

Is n’t it too warm to wear in Singapore?

May I  answer with a question? Have you ever been inside a building in Singapore? The cold is insane. It’s like a local conspiracy to have the A/C on the skin-preserving-mode. Zero celsius that is. No joke. Thus these cotton Current Elliott all-in-ones were somehow  perfect for the circumstance. And while struggling to preserve my body temperature, I’ve unexpectedly found my number one wish on my fall list. It seems that they’d stocked earlier that the other capitals and the Louis Vuitton mono-earring was surprising available. Available and light-weight! Yes!!  My ears won’t suffer for fashion. Actually that’s partially true because my earring hole was closed in the back and my suffering while attempting to reopen it was insane. I had almost forgotten how massive the piercing pain was. And I have 10 ear holes, I should have known better(obviously the 8 of them closed)! While the salesman was watching me with terror, almost to bend the earring, he had the brilliant idea to bring over another pair of studs that could help for a better ear-drilling. After endless ear poking with a few breaks to pray….well that was it…the studs saved the day…

 

 

 

Congrats on your anniversary with your husband! LOve a good jumpsuit, Current/Elliott sure makes the best ones, so easy and yet not easy to pull it off so beautifully!

That jumpsuit is so on trend, love it!

You are totally rocking this military jumpsuit, the boots are a perfect match for it. I’ve also been to Singapore so I totally get you on the air con!! I also get you on time, I’ve been with my husband 18 years (married for 15 years) & I still can’t believe it when I say it!

This season we will celebrate “the longest the better” -the innocent way. How much do I really want to add some naughty emojis over here, however the serious notion of this blog puts an X to any scandalous thoughts.
 So if you didn’t get it already I am talking about long, long draped ties. Ties, longer than the average that add bit rhythmic-national-team drama to your hands however at the moment you will bend over to rub your dog’s ears you can easily trip on them saluting the floors. What a woman can do for fashion….great fashion tho.

😉😉😉😉

Outfit  is so gorgeous and the photographer is very professional cause your photos is so clear

Will surely try this trend….looks very intersting

You can find all the items in the depicted looks at Bergdorf Goodman’s Holiday Edit.

The moment you’ve all been waiting for has finally arrived, to see me in a role you’ve never seen me before, as a hostess with the mostess for the holiday season at the most iconic store on earth per me, the historic Bergdorf Goodman.
Dressed in stunning gowns at NY’s hidden gem, the beautiful(with maybe the greatest rooms I’ve ever seen)  Baccarat Hotel, I’m inviting you all to join me on a journey of pure sparkle and absolute NYC glamour, in an edit that will actually be quite a surprise for many of you. However I really don’t wanna spoil the surprise,  so meet me in BG‘s full-of-obsessions pages, wearing  nine gowns exclusively for Bergdorf Goodman to kick off the Holiday season together. See you in a bit!

 

In collaboration with Berfgorf Goodman.

 

Gorgeous pictures! I love all the beautiful dresses you’re wearing.

Haider Ackermann jacket(SS 13, found it at an insane sale price when in Departement Feminin)/Dries Van Noten shirt (similar here)/Mih-Jeans denim(new favorite)/Acne shoes/Jil Sander belt/Maison Mischel hat(same in grey also check this)

Now hear me out. I might not speak that loud during this Malaysian midnight yet I’ll try to be clear. There’s not any secret for turning the extreme frizzy dehydrated locks into straight ones(I adore straight hair) without using a dryer. We, the hair-balls, are on another level people. The medusa(s) level. Not any available technological advances are made for us yet. To be honest with you I have tried the Brazilian blow dry in the past but from shoulder and below…destruction…chaos…embers..do I need to say more? Plus If I haven’t already told you I’m hypochondriac and all these stories about the potential cancer risk had creeped me out. Just wear a hat girls. It works. Oh and straighten a bit your ends. It helps when you want to have a nice braid.

Enough with the hair-talk. Still in Malaysia, today we’ had our first burger! Don’t dare to judge me about my newscast! Life is pretty easy here. Not much drama..Well, except from the fact that my stomach is going to explode by the extensive use of Malaysian spices. Five days in a row are more than enough for my body’s, probably, most fragile area(my heart is excluded :p) . So the Pangkor Laut facilitates five restaurants with my favorite one, the Straits, a gourmet restaurant to dine in private booths literally on the rocks. A bit overpriced if you ask me, always judging by the Malaysian currency and the country’s economy. Apart from that the food was fab and the location insane!

You know the drill…it’s late..i have to go to sleep or else I might a need a helmet to look descent in the pics tomorrow….Goodnight…

Small checks are chic checks.

I concluded  to this after hours of contemplating if the all-time-classic motif does resemble to a picnic clothing. Well adorable fashion is not for us, no no no and the answer lies within the size. Gingham, in other words the small-checked cloth in white and a bold, in my case blue, color, is the most wanted one and it’s here to stay. I’m thrilled that (maybe) the most flattering pattern of the style dictionary is back. As I’ve confessed to you gazillion of times I hate it when patterns approach in less than 20cm distance near to my face. That’s not applied though to gingham. Much to my surprise its vivid motifs have the effects of the most delicious skin glowing smoothie. Oh yes, these small yet bold checks could dramatically(yet periodically) improve how your skin tone looks. Now I sound like a telemarketing ad…Do-you-believe-me?

I’ve been reading a lot about gingham – you’re the first blogger I follow to have featured it. I love the dress & the shoes look great un fastened.
Also adore the deep brown shade of your Celine.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Balenciaga Jacket (via Freeshop)/Heroine by Tom Wood shirt/Acne Studios leather pants/Balenciaga bag(via Freeshop)

Ph Haris Farsarakis

Back to basics, in childhood, when it has been a struggle for me to find a shirt shorter than my jacket. I really liked long tops but if my jacket did not cover over my shirt, my mom could not stop yelling “Oh it looks so bad” and  “no way my birdie to get out of the house like that”. Since little birdie loved her cropped bomber at that point of time, stuffing her blouses in her pants has been the unspoken rule to set her free. Yes…I wouldn’t exactly pronounce my school years rebellious but more “preppy”. Time-ages passed by, limits have been crushed and now my mom proudly sports thick lines showing under her own outerwear. Well if you ask me, I think that fashion’s own past has been full of borderlines and generous “no”, taboos and categorizations, all currently, thank god belong to the aforementioned past. Nowadays fashion is all about feeling confident in our own clothes and if that is my shirt to cover my bottom when my jacket hardly does the same for my waist, well so be it!
  

Gorgeous layering effect of two different white fabrics here! Have to think about Tokyo for some reason while watching these pics! 😉

I love it! My big struggle when it comes to lenths is finding a coat longer that my dress/skirt without looking like gothique chic.

Love the play on lengths Evangelie & how sleek the total look is. Most of all your hair looks AMAZING!
Happy Easter!
Hugs Adele xoxo

Well, the proportions are insanely good here… Of course, fashion should be about what you feel the most confident in, and God, do you look good in Balenciaga !

You can find the Balenciaga “Navy” line for Mykonos at Freeshop Mykonos.
In the blue we love!
So what’s up guys? Long time no see. I KNOW, it’s terribly annoying but on the other hand I’m sure that you are happy for me, especially when I combine work with vacation, a match made in heaven if I may. I presume you do follow me on Instagram (now that I’ve taken the big decision un-private my account) and witnessed, except from the Aegean Sea’s crystal clear waters also the launch of a bag we are pretty proud of: Balenciaga’s “Navy” line in the most summery makeover.

So on the 17th of July I flew over to Mykonos to host this very special event for Balenciaga, the cut of the ribbon of the most vacation-ready bag of the year: The “Navy” collection of canvas handbags, crafted from a beige cotton and linen-blend with the Myconian blue for the featured leather’s trims and details. That evening was beautiful, island vibes and the perfect same-color cocktails were designed for a crowd that already did say yes, YES(and cheers) to Mykonos and it’s very own bag.

The three sizes of “Navy” you can find at Freeshop Mykonos. Enjoy!

I’m back…sparkling gold leaning against the marble walls Au Palais de Tokyo just after Acne’s F/W show. This is a-just-dropped-by-to-say-hello post, first folks I have to hydrate and seriously vitamin-ate myself to be able to spell the Parisian beans. So HELLO! I have missed you!


you are gorgeous!

I saw your street style photos with Nicole Warne!  Fashion is such a tiring business! 😉

Where have you seen them Serena? xoxoxo

I saw them on a few street style photogs’ site via links from WhoWhatWear.  At least 2 or 3 sites I can’t remember (they weren’t my daiy visit and not being bookmarked).  All on the day you and Nicole having the “animal” moment in Paris.  🙂  It must be weird facing so many camera lenses outside of shows because you would not know who’d post on what sites.  I bet they don’t always ask you for a card and/or give you a business card.

Amazing blazer!!

Makeup & hair Stellar

I’m extremely proud to present to you my first capsule collection, I’ve designed for Tom Wood, the originally jewlery mega-brand which is now expanding to the clothing industry. My favorite Scandis will make their market debut with two lines: The namesake one, a men and women minimalistic collection and the Heroine by Tom Wood, 10 cleaned lined pieces that were always on the top of my wish list. 10 pieces that could be worn in multiple ways yet all destined to make us all feel comfortably confident.

So how have they all started…Well in May 2012 Mona Jensen, Tom Wood’s owner and creative director contacted me to design a jewelry line for her then soon-to-be launched brand. I felt really honored but not yet ready to design jewelry. However with clothes was another story. It’s something that probably in my genes. From age zero, it felt natural to design outfits. I had even created my own mini-line when I was in high school with a local seamstress. It was good I’m telling you, at least I had totally enjoyed it. So when we hooked up again with TW team during the last NY fashion week, as we were discussing of how much our fashion aesthetics do match up, they popped up the question to me: design my first capsule collection. As far as I remember it didn’t need that much time to decide. I was already a big fan of Tom Wood’s signet lines and the proposal was dreamy. Not  to co-design or just put my name on a label. To put my whole soul, the whole me. And I’m really so thankful for that. So thankful that Mona believed in me and trusted that we both, together, we could make a miracle happen. So here it is, the Heroine by Tom Wood, a collection of pieces that ALL have a story behind, stories that I will reveal one by one in the near future.

 

perfect, I want them all, please more photos!

Awesome collection!
You did an amazing job.

 Celine coat/ Maison Martin Margiela boots/Apriati rings

Ph: Sara for Département Féminin 

My favorite Toulousians are back, in another French city, the mother of the cities, à Paris. This time, we’ve joined forces with my Parisian lover Charlotte to celebrate the fashion week with a photo shoot for Département Féminin at Place Vendôm, one of the most beautiful squares dans la magnifique ville, you see my Frenchies are back and strong!


On another (unfortunate) note, yesterday I’ve had an accident with my car’s door, that sadly required 8 stitches between my brow and my eye. An embroidered eye practically means vision sans fun, yet the my owe-ed x-rays will be back…soon…and I will find you…I promise you. 


Au revoir…

Get well soon! You look amazing here thought 🙂 <3

Get well soon. You look amazing!

Hey Nalini,

Stella McCartney dress/Vintage Prada jacket/Tom Wood ring.
This is my second time attending the Haute Couture fashion week in Paris and honestly well worth my weirdest still-existing jet lag. Auto-recharge is always available as soon as my rubber soles touch down the facred* Paris-land. To begin, Haute Couture is not only a treat for the eyes. It’s a treat for the senses. A couple of months ago, when in Dior’s atelier I’ve had the chance to switch my usual black leather attire for a green sapphire gown. It was a  heavy-silk strapless dress. NO sparkles, no bids, no embroidery not any other impressive vision attractor. Just a simple floor-sweeping gown. However as soon as I secured the final hook of it’s geniously hidden internal corset I’ve realized that Raf Simons is definitely one of the greatest Couturiers alive. His magic stick, or his exquisite tailoring  if you’d like, had turned a structured silhouette to an extension of me. The very best of me. That dress was like flowing from my soul and If there was one moment in my life that I’ve felt like a Queen, well that was that. We all need an extraterrestrial experience once in a life time, no? Anyway what I’m trying to say in not-so simple words is that Haute Couture yes comes to impress but above all is a testament to the artful skills of a brilliant maker.

Now, the Spring 14 Dior show was a geometric/organic(if you think the extensive use of flowers) wonder. When I first approached the entrance at the Rodin Museum I was completely stunned. The building was covered by huge mirrored panels which were reflecting the great architectural heritage of the aforementioned museum. A blending of old and new, fanciful and realistic. Once inside it was pretty obvious. Simons and his audience, us, were going to time-travel. Two massive white, coming-from-our-very-distant-future-extra-stylish-mothership, corridors were ready to welcome their heroines. The collection itself was a vast collection of achievements. Artistry and craftmanship. But this time folks, the picture can partially speak because let’s face it, this is Haute Couture…a garden of senses….

 

 

*Hybrid: fashion-sacred



Stunning pictures! A very interesting collection of geometric forms, cutouts and transparent materials.
In particular I love your outfit you wore at the show! This dress is amazing!

All the images belong to By Malene Birger’s Pre-Fall 16  global digital campaign 

Tadaaaaa, your girl, your very best friend from 2011 is the proud face of the newly released digital campaign of By Malene Birger. It’s not my first campaign however this one will be forever treasured in my heart as it’s the first one also produced by us as a creative studio. Yes the depicted images have been shot solely under our Greek sun.  A series of images inspired by By Malene Birger’s calm power. Simple lines, soft light and colors for the woman who radiates confidence and security in her BMB pieces. And that was exactly my direction behind the campaign, true feelings, for true clothes. I hope you like it.

 Stella McCartney dress, size 40(check out the shorts, good no?)/Maison Martin Margiela boots, true to size(here and here)/Tom Wood rings.

Ph Jordan Makarof

Here I am, like another royal blooded in secret, gracefully getting down my castle’s stairs, to finally declare my unconditional love for….. those boots! The thigh-high(est). Majest-est! By the way I’ve just remembered someone, under a street style feature on Harpers Bazaar with my other Parisian snake-skin Stella McCartney dress, mentioning that their bohemian nature didn’t flatter my dress. Well I guess that Margiela would not be very thankful that he is expanding in another, until now unknown to him, market, the hippie-chic may I say?! Beware Isabel Marant..

Will you still love me when I’m no longer beautiful….taste a little Gatsby just because….of THOSE stairs.

 

You look great with anything you put on!
By the way,I am in doubt for quite some time know,whether or not to invest in a Celine Box Bag,or not?As I see a bag as an investment:-))I would like your expert opinion to help me decide,what small bag should I go for,like a cool alternativ for my 2.55?I am in to fashion,but you know better the next big think:-)Much better.What would you by,cool and classic?Thank you!

Awww thank you Dana.
I would go gor the Chanel for an investment. Maybe a boybag?!

Peter Jensen jumpsuit/ Louis Vuitton belt pouch/Chloe mules(here and here)/Linda Farrow sunglasses.

Ph Timur Emek

And I really wonder, are we, the sassy Greeks, the only ones in the planet who shamelessly pronounce the belt pouches as BANANAS?! I hope not, so you my preciosas, to be able to link somehow the tittle with the image without speculating that after Milan I just went BANANAS. Either way, my magic foggy sphere mysteriously predicts that the aforementioned outfit divider(obviously that’s the cause the depicted belt serves) will be a huge trend. The “look mum no hands” expression in a completely different demonstration. No bicycle needed.

Back in Milan’s steamy streets just an hour before the Stella McCartney Spring15 presentation, dressed in the most comfort way, a jumpsuit that is. This Italian city doesn’t come easy with summer. That translates into heat and mosquitoes, a terribly nasty combination for sweetblooded girls like me. I did saved my hands though from a dot-ed disaster yet that did not applied on my legs. I still have the marks of Milan on my limbs but I also have another ones, those forever kept in my brain cells. Memories…

The Stella McCartney Spring15 presentation took place at “Orto Botanico” the botanic gardens, as the name implies, by the side of Bvlgary hotel. From a distance, the dramatic entry with Stella’s flowered-pink letters, the long fenced lush plants complex and the scattered candle lights made me think of a countryside party. But once I stepped through the last bushes the true “spirit” of the evening showed up. McCartney’s models impeccably dressed with the designer’s spring 15 collection, cheerfully interacting with the crowd. I seriously love this new coolness of presenting collections. It’s like a refuge from the metal glare of the cities. Some precious moments, quality if you may, to indulge into the fresh collection. The outfits themselves were absolutely beautiful. McCartney’s heroines, superheroes was actually this season’s theme, were strong yet fragile. Feminin yet a bit boyish. But above all they were happy, happy girls in their clothes’ absolute comfort. As we all should be.

Let my paparazzi skills speak for themselves.



 

ah those mules are just perfection <3

My sunglasses are Silhouette.

Ph Jeff Thibodeauco

/First there was the tuxedo suit, then Saint Laurent introduced us to the tuxedo jumpsuit and now we shake hands with the smoking hot Scandis and their tuxedo DRESS. All hail probably the most masculine dress you’ll ever witness which with a surprisingly twist of luck, if removing the shirt could ever mean that, would be the sexiest deep plunge dress on earth. Yes guilty I am, I also wore it like this and god is my witness guys I could see my belly button before I’ve been fatally taped. Fatally because that night there was a whole new meaning to the until recently romantic “really inseparable”. I’ve been mummified with double-faced tapes in order not-to-free-my-nipples to the crowd.

-Why dear, aren’t you enough brave? WHAT KINDA HEROINE ARE YOU?

Well I was in Dallas celebrating the exclusive launch of Mary Katranzou x MatchesFASHION.COM  and apparently I did want to enjoy sporting the beautiful bags than constantly covering my lemons….If only I had remembered to pack my bandeau top….next time…

-Of course we remember…you’ve literally brain-washed us with your ruthless hashtacking*.
Well… voilà, as a genuine French girl would say, the first pics of the editorial I’ve also styled for Departement Feminin in Toulouse, wearing major players like Balenciaga, Rick Owens, Celine, Valentino among others, are here!!! There are surely more to come but with your previous misbehavior I have to punish you…:) and wait-a-bit.

Earth calling!!!!!
Yes, she’s alive!!!!!
After a series of misfortunes during my first day in Paris(my Iphone was stolen at Galleries Lafayette), Paris Haute Couture evolved as it’s suppose to be, magnificence in grandeur. Because where else do you get THAT glamour except Paris HC week?
Caught just before(and after) the magical Elie Saab show, fully clad in my protection suit against the witchery Paris rain, seeking the answer to: Does the French capital have a tropical rainforest climate? Monsoons hit the city and it hadn’t stop raining cats and dogs.
On another note the Elie Saab show itself was gorgeous. Under a sky of luminous chandeliers, voluminous silhouettes of exquisite craftmanship. Pearls and amazing chiffons to turn every frog to a….modern beautiful princess :).

You can see my report from Paris here.

You’re an inspiration

Altuzarra coat(via Luisa World)(in navy and also in black)/Uniqlo denim pants/Celine booties(check out these red heels too)/Celine bag(via Luisa World)

Ph Haris Farsarakis

If a Greek had told you a couple of years ago that the spring coats, did actually exist, then either he has been confused or almost lying. In our sunny part of the Mediterranean coast we’ve had just three seasons: Winter, almost summer and summer. During the freakin-cold days you couldn’t actually survive without your duvet thrown over your shoulders. The rest of the months all you needed was your tanning lotion, a hat, a white t-shirt and during the breeziest days a cardigan. Lately though, due the climate changes, spring has been our newly found (and very precious) season. A season  that almost turns our faces emoji-blue during the brisk nights. Nowadays we need the spring coats people. We, the formerly tank-brave ones, admit it. It’s not that bad though. Because if you ask me I kinda prefer them over the chunky winter ones. They are so oh-much  chicer as my Nick would say. I’m starting to getting used to the half-year-cover-up idea and to be honest yes, I like almost it.

I’ve always been a fan of straw bags, ever since I used to take my grandmother’s picnic bags to accessories to rediscovering them a couple of years back. This season I’m love with Rosie Assoulin’s interpretation of the straw bag and how, even just its shape, takes me back to Greece and leaves me feeling all warm and nostalgic inside.

Bangkok is one of my favourite cities - its raw energy is like nothing else in the world. I try to come here at least once a year to clear my head, which is funny given the chaotic and hectic pace of the city. The temperature acts like a yo-yo and it’s always humid so I tend to wear short skirts, loose-fitting trousers and sweatshirts here. I’m in love with this new jersey top from a stellar Russian brand called Walk of Shame. And it’s shamelessly cool, don’t you think?

As someone who has hyperpigmentation, I have to be really careful under the sun - especially in the tropics. I obsess with creams, sunblock and hats, and now I found a product that has been the most efficient to date. Chanel’s  SUBLIMAGE La Protection UV SPF 50 is both potent and delicate, which takes the best care of your skin so you can be carefree during your time off!

Seneca once said, if one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable and this is the reason why I love Phoebe Philo’s Céline so much. She has such an inspiring vision and clear direction, noticeable in everything from trend-setting silhouettes to chic details. Check out the placement of the zippers on these Pre Fall 17 boots. To die for!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Here we are almost in the middle of summer, heat-wav-ed, yet constantly dreaming of the upcoming winter collections. In the past, I wondered why the designing houses do show that early before the actual collections hit the stores and cause to us long and uncontrollable cravings. But only recently, after I’ve  found a vitamin-elixir(similar to Asterix’s) which actually over-fed my very thirsty brain cells(I’ll talk about this in a future post) the answer became pretty obvious: Nothing is ready, EXCEPT THE SHOWPIECES, the designing houses need to take the numbers from the buyers and these numbers finalize their production’s process. The biggest the demand, the hardest the factories will work to supply.

Back to the model-march typhoon, that is up, down, everywhere on this post. I must have spent more than three days to see the whole designing-universe folks, a kinda answer to all of you who keep asking me why I haven’t continued designing another collection.  There is everything out there guys, everything that I’ve ever dreamed of and even more, is already strutting down the catwalks. Why should I keep designing?!

So  today, I have selected, according  to my own taste solely, the very best pieces straight from the Winter 15/16 collections. Selected all with care, one by one, the looks that are actually all in my massive wish-list. My real inspiration. Because, between you and me, catwalks do inspire me most of anything….

Enjoy!

 



Gucci my fave!

Bottom pic: Etoile Isabel Marant dress(and black), size small. ph Jordan Makarof – Share please DO! -What…what? I don’t eat anything! -Is it a wig, girl? Spill the beans! Oh, now I see…No (ala Marc Jacob’s winter fashion show) wig, neither a “hair growth’ success story. The Nobel prize can still wait. My bangs are concealed. Vanished under massive piles of hair for the needs of this morning’s photo shoot for StyleBy. The absolutely awesome Swedish fashion magazine is celebrating three whole years of success and they have teamed up with me and Jordan for some very celebrational clicks. The depicted me are from backstage stills and it’s not the editorial’s outfit.I’m not the one who’s gonna spoil the surprise. For this you havejust  to wait StyleBy #24, out on late March. So about the bangs….have I reached a turning point? Hmmmm….time will show! 

love the shots and this look.
those boots are amazing

Love your looks!

Ph Jordan Makarof

The aforementioned sweatshirt on another adventure, strategically chosen to cover up my precious assets. On the bottom line(literally) It’s hard to get the perfect length-ed top. No?

Really enjoy your blog, always editorial but also real. Would you mind sharing what size the sweater is?

Hi Adriana,
I got it in large.
xoxo

Well, the point of view depends on the point of the seat 😀 With my 5’2″ it’s not that difficult, honestly, sometimes it’s pain in the ass that everything is sooo long. But beyond that you are absolutely right! Sometimes even when the length is good, the shape sucks.

That being said, the sweatshirt is perfect and it’s really great idea to wear it with feminine lace skirt.

totally true! The shape is so hard to find. Btw have you see the Acne fall sweatshirts?
Gorggggg

Yesss and I fell in love with them! Acne never disappoints 🙂

Did you know that Toblerone mountain actually exists? Before you rush to the conclusion that I might want to judge your knowledge skills, I will step forward to admit that I, personally, didn’t know it at all! Yeah I always sucked on Geography yet I loved any kind of chocolate, I still do (and to be completely real-time-sync with you, at the moment I’m actually chewing one piece of gianduja) so when I faced the depicted universal temple of cravings and absolute beauty last week in Zermatt, Switzerland, was one of these days, that made me believe that if the Toblerone mountain is real then somewhere somehow Willy Wonka is still waiting for me, to test my self-control next to his hot chocolate river. Enough with my non-stop cravings and let’s go back to Zermatt, this beautiful village right in the heart of the Swiss Alps where I’ve had the honor to participate alongside with another 7 bloggers in a dreamy photo shoot for Jimmy Choo’s newest collection, the Moonlight. The above stills are from day one, when I wore this lethal perfection for the uber photographer Candice Lake, whom I’m a big big fan, dressed in a pale yellowish silk robe, lying on a bed. What? You can’t wait to see the results? Me too!

Loved it all – Jenny @seasonsincolour

Hmm. So far I considered myself as an excellent expert on geography. Now I have to rethink that… Anyway, beautiful location and really amazing photoshoot. You and Haris did awesome job again!

 Bottega Veneta jumpsuit, size 40( here and here)/Ann Demeulemeester boots, size down(similar here)/Prada vintage shearling(similar here)/Tom Wood rings.

Ph Jordan Makarof

When on a recent interview I’ve been asked who’s my style icon, it took me awhile to answer. People change, styles change, times change, we change. Nothing stays the same and inevitably it’s difficult to have a reference point in my sartorial behavior. However there’s just one thing that never changes. Memories. That exact day, I’ve got the depicted dream-made Bottega jumpsuit. It’s awesome, no? Anyway, that’s not the point but when  I’ve looked myself in the mirror all the memories came rushing back. There was no doubt of who should I blame for my insatiable appetite for all-in-ones,  tailored blazers and leather jackets. My mother guys. All my love for the simplest silhouettes and the androgynous dressing is due to her strongest genes and her never ending tutorials. I remember in the very distant past she was wearing a winter white jumpsuit when others thought that it was some alien invasion’s forgotten leftovers. She really had the finger on the pulse of the fashion scene folks. Still no one but my mom can pull off so good a coat with a color combo that resembles prison stripes. No one. And I say still because she’s been through a lot, she’s a cancer survivor and her body(and way of thinking) has drastically changed yet she never gave up her love for fashion. She remains one of the chicest women I know and the fashion icon in my book.

 

Such a very cool look!!! 

http://www.dutchfashiongirl.com

This jumpsuit is so beautiful. I could never pull it off but you look amazing in it. Love the boots pairing.

I love the look and the story even more – how wonderful – you mother sounds incredible

Dress Valentino(I adore this one)/Coat Valentino(check out this blue perfection)/Belt Louis Vuitton/Shoes Celine
First Pic Søren Jepsen
Second, third and fourth George Angelis

The show images by me.

Benjamin Button-ing the fashion week and that means starting from the last day ending to the first, your Parisian report kicks off with white. White dressing for the best fashion show per me(even though I shouldn’t openly take a stand), Valentino’s winter collection showing left its audience with a smile on the face. Exit poll gone fab and happily curved mouths on their way out of the Tuileries’ tent.  And the surprise that nobody knew… Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson took over the final walk of the show, sending the audience, including me, into a frenzy. And thank god my reflexes worked fast enough to shoot video of “Hansel’ fiercest than ever. But if you ask me that wasn’t the highlight of the show. The highlight has been its own protagonists, Maria Grazia and Pierpaolo’s winter nymphs. There are no words to describe the beauty of Valentino’s new collection and certainly there are no words to describe the admiration I feel for the aforementioned designing duo, who worked so hard for the past four months to produce two Haute Couture collections and two R-T-W. Is it humanly possible? Well, not only it is but it’s a bright example that people can overcome themselves and produce little miracles. The collection itself has been absolutely poetic. Floating transparencies, mosaic patterns and Victorian silhouettes all blended in a very contemporary way. Wanna see the doted bow that has already stolen my heart? Of course you do!




Looking fab as usual!

Ph Jordan Makarof

Stop squeezing your belly button. Fashion dictates the pants that will automatically do that for you. I warn you thought. It’s nothing like the much-loved feeling of comfort of the old boyfriend pants. Nevertheless you’ll have legs for miles and your tiny waist will certainly be reclaimed. Let the tall-limb makers take us all high…

I always love photos from backstage, especially when they come out as an editorial;) good job!

 Celine Coat, size 36/ Acne leather pants, size 34/ Ann Demeulemeester sneakers(big to size).

Outfit photos Timur Emek

The rest by me.

19 days later, one year older, stitched and definitely wiser. No, no, cockiness is not my new trait, it’s actually old, and it’s cool, yes you’ve heard that from me, it’s cool to be a damn cocky peacock as long you are not rude. Because rudeness is a weak imitation of strength and, remember? We are heroines. Supergirls. Super-powered 🙂


Leaving the lessons behind, the depicted blanket-ed me was enjoying all the glory of the comfortable dressing during the fashion week’s most horrible storm. And if fashion weeks resemble to weddings, that means (very)high heels and flashy attires, I’ve decided instead opting for survival. That day it was not raining, it was storming! The Tuileries were transformed into a muddy mess of colorful ponds and the happy couple (Charlotte and I) was continuously trying to hope over them like another Kermit. The Elie Saab show was surely our shelter, or better our Oasis. The designer this year used my favorite color hues of emerald-green, burgundy and of course black for his creations, a certainly hard-to-resist collection for our next winter. This season also has marked something of a change for the designer. The bags. Opulent colored in clean geometric shapes with luxurious chain straps. The bags themselves looked absolutely fantastic. And due to the fact that I had the honor to be presented by Elie Saab with an emerald-green before the show, cross my heart guys, I swear, they also feel so, soooo damn good.


The pictures were taken after the storm show by Timur Emek, who is the living proof that talent and kind personality can really go well together.

PS. Thank you all for the wonderful birthday wishes! You’ve made me the happiest girl in the world and I loooove you!

amazing pictures, you look stunning!

*The greatest of all if I may.

It’s almost an urban legend the changing of weather conditions every single time I shoot with Jeff in NY. Either it’s snowing or raining but in the most severe way, that means storms or even a hell of a blizzard situation. After so many times we, both, have finally accepted that someone curses us. An evil witch in disguise! ….However, we try, against all odds to make the most fun of it.

Bip bip bip…Evangelie is shooting, NY is going on lockdown…#severeweatherwarning
So here I am, braving a NY monsoon in order to demonstrate to the universe that If an outfit is great, even when it’s completely soaked, it still look absolutely awesome.
The thing that I’ve realised lately, is that it doesn’t necessarily mean that only a good design makes a great staple. The material must be also greater. There are poplins and poplins, denim and denim, wool and wool out there. Lemaire has succeeded to marry both of the aforementioned ingredients to make the essentials-recipe, 3 star Michelin worthy. Honestly It’s only until you wear his shirts to understand that they are really something else. The softest touch of their cotton feels like the most precious silk. Nope, I am not drunk, it’s just that my first encounter with the Essentials’ king was simply unforgettable. You have to see and most importantly try all of his simple-lined pieces and you’ll also conclude that investing on awesome staples is the most genius gift you can offer to yourselves.

ps: This is not an advertorial post!

Ronald van der Kemp blouse|
 Ronald van der Kemp pants

Photography Haris Farsarakis

Emerging designers, or else the holly grail I’ve got to find. Oh yes I remember well the last time I’ve mentioned one on this space. It’s been Demna Gvasalia and Vetements, impressed at that point of time my newly acquired sweatshirt. Blonde…you had almost forgotten this right? I haven’t…I still remember how good it felt because YAS blondes do have much more fun.

Back to the serious talking… Ronald Van Der Kemp has been set my heart on fire. The man not only introduced the “demi-couture” to me with the incredible craftsmanship of his line, imagine that the RDVK pieces are sewn by hand but also reminded me again that extraordinary fashion has to do with extraordinary feelings. A line that takes you back to the romantic past, when the fashion houses actually cared about making you feel unique and not just a number in the vast mass with their impeccable tailoring and unique sewing. Take for example this marinière, looks familiarly fab but with a closer look you realize that it’s uncommonly fab as a mesh serves for the base of the silk panels to be carefully hand-stitched and not only cover your tities but also fit like a precious glove. Past techniques will light up the future of fashion and Ronald definitely knows this.

So pretty! Love this outfit

Color quizzes and color trivia. In continue to my inability to set a description for complicated colors, I call the entire universe, not to judge me, but to help me… What is that? Is it like a dead vintage salmon? Old powder? Dirty nude? How would you describe the color for the depicted clutch? Let the fashion-brains conference to declare a verdict and I am ready to accept it. Nevertheless, after (my soft spot) burgundy, it makes a hell of contrast/match with black…No?

 Vintage Prada Jacket/Stella McCartney Dress size 38(here and here)/Maison Martin Margiela Boots(here and here)true to size/RayBan sunglasses

Photography: Carin Olsson/parisinfourmonths.com

 

The curtains have officially rung down on the OMG factor of fashion, the Haute (of Hautest) Couture week and I’m back from Pariland with a surprisingly not-so-exhausted mood to tell about the revamped fairytale that can never go bad. Haute Couture week is a perfectly organized celebration of the wonders. The wonders of fashion, the masterpieces of art. Not-so-much to my own surprise (it’s the second time that I’m attending the HC week) at this point of time Paris is the capital of peace and totally enjoyable. Not any chaos outside of the shows or any unreasonable hysteria, no human-lines in front of the boutiques, not a week booking in advance for your favorite restaurant at the very least. Pareeee was a pure seduction. The snugggled-in-my-shearling depicted me was shot by the brilliant Carin Olsson who I met again, last time was during the (literally)steamy NYFW) at the seats of the Dior Enterprise or the futuristic corridors of a super stylish future.  More on that will follow shortly but first I have to answer to all of you who I briefly encountered on my previous post. I’m back people!

I love your shearling jacket. It’s difficult to find a statement coat that’s warm. Isn’t Carin fabulous? She takes the most beautiful photos.

I am head over heels for that jacket.

this jacket, if you did not say vintage, I’d have never guessed!  Great design is long lasting.  🙂

Love what you said about PFW and the city in late January.  Imagine how many people worked their bxtt off to produce and present the shows!  Attendees are the luckiest people, pure fantasy and enjoyment.

The dress is to die for!

FAB!

Oh those boots… I’ve been dreaming about them almost 2 years now… This is the only mid-height boot I have found (remember me telling you how difficult it is to find one???) but unfortunately it is “a bit” over my budget… dammit %^%@#^&&^%&…
The print of the dress is also something new to dream about…

Meawwwww…Isn’t what the sassy kittens do? Looking through their lashes, trying inwardly to be a full-time heart-melter?! You see I seriously want to get in DAT role!

-What role? Girl you’re getting weirder and weirder….

-Weirder the better!

To pull off that micro mini thing! That’s the role. And I’m telling you, It’s a protagonistic one.

So that’s honestly the shortest you can ever get from me. Not that I can’t be more revealing, I can’t, but there isn’t any more Lilliputian than that. We have reached the limits. Red alert.

Yes Mr Rousteing, you are such a firemaker!

Flawless! xo

The shooting took place at Grande Bretagne Hotel

 

On October 21, an astrologically great date if you ask me, there was a fresh, bloomy air on Gucci.com. The site of my personal – literally endless – wishlist has been revamped and relaunched to become a new and inspiring online space. The brilliant imagery onsite really helps convey Alessandro Michele’s creative vision for his collections, a world “full of beauty”. Since Michele was appointed as the new creative director of Gucci earlier this year, I’ve so eagerly desired to visually convey all of my feelings about his creations, which have not only revived the legendary house but also the whole fashion community.

This editorial is a celebration of the new gucci.com and a chance to show you all that for me, Alessandro Michele is not only a brilliant designer, he is also a magician. He can put stitches in time. In Gucci’s parallel universe, old and new, future and past simply don’t matter. It’s all about emotions, individuality and a sensible confusion that hovers somewhere between dreams and reality. And there, exactly at this state of mind I invite you all to join me….Enjoy!

I am in love with the flair, movement, and drama of these photos. Beautiful work!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I’m a huge comment sucker. And I read every single of them. And I mean it. But how about to take this platonic relationship a step further? Are you ready?

-Hmmm…now you’re creeping us out!

Well I certainly don’t mean to sail from kinda-dating to married-with -kids. No that can’t happen. I’m already married. You? That’s exactly the point: To know more things about you. What’s your stories or at worst..what’s upppp? What did you eat last night, do you have a boyfriend, how’s your grandma doing…I can take anything… In our relationship please don’t let me be  the only great talker.

I hope you won’t jump the ship now….

hope to meet you one day!

Hey dear, are your IM pumps comfortable? 🙂 Still cant decide should I order them or wait and try! They are gorgeous! 

p.s. I recommended you as an great inspiration couple months ago! 🙂
http://fashionandstylev.blogspot.com/2013/08/get-inspired.html

For pumps, yes they are!!!
xoxo

I think you’re actually the only blogger who sticks with her own style.
I find your outfits so chique and Parisian!

marlsz.blogspot.com

Yesterday I saw you and Charlotte at Paris Fashion Week and I was flabbergasted. I didn’t know your blog before, so it tooks hours to find you! So glad and happy. You are perfect.

http://www.fashion-hooked.blogspot.com

Hi Mariska!
You should have talked to us…next time 😉
Thank you!

Your pictures are so goood!

Wow, your invisible readers surfaced in drove!  It’s so wonderful to read about them and about you.  🙂  You had your own business for years, no wonder there’s something very disciplined and solid about you (hard to hide essence in front of a camera lens).

Great to know that you are married.  It’s comforting to have someone close at home, in real life.  Sincerely wishing you and your beloved a team thru thick and thin supporting one another.

Well, me; almost 50, single (not dating either), no child, one cat, an office drone and a future pensioner (public sector, the only employer that provides retirees a pension now a day), living in an ultra hip area of LA, Chinese (from Taiwan), been living in USA 35+ years.

And you; perfect balance between photos and text, neither is too much or too long, a perfect escape into the land of couture fashion and witty writing.  There’s always something to learn from your styles, not just eye candy.

You’ve got a distinct style and voice, not interchangeable with other fashion bloggers (there are too many look-alike bloggers out there).  If I was a gambler, my money is on you to go far and grand.

33xoxo

PS.  I’ve never seen ripped jeans so artful and memorable.

PPS. Jordan is very good for you.  He’s helping you to develop your “voice”.

Yes isn’t it? Honestly I think it was the best idea I ever had during my cyberyears. It’s somekind of bonding to me.
Thank you for letting me know a bit better. I was very interested about you 🙂
So you are a cat person..I had a cat in the past…but she liked to continiously escape so once I lost her. I wish I knew you last year I was in LA. We could definitely have a live chat. Do you visit often Taiwan? Would you suggest it for me to go there for vacations?
Thank you for your feedback all this time, i really love your comments.
xoxoxo

A brilliant idea indeed!  Thank you for taking the time to reply to all who shared.  It really goes both ways.  🙂

I wish I’d visit taiwan more often (last time was 2010, after 20 years of no visit).  I am planning another 2-week trip this November to see my 85-year-old auntie again.  

Regardless if you’ve visited China or not before, I’d recommend Taiwan.  It’s small but not small.  It’s a blend of old and new.  Food is amazing with better quality (less fake ingredients compare to China) and better price (compare to Japan and Korea).  It’s cleaner than Thailand but not sterile like Singarpore, and MUCH SAFER than india.  People are well mannered and friendly towards travelers.  

If you visit both Taiwan and China, you will notice the difference between the two.  The same chinese people and culture but China is neauvo riche.  Too much money too fast and Cultural Revolution in the 70’s rub off a lot of class and heritage.  Let me recommend a travel writer’s web site.  He wrote about his experience visiting Taiwan in many of his blog entries.  http://landlopers.com/?s=Taiwan

Do check out the rest of his blog, too.  I love his travel writing and photos.

Saint Laurent shirt/Roland Mouret leather leggings/Fratelli Rossetti shoes.

Ph Sara Perringerard for Departement Feminin.

All black everything and me in the middle of a sci-fi scene at the “Les Abattoires” Museum or in simple English, Toulouse’s Modern and Contemporary Arts Museum. That night the exhibits on display, thank god, did not come to life… there were some pretty scary mummies on the upper floor. Joking guys. Yes the mummies did exist yet f I had to say something for that day, I’d say that I felt extremely honored that “Les Abattoires” had opened its gates for us, to shoot for Departement Feminin. It was Monday and the museum was as it should be in a day that is close to public. Calm and quiet. When wandering through its world of corridors though, I could feel the chills from the impact of standing alone in front of the exhibits’ impeccable beauty. Chills that I’ve never felt before…. One of the times that you take a deep breath and be thankful for that enormous joy your job has given you.

I miss the days that you showcased more range in shade and color–all these all-black outfits are feel unimaginative and monotone!

These pics are true works of art !

It’s insane how everything you wear is ultimately perfect !

Love everything, and especially those fabulous leather pants !

What really makes an IT bag? When it stands out from a cactus pear overpopulation then here you have IT.
I’m joking guys however if my instincts still work well what remains solid true from the previous sentence is that the J.W.Anderson Pierce bag will indeed be the newest universal LOVE. On 19th May MATCHESFASHION.COM exclusively launched this bag as part of its Digital Trunk Show hub and gave the chance to some of lucky ones to experience Anderson’s awesome piercing first, before the rest of the world. Let me say this, the bag itself is the coolest brown bag I’ve seen lately and almost the coolest pierced person (yes you’ve heard well I treat my bags humanely, we also have dialogue some times) I’ve met this year. And cool beings shall always stay in our lives. Even under an avalanche of cactuses.

Absolutely stunning pictures!

Ph Jeff Thibodeau

Looking my reflection in the windows underneath the shadows of NY’s skylines, I’ve almost thought I were some kind of mysterious extraterrestrial creature. Long hands, fish net bag, slouchiest pants…Still sane yet crazier than ever. It wasn’t the first time I’ve been breaking the rules of fashion but I was definitely feeling better than ever. Vetements, a teamwork headed up by Demna Gvasalia, are the cool kids’  latest favorites and the ones to watch. And if you argue that reconstruction of the basics is not a new idea I will answer that yes it’s not yet crossing the lines and still look good, awesome if I may, yes IT IS.

You can see an BOOM selection of Vetements here.

Original, muakes from Seville (Spain)!!.

It’s just that styleheroine.com has been experiencing some internal changes to become more user-friendly, changes that didn’t permit me, till now, to post. But here I am promising you that something awesome is coming up…just tomorrow. Be here.

Valentino and golden Goose sneakers ? It totally works, love this !

Leather jacket Saint Laurent/ Blazer Acne/Pants Acne/Boots Saint Laurent / I Am by Ileana Makri earring
Ph Carin Olsson

The shooting took place at Palais De Tokyo, right after Elie Saab‘s Haute Couture show.

A different color shade does change your life, not in every single way, that will only happen by moving to Honolulu. What needs urgently adjustments thought, is your wardrobe. For example golden accents previously banished, now are welcomed with open arms. However life with blonde is not so pink as it sounds. My favorite “all black everything” belongs to my not-so-long-ago past as it looks like a bad dominatrix-joke when matched with my yellow undertones. Who’s the boss now woman?

Hair is the boss…I should have known better…..


beautiful details of the jacket!

Sunglasses Cindy by Jimmy Choo/ Balenciaga shorts/ Balenciaga shirt(find them both in Balenciaga boutique Athens)/ Jimmy Choo Genoa flats.

Ph Haris Farsarakis

If for every given male character, there is a female version of that character, then I would totally be Elton John’s alter ego. Not that I have a great voice, on the contrary I actually sing like a donkey. The only thing in common though is that me and the legendary singer, we both love to collect sunglasses. Yeap, my make-up disaster saviours, my best hang-over cure (you know when your face looks like the Scream-mask and your biggest sunglass is your one and only chance to cover up your mess) have a prominent place in my wardrobe, in a hand-made storage box where small wooden rectangle cutout-shapes protect them during their naps. Lately my collection grew up with Cindy series and that’s nothing else but Jimmy Choo’s newest cat-eyes. I don’t know about you but I consider all of these feline shades the most flattering of all as they do give to our aura an alluring almost mysterious-sexy vibe. The five retro colours, the dove grey, gold copper, aqua, honey and (almost) red of Jimmy Choo’s Cindy collection, they bring a much wanted nostalgic fell back to our chicest days. And when you really think about it, cat-eyes are the most gracious of all sunglasses and if they couldn’t bring chic back, well nothing else could…..

You can find Jimmy Choo’s Cindy collection here.

My God, these pictures are brilliant. I love your style.
Check out mine if you’re curious.

I usually have super chapped lips so a little trick of mine is to apply a bit of lip balm before the lipstick. However, even since my lips have gotten acquainted with Coco Rouge, they have never felt more hydrated! This new lipstick by Chanel is both nurturing and packed with gorgeous pigment, my favourite being number 444 Gabrielle. Juicy cherry lips all Summer baby!

I wouldn’t call it being Big in Japan just yet, but being featured in Vogue Japan’s September issue is a BIG deal for me! The magazine has always stood for avant-gardism and fresh new takes on fashion, and for its September issue I got to show my favorite F/W17 pieces. In this particular photo I’m wearing look 55 from the Fall Winter 2017 Valentino show, a stunning silk gown that gives me the best beach bod wouldn’t you say?

You can tell Karla Colette has been designing most of her life - her understanding of the female form and how women want to feel in swimwear has made her the go-to beach brand for stylish women around the world. My favourite piece right now is the black velvet Victoria swimsuit - fit for a queen.

In repeat.

When I fall in love with a song why do I play it to death until I hate it? The same mysteriously happen with my bags, my shoes(in response to all these complains about my Demeulemeester boots) even my bras! Now you know the truth. I simply can’t help it. If more like me, do exist out there, please give a shout. I don’t really like to be alone. If not, well then a professional needed to efficiently handle my case.

Back to our friend from the past, the almighty Marant, her latest resort collection is certainly not any fresh start but definitely a good turn to some kind of evolution, don’t you think? RE-FRIEND!

 

 

stunning!

I do hear a song on repeat when I like it!same goes with bags and shoes…but I do like to rotate my clothes a lot!

Love the shoes!

Valentino playsuit


Anine Bing shirt/Valentino denim(via LuisaWorld)
Valentino blouse

Ph Haris Farsarakis
Summer keys, not summer kiss, destined for Florida Keys.

Are you confused? Ok, ok, enough with the shameless word playing. We are here in an attempt to demonstrate the summer’s essentials. The key pieces you need to pack with you, whether you go to and island or to a city.
Denim, lace, broderie anglaise.

That’s all you need guys, the no-time essentials which will accompany you all-vacation-around. I’ve really wanted to make this post for a long, long time because in the past I’ve always ended up with overstuffed luggage that made my dressing process chaotic. In simple words I could not decide what to wear. It’s like going to a shop that the clothes are hung from the racks like sardelles. Can you shop like that? Well I can’t. Same way with your luggage.

That, thank gawd, changed! Lately I’ve restrained my need to take all my house(and the neighbour’s) with me and I concentrate only on key items that will turn my vacation mode into a happily-ever-after mode.

Denim is effortless, broderie anglaise for poolside chic and lace to beautify the breezy nights. Do you need something more? I don’t!

[show_ms_widget id=”21698566″ image_id=”23040331″ width=”1300″ height=”716″]

Amazing !!
http://www.thefashionpanda.be

I love it all! Looks super cute together. I hate overpacking too. I usually never wear everything in there.

Top Isabel Marant(also in black), Shorts Isabel Marant,Hat Etro(at LuisaWorld)/Clutch Valentino

Ph Jordan Makarof

As I reminisce my past, brown (alongside yellow) was rather my most hated colour. Not even furniture close to that shade have been allowed to enter my house. However about a year ago, during a drooling excursion over Balenciaga shop, I came across with the aforementioned colour disguised in a jacket. The (until that day) blah factor hadn’t turned down my curiosity and in a what-the-heck moment I’ve tried it out. TA DAAA! That was it! All my past theories had fallen apart like a sandcastle. Brown did look well with my brunette head, in fact really well. I’ve misjudged! I’m guilty! Sue me! I don’t know if the fault is in my stubborn nature that it has been banned from my existence. In a matter of fact there must be also others than me out there, that’s why brown so hard to find, no?

Imagineeee, brown its a amzing color.Always think about this, all colors are betiful and my favorites.Xxx from Brazil.

Evangeline you look adorable

Kiss kiss.*Jo
http://joandcompanystyle.blogspot.com/

Just the most beautiful look!
We all have these colours we simply cannot abide, for me it’s purple, but again, yes, I am sure one day it will become desirable for me too…

Thankfifi

love this simply white outfit you are perfect on it for this summer xoxo

Like I’m reading my own story. Yellow and brown also always been my most hated colors (seeing them put together could literally burn my eyes or at least cause anaphylactic shock). Worse than looking like a huge walking canary or a jar of mustard can be only to look like… a poop. Because in my experience, that’s the thing about brown – it usually looks like a poop. And then I found out it’s (obviously) all about a shade. The perfect shade of brown may be the most beautiful way to highlight the beauty of brunettes and lightly tanned skin… But yeah, who cares about their beauty, let’s we all make it soo hard for them to find brown not looking like a poop. (so sorry I talk so much, I’m such freaking storyteller)

Your hat and the whole look is stunning, but Evangelie, you have really beautiful hair color! So deep and warm shade… and lighter ends look amazing:) It makes me want to darken my light brown..

You are an incredible story teller Izabel! Poop is the right word!ahahaha
Ah i am just a step from getting blonde. I think when I’ll be off to NY I’ll try it. I was once you know. But then too much maintenance and even more destruction. But now I’m ready to live with the mess again;)

By Malene Birger sweatshirt/Celine skirt and bag(at LuisaWorld)Chloe mules(here and here)/Linda Farrow sunglasses.

ph Jordan Makarof

Well it’s true. An unfortunate true. Key pieces are hard to find out there. Versatile pieces that can do miracles,that will easy balance out patterns, colours, statement mega-hits and “another stories”. Per me, the devoted to black supremacy girl, the depicted sweatshirt from By Malene Birger is my gal pal, twinsie, soul sista, in common language my ever favorite one. I wear it in very high rotation, on and on, until eventually will suddenly get melted….For a proof of my words there will be another post to follow….

 

The perfect combination for a chilly summer day…

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

It was weeks ago since I saw the Monique Lhuillier show in Paris but her S/S18 collection sure did leave an imprint. I think about her creations often when I have an occasion I need to get dressed for, her trademark hyper-feminine evening wear. Her last show was a treat of chiffon, ostrich feathers and lace in soft and delicate colors. There’s so much strength in standing your ground and showing fairy tale-inspired pieces in a current environment that seems to appreciate anything but.

Shocker! I went for the shoes again! Of course I’ll get to Zimmermann’s etherial, beautiful and sexy RTW pieces from Resort 18 too, but I just had to have these kitten-heel sandals first. I’m in love with them because they have the straps placed at all the right places and they have a walkable heel that makes them a dream to walk in, and a dream to look at.

Soho Farmhouse is a 100 acre members' club in Oxfordshire that brings together marvellous people from the creative fields and offers them an amazing experience in the English countryside. My stay at the farmhouse was as relaxing as it was exciting with its many facilities and outdoor activities such as horseback-riding and swimming. The only problem? Leaving it!

The Chanel Fall 17 Haute Couture show left me not only with memories from a beautiful collection, it also left behind a marvellous scent - the new Gabrielle Chanel perfume. With tones of orange blossom, jasmine, yilan yilang, tuberose and white flowers, it smells fresh and modern. If elegance were a fragrance it would be the new Gabrielle Chanel, and her words do still echo and inspire the Maison’s creations, "Elegance comes from being as beautiful inside and outside.”.

Elie Saab gown(similar here)/ Celine sandals(find them at LuisaWorld) similar here and here /Boucheron Jewellery
A million thank you to my most amazing hosts, the Elie Saab team for having me in this extraordinary journey.

The images are from the screening of the movie “The Assassin”

Where to start and where to end….If you are following my Instagram account you do already know that a couple of days ago I’ve been enjoying the light of Cannes invited by the red-carpet-designing-House-extraordinaire Elie Saab. If you don’t follow me well…you see what you’re missing?!

It’s been my first time in Cannes and honestly my whole experience exceeded every prior expectation. My hotel Martinez, is located straight in the heart of the Promenade de la Croisette, the vibrant and so crowded heart of Cannes.  You couldn’t approach the entrance of the hotel if you hadn’t pointed out to the security guys your room key as Martinez was the refugee of many celebrities and inevitably their massive following who had caused a daily traffic pandemonium around it. With some time management though that couldn’t be any trouble but appreciation for their sweet faces waiting under the sun for hours to see their beloved movie-heroes.

The first day has been majorly (well spent) in the Elie Saab showroom, a cinematic suite on the third floor of the hotel with sunning views of the windy French Riviera. Entering the room was like a BAM in the heart as the first thing you noticed has been an Elie Saab Haute Couture feather gown seducing you like the mediterranean Sirens. I’m telling you guys I hadn’t be able to think anything but the obsessing ‘Mine-Mine-MINE’ triple wording. All I wanted was to hug and squeeze and love this dress and actually all of its surrounding, the House’s whole Haute Couture collection that is. Breath control with some extra water and I was ready for my fitting. I’ve been obsessing over this lace dress for  a year or more so I’ve been literally ecstatic when I’ve realised that Elie Saab’s team had found it for me. Breezy, lightweight stripes of lace ending in an almost hybrid-athletic upper part. It was so perfect and unexpectedly it didn’t need any adjustments for my body so we proceeded to our dinner by the sea.

The next day, was the big one, my first ever steps on the Cannes’ Film Festival carpet, the red short line. And I’m saying ‘short’ because it’s definitely a smaller walk  than expected. HOWEVER I kinda get it because one thing’s for sure: You cannot run a marathon on heels. The way to the film screening should be short and effective, by effective I mean that I’ve never seen so many photographers in my entire life! I’m so surprised that I didn’t faint(I’m sure the Sambuka shot prior with my partners’ in crime Gala and Nathalie helped a bit). All went well, the actual existence of these pictures is the witness and happily ever reached the indoors of the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès.

To be continued….

You’re invited to see Cannes through my eyes below….enjoy!




WHAT TO WEAR:

Have fun and be yourself, the more individual and creative the better – embrace the mood and free style of Basel!
Colors, prints, stripes and florals even though I often end up in black!!!
Sneakers for walking around the Art Basel fairs and events all day and night as there is always a lot of ground to cover!
I take a backpack with me almost everywhere to carry my gear, make sure you check prior if you can bring your detachable lens camera
Sunglasses snd hats are a must – day into night to shade the potential lack of sleep under the bright lights
WHAT TO DO:

Pick the art fairs that are your life style ( https://www.thetaylorsauce.com/art-daze/ ) and pre-purchase tickets because the lines are long and you cannot cover them all!
Check out the open exhibitions in the hotels supporting Art Basel – there are often amazing hidden gems and you can walk through anytime
Spend the day taking in the murals and street art at Wynwood
Stroll around the Design District for great stores and unique interiors
Walk along South Beach as there are so many sculptures in public spaces such as Collins Park and the beach!

WHERE TO HANG:

The hotels always have awesome events and are great to just walk through with loads of art installations open to the public
At the fairs of course – I love Scope, Pulse, Untitled and Project
The Broken Shaker and 27 at the Freehand Hostel for fun vibes!
The Confidante Hotel has really fun events like Public School x Art Basel!
Poolside – my favorite way to relax and take it all in while in South Beach
WHERE TO EAT:

Le Sandwicherie – so so good for sandwiches and fresh juice on the go!
The Naked Taco for amazing healthy and fresh tacos!!!
Mandolin Aegean Bistro – I absolutely love Greek food and this place never disappoints not to mention that the courtyard is lunch perfection!
The Continental for a fun brunch scene, vintage vibes and photos
Casa Tua for a magical group dinner and how I like to close out Basel!
WHERE TO STAY:

Raleigh Hotel – old school art deco decor and vintage style
1 Hotel South Beach – beautiful decor and a great lobby meeting spot
SLS South Beach – lots of late night fun and lovely food at The Bazaar
Faena – cool new hotel and hosts amazing events during Basel too
W South Beach – escape from the world in this complex and importantly, amazing poolside bungalow suites with rooftop and plunge pool!

Great post dear!

Ph: Jordan Makarof

Between you and me, you knew that something was about to come…no? Could you imagine though,  that it would be the most amazingly exciting project ever? Yeap, life, even when Mercury is retrograde, is a beauty….

When  Harper’s Bazaar asked me to document my Paris Haute Couture looks for a super special diary, the answer was exactly the same as the one given to my marriage proposal: unconditional YES. I love  you but then…..who doesn’t?

Thus last week  Jordan, has travelled with me to the city of lights to capture my moments  just before the shows of the ever frantic PFW. Later Jordan had returned home with fever, I directly flew to the Canarys. I’m an extra tough cookie ;)….

The whole outfit diary is now live on Harper’s Bazaar.

 

Thank you Harpersbazaar.com. I’m super excited and beyond honored for our new collaboration.

And last but not least thank you Kerry Pieri. It’s been amazing working with you.

 

 

Incredible – congratulations!x

Thankfifi

The pictures AND outfits are stunning!

Love your dress
You look adorable

Ph Jordan Makarof

Fashion is indeed a damn clever lil brat whose brain-cells with just pure mathematics can produce real miracles. For example, using the old-school plus minus formula (plus volume, minus length), solved the how-to-have-giraffe’s-legs equation in a glimpse of an eye. In simple english try any of high-waisted boxy cropped pants and your limbs will totally resemble with Giselle’s. That easy, no spells, no chinese medicine needed….

All this look is so perfect, love love this colors

I had this discussion with my friend about confidence and she told me that she realized the more comfy she feels the more confident she is. WHOA. So many bells did ring with me…of so many lost years. At the time I was 19 years old and I’ve been continuously wearing pairs of sky scrapers. One day I’ve been walking really fast and didn’t pay attention to the public utilities grate thing on the ground and my heels got stuck. My body started to lean like the Pisa tower and then boom….it felt like a fell of a ladder.

Bruises:1 confidence:0
Yeap I’ve been hanging around with the tallest girlfriend clan, all volleyball players and I didn’t want to be the shortest of all…It took me some years and a lot of uncommon foot problems to understand that there are not friendly high-heels and confidence is not something that heights can give. On the contrary comfort feels good. And when you feel good it makes you confident and when you are confident you smile, chat, dance, have a blast, no matter your height. Simple mathematics.

I love this top shirt

I couldn’t agree more, now I’m all about the wearable heels and other cuts that I can actually breath in. Another great post.

This look is utter perfection! I love that it is so minimal and how you kept it casual with a great pair of dark washed jeans.  The mom jean style looks amazing on you, and this white top looks really good with the blue.  Plus, those flared sleeves are amazing! Perfect look

Chloe bazer, shorts and shoes(here and here, my current obsession)/Celine bag, check out this great alternative(available at Luisa World)/Linda Farrow sunglasses/Tom Wood signet.

Ph Jordan Makarof

Shorts with shirts, without, loose boxy jackets just to cover them or elegantly tucked in like the depicted one. So what your preferences say about you?

Let me guess…If you go for the version, jacket for top, you probably have no boobs like your sassy bestie….me! Unfortunately this staple piece of wardrobe wasn’t made to bare-worn and It is not soft enough to stay on put on curves, avoiding unwanted vulgarity. So I consider we are on the same boat under this much-revealing preference theory.

Then…if you tuck it in your shorts….hmmm, you are in need for dance! It’s the very stable version of the aforementioned saga for your happily ever after no-need-to-get-famous tatas! Let’s dance…common…….

Love the bag! It’s gorgeous

My second favorite saga, after GOT.

Funny, because until now I thought that I have too small boobs (actually don’t have them at all, but ok) to wear deep necklines and jackets as tops. But from now on I will bravely go in this direction! 🙂

You look absolutely perfect! I fell in love with your style and this outfit is my favorite *_*

Literally….because on the other side of the pond even the construction sites are photo shoot worthy….

Remember when in NY I went to Intermix-Meatpacking District to style and shoot their current collections? Well just before your eyebrows are floating, in my very minimal space layout, which btw I need urgently to change, the last of the images of our collaboration. Looking thoroughly at the pics though I really wonder how in the world did I stand on my own feet following a long, exhausting overseas flight and a douse with a bucket of cold water when my suitcase hadn’t ever arrived. Well Intermix must have some magical effect on me.

Nice shots. Cool outfits!

The images are outtakes from my shoot for Harper’s Bazaar Japan March issue.

To be completely honest, god, it was an incredible week. For sure the best one I’ve experienced as a blogger so far. At the begging of my New York journey I’ve gone strawberry blonde for US Harper’s Bazzar , thing that still gets me super excited every-time my new head pops-up in the mirror, after just two days I’ve been shot by Winnie Au for the feature on Harper’s Bazaar Japan’s March Issue (while working with  the sweetest, super fast and uber professional team) and finally I’ve experienced the ultimate beauty of Valentino‘s exclusive NY Haute Couture show, the real reason I’ve actually visited the Big Apple, an once-in-lifetime show, an all-white pure magic to celebrate the House’s new Fifth Avenue’s Flagship store, a collection, as I’ve already told you for so many times, I feel extremely grateful and honored that I’ve witnessed live, with all of my senses. These outtakes from my Harper’s Bazaar Japan shoot come to restore my euphoria levels to the point I feel I’m leaving the dream all over again….Ahhhhhh breath….

Rochas coat,size 40/Stella McCartney top, size 40/Stella McCartney pants, size 40/Celine lace-up, big to size(similar here).

ph Jordan Makarof

After triplette I and it’s sequel triplette II, a new chromatic orgy repeatedly hits my sartorial appetite. It’s no secret that lately all my body cells are seriously attracted to this pretty diversified trio. Ok black is black, you know me I’m a crow and white always plays the significant role of the peace maker during the darkest days but camel?

Let’s get personal, Alex, my husband, is the easiest person in the world towards my dressing. He  never complains and I never explain. BUT from the beginning of our relantionship there were two things banned: Lace and camel. Especially for the first one before we got married he had a very strange demand for my wedding dress:

-Wear whatever you want but please NOT a damn lace. I hate it!

Honestly I still cannot find the origins of that hatred. However for the second one he was totally revealing: During his school years a stinky camel had spat in his face. That was it! After that anything reminds the poor animals causes Armageddon.

-Honey, camels do spit(wikipedia-checked), please don’t take it personal.  She probably doesn’t even remember you by now. And mine….well she’ll certainly behave. Isn’t she a beauty?


 

Love this long jacket reminds me of a pendleton coat I just bought. Great for winter layering.

Tired as you might be from the frequent glorifications of your penultimate editorial existence, I’m here to celebrate the photographic grandeur of this post and your “femasculine” silhouette as one of pure awesomeness. Kudos Evangelie, you supreme being!

Love the coat!

I hadn’t realized how much you’ve missing my pen-writing till now. Thank you all so much for the heartfelt emails. The truth is that I always prefer to talk via images, they have so much to tell by their own and I considered my writing poor compared to the strength of a picture however since you’ve been continuously asking for my come back that simultaneously means that I must be doing something good…
 So back to back to my….back and my surprise hair-bow. To be honest the shirt, it’s actually one of the best blouses I’ve even worn, helped by itself for the depicted most fresh hair-do as it’s neck ties begin back in the middle of the collar instead of the front per usual.  I tied both of the ties in a generous bow as they are super long and…voila! Isn’t it cool? Plus no strings attached around neck, well  you know what it means right? Free movements and endless hair flips. And If you are really my girls…you like this.

beautiful shirt!

Valentino jacket/Levis denim/Valentino bag
Ph Haris Farsarakis
Ever since I got these Levis back in NY, I’ve really wanted to write a novel about the truth and lies of purchasing a vintage denim. You know, all the stuff no one says. Here’s one to start you off: You CANNOT buy them online. Don’t even dare. Vintage Levis buying resembles to treasure hunting. None is similar and it’s incredible hard to find the right fit. I must have tried on 20 pairs of jeans that yes, they did “fit” but didn’t flatter. As for the rest of them, they we just too shaggy. Vintage clothing have defects and the effect of defects on their value is completely opposite to the common logic. The more shredded, torn, bleached etc the more freakin expensive they are. And yes, here we go to our next point, real vintage Levis are so costly. Their price-range starts from 250$ to 500$. Quite an investment if you think that It’s actually used clothing. Last but not least after two hours of wearing them your pipi hearts. The pursuit of cheekiness has its own costs so don’t be surprised if an unexpected and kinda unpleasant feeling hits your lower part of your body in the middle of a gossiping/tea session with your girlfriends.

great info! Thanks for sharing!!

Second one-piece Matthew Williamson X the Outnet
Photography Haris Farsarakis

Creative direction and styling Evangelie Smyrniotaki

Beach ready-essential tips to avoid depression risk… That could be an alternative title of the editorial however I prefer to jump into the main point and simply depict both of THE tips in every single image: Choose a swimwear with great fit and flattering patterns. It would be impossible to share just one piece from the most fresh collaboration between The Outnet and the British fashion designer Matthew Williamson, the man who knows best colors and patterns. Let’s be honest guys, it’s so tough to find a great suit, utterly hatefully. The good news is that the Matthew Williamson x The Outnet ones have the best structure thus they will make you look as good as you can. And because I know that there is trust between us, I reassure you that The-girl-on-the-Coppertone-ad-days belong to the past as long as collaborations like these do happen….LOVE, love everything!
 

these swimsuit are so cute, but why is imposible to see this kind of swimsuit on the beach?

Ph Timur Emek

As previously refered, all aid to the most-wanted freedom of our….hands. First the banana and now the bucket bag. So what’s the hype with the bucket bags lately? Well except from the fact that they are back on the road to the trend-mountain, most of them also have super wide straps to be safely worn cross-over your body. I deliberately say safely because when their belt is thin, the bag might end up freely moving like a cow’s bell and we don’t want that…no?

interesting crossbody, we need more photos! x

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Here I am on my way to the Vetements show in Paris, ready-to-go and mentally prepared to expect the unexpected. Demna Gvasalia chose to present his S/S18 collection by hanging up life-size photographs (shot by himself) of Vetements-clad Zürchers, in front of the bank, super market and local floral shop. This fashion-show-turned-press-party was a refreshing break from the conventional pace and as always, Demna creates a lot of anticipation and lives up to it with brilliant collections.

Ph Haris Farsarakis

There are times like this when a project comes across your desk that inspires you, brings you joy and more specifically, in our case, teleports you in a cloud of smoke closer than ever to the absolute summer. This editorial’s concept ended up nothing at all like what I had in mind before getting my hands on Rouge Coco, the iconic lipsticks by the eternal Queen, Chanel. The power of their unexpected freshness got me under its spell and I didn’t want to create anything less than my most joyful ever editorial.

So you’ve probably already noticed that my usual make-up ritual is rather minimal, with (always) centre of my attention brows and lips.  But when it comes to my lips lately they are unreasonably chapped and intensely dry. A huge bummer when you love to wear red colours. However when I did apply for the first time the Rouge Coco lipsticks, guys I SWEAR, they literally melted on my lips. “One brow raised” realness for  the most vibrant, juiciest lips I’ve had for a long time. And since I’ve already mentioned that I adore the usually-too-difficult-to-find-summer-reds, I have to tell you that the Coco palette, has the youngest, freshest shades, super easy to apply, worry free, even if your make-up skills resemble to American Horror Story’s clown. Not a good example of a classic beauty but you get it no?

All of the above just because sometimes it’s good to know by a non-proffesional beauty expert that the aforementioned double-C series is the brightest, juiciest lip explosion, you’ll ever have… ENJOY!

 

 

Gorgeous images!
You outdo yourself every time.

Hi Evangelie!
I haven’t written anything for a long time, but I come around almost every day (well, that sounds like stalking). I just wanted you to know that you’re still my style heroine and now you’re also my beauty heroine. This is the best editorial ever, I can literally feel the breeze and the sun on my face…  not to mention about juicy lip colors:) I’m pretty sure I need more beauty editorials from you.

Thank you so much Izabel! You words are everything! I love beauty post and I have some for you in the future.
Lots of love,
Evangelie

The red one is my favorite!

And a small atomic bomb explodes before your eyes……

See I can wear colors…..I can match color blocks with patterns as well….or wear kimonos over shirts…and certainly I can dance claquettes. I can do everything, no? The superwoman with the frivolous cape who will save the world… That bomb has definitely affected my brain cells…Beamed them up to the happy planet!

It’s Saturday people and while everyone is lifting their skirts up(minis are back in town) for an extra steamy summer night , I’m packing! That simple! No, no I’m not complaining. Trust me you don’t want to hear me complaining. It’s a pure denotation of joy. Tomorrow you’ll see me waving from another country. A little breezier than mine…Have patience and follow me on instagram. I’ll set it on fire.

Hello Evangelie,

Can you please tell me about the sizing of these Celine loafers? Do they run small, big or they’re true to size? I’m a 39 and I just found them in 38,5 and I wanted to know if they will fit me.

Thanks xx

Hi Katia,
they’re true to side….I think you shouldn’t size down.
xo

Your hair is stunning! And your outfit too! This kimono is brilliant!

Ohh this is perfect <3

O gosh, an overload of jealousy 😉 Loving everything about this outfit!

WITH LOVE,
LINSEY / POSE-BLOG.COM

Hey, Your hair look great after the cut 🙂 I love the continuing inspiration for outfits ‘topped with’ flat shoes.

Have a nice day!

love the way you rock that kimono with a shirt! you are amazing. xo

love this pattern!!

LA-based Michelle Mason’s take on this season’s hottest hue is sublime as she contrasts the seductive red against the simple and beautifully cut slip that sits oh-so smoothly against the body. This dress has the power to make any one who wears it feel like Wonder Woman.

As the famous saying goes; when life gives you lemons, you make a funny face only when wearing the hottest Brioni sunglasses. Add an extra edge to your look and don't shy away from borrowing from the boys this season, whether it's eyewear or shirts.

‘Tis the season – that lovely time of the year when the Prefall collections drop and all the pieces we’ve been longing for all summer make an appearance in stores. As far as tradition goes, I ordered my favorite Céline shoes from the collection… The asymmetrical Pirate sandal in black, with the hand painted snakeskin heel that both makes a statement and is super comfortable for the wearer.  I’m wearing these babies with my trusted satin and lace Valentino dress.

Massive congrats lovely lady!

I could say many things, but I will just say WOW!! I loved your interview but above all,  the words that impressed me the most are that you’re extremely shy and ridiculously sensitive  maybe because I could define myself  with the same words, except that I’m like abnormally shy, so you’re ok 😉

This bag is phenomenal!

Nice twist on high “low” mix.  😉  Bag is def. high end.  Jumper, long shorts, and trainers to the untrained eyes may look high street but are in fact high end (maybe not uniqlo but still….).  Well done!  🙂

Here’s a quick lesson on how to greet in Norway: Hei x 2, which apparently sounds like hei hei :). Greet them with a smile yet rarely with a kiss. Cheek kiss is quite uncommon, a lesson learned by me, the sassy Greek, after I’ve experienced the total horror in their eyes when I’ve dragged them for a kissieeeeeee. What can I say, on my next visit you should send me a manuscript before I embarrass myself on “I wanna hug him and squeeze him and call him George” situation. It’s not my fault…it’s my genes!

I’m just joking guys, I think that the Norwegians actually enjoyed the new weirdo in town….me.

-So tell us girl, what brought you to Oslo eventually?

Beat the drums……pop up the champaigns….here comes the revelation:

I am working on my first ready-to-wear capsule collection. I am collaborating with the super succesful Scandinavian jewelry brand Tom Wood for the totally designed by me 2014-15 winter collection. Till now it’s an absolutely exciting, most of the times emotional process, such stuff as dreams are made of.

And the name… Heroine by Tom Wood.

Stay tuned…(cliche)

And also HUGE thank you for greetings instruction. You are definitely weirdo, at least for Norwegians, so just imagine the polish total freak who traditionally greets with… three kisses! Ooone, twooo, threee.. and Norwegian flees in panic. Yeah, I will probably practicing before I go into those areas.

P.S. You look fabulous in this super simple summer outfit.

Thank you <3

Photography Haris Farsarakis

Creative direction Evangelie Smyrniotaki

Hermes and Krokus were close friends. In other words, besties. Hermes an immortal God, Krokus a common mortal like us. Hermes was, like all of the Greek Gods, very athletic and one day while practicing discus throwing he accidentally killed Krokus. Hermes was devastated. How on earth had that happened? Gods never make mistakes. Thus, he decided to turn the lifeless body of his friend into a purple flower and his blood into three red stigmas in the heart of it. Krokus was now immortal, forever living in the land of Gods, Greece.
Who doesn’t love a good story… So, the time has come to share my experience of harvesting the saffron for Korres and their Golden Krocus Ageless Saffron Elixir Serum, in Kozani, Northern Greece (or the pure gold of the Greek land as it’s called). By the way did you know that Cleopatra used Saffron in her daily beauty routine? I didn’t… but I have done my research. I actually always investigate ingredients before using products!
So back to last autumn when I was flown to Kozani by Korres to collect the stigmas, the very heart of Krocus, with the locals. According to studies the beneficial properties Krocus are endless. Among them, it is one of the strongest natural antioxidants which neutralizes free radicals, helps control heart rate and blood pressure, is a strong antiseptic and last but not least it has been proven that it helps to preventing cancer. Korres is the first skincare company to use saffron after years and years of research and trials, as saffron is one of the most sensitive flowers that needed an extremely delicate approach in order to be used as a beauty elixir. A small parenthesis: prior to my trip to Kozani I’ve had the honor to visit Korres labs to witness the actual production of this precious elixir. Korres is one of the few companies that uphold pharmaceutical standards. Even the water used for their products is checked three times per day from 20 different sample points, an equation that serves the highest safety standards on planet. Needless to say, their beauty labs look liked taken from a futuristic movie set. 

Returning to the endless purple fields of Kozani, meeting and greeting some of the sweetest harvesting crue, local families that cultivate Krocus from generation to generation. I’m extremely proud as a Greek when Greek companies support local families in their ventures and Korres is 100% one of them. We even had the pleasure to visit a house in the village to collect the stigma from the flowers meeting the sweetest grandmothers with the most glowing skins if that says something… maybe it was this realization by Korres that gave birth to this miracle elixir? I should have asked but what i know for sure though, a couple of weeks since I’ve been using Korres, everybody seems to have noticed the difference on my skin and is asking me… What’s my secret?

So beautiful! I am sold and will definitely try it out 🙂 Can I also ask where your jeans and jacket is from? xx

Thank you. The jeans are from Vanessa Seward and the jacket vintage Prada.xx

Very interesting article! The products must be excellent, as all the Korres products. Very good promotion of the Greek products!

This product looks amazing!
Love,

Jacket, pants, fur and shoes By Malene Birger Fall 15, bag Celine(similar here and here)

The shooting took place in The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Museum.

 

How to make mama-bees to stop? Once they have invaded your personal space you have no choice: You gotta to do their own thing.

Since I actually remember me in adulthood, I also remember my mom’s voice inside my head dictating me:

Were suits! They suit you!

At the beginning I wore them partially to please her and majorly to stop the noise. Later though I realised that my mom, for some extraterrestrial reason, she always knew, before me, what’s better for me. Still I haven’t concluded if it’s a matter of aesthetics or of her pure unconditional love that she’s always right.

So yes mom, suits, suit me better….now I know!



Τόσο ανδρόγυνο και συνάμα τόσο θηλυκό!
Σου ταιριάζει γάντι γιατί ενώ φαίνεσαι άκρως δυναμική, ταυτόχρονα έχεις κάτι τόσο αριστοκρατικό, που παραπέμπει σε άλλη εποχή!

Θα χαρώ να διαβάσω τη γνώμη σου για το νέο blog μας.
Φιλιά, η Ράνια του mademoiselle-rania.blogspot.gr

i love everything about this! miss your dark hair though 😉

I love your style, the best thing about it, in my opinion, is the bag!
I have an elegant and timeless shoulder bag very similar to yours! http://shop.ilbisonte.com/us/bag-vaiva-n-honey_A2269XXPLXUXX264XX.html

This suit suits you to perfection:-)!!
Good proportions, beautiful fabric, right attitude maybe a little a smile?;-)!!

If the subtitle says nothing and you are lost in translation maybe you’ve never tasted THAT. The mega-reason that my husband wants to get the first plane back to California. So what’s DAT got to do with an outfit post? Simply nothing. It’s just one of the endless games my playful mind. My hopping mind. From one thing to another and back. So In N’ Out originally characterized the state of my shirt. Two outfits with just one simple shirt-tucking. What’s best? It doesn’t matter. As long as your shirt doesn’t crumples, the combinations are practically endless….

 

Great look, love this shorts

The perfect little tea picnic in the English country: The picnic takes place near the shore, under a colorful canvas of tents. The breeze coming in from the ocean blending with the warmth of the shadows on the skin…As we are ready to hang up our shoes and play in the sand a gentle wind comes from the sea that makes us wanna snuggle into our checked tweedy coats.

Is it really what Phoebe Philo had in mind when designing her new SS16 collection? I have the feeling that we’ll never know what was in the artist’s head however my brain cells have been exactly at this state of dream during the whole Celine SS16  show, so far my favorite one from Philo. It wasn’t only the need to have the red Chelsea boots that has been haunting me since that day  but also to obtain all of her silk lingerie dresses and camisoles. That recognizable effect of the alluring mingle of the super masculine and the romantic feminine. Celine’s SS16 collection is my ideal way of dressing in a perfect world and I promise you guys if you come a lil bit closer to your screens, I’M SURE, you’ll feel it too.

Oops Phoebe did it again….

Some FABULOUS boots! I also love the checked & lace designs.
Hugs Adele xoxo

French jeweler Charlotte Chesnais is making some of my favorite accessories at the moment – her pieces exude sensuality and simplicity with a twist. Her earrings, rings and necklaces embrace the wearer in unique ways and really stand out. I fell in love with this beautiful, golden hair slip that I either tuck in a tousled updo or wear with my hair down. It adds an effortless touch of sophistication and definitely makes it onto my Essentials list.

Give your nails the best summer treatment and go for Chanel's 562 Coralium polish. I'm wearing it non-stop, it's a fab shade and an even more fab mood-fixer. xx

The last ensemble of my collaboration with Département Féminin was honestly my favorite one. That favorite that it seriously had to be mine. And well… It did. You know me I don’t really get along well with my obsessions. So the “good” preppy dress with the most fragile bow on its neck line, did marry the baddest, sickest biker jacket in the style history and all together, the three of us, did join the Elie Saab ss14 runaway show during Paris Fashion Week. Sometimes it’s good to be bad….no?

Just wow! my words for now!

 Altuzarra top(size 36)/Current Elliott leather pants(size 26)/Isabel Marant pumps(here and here)(normal to size)/Apriari rings/Celine sunglasses

ph Jordan Makarof

Happy Monday and February (of course) fellas. They say that it’s gonna be the month of the not so dynamic power reorganization, since that damn Mercury turns retrograde again but prepare to shine bright at the end it.

– Are you ready for a career change?

No, don’t get me wrong, I don’t see any potential in Astrology for me (yet) but I still find extremely helpful the existence of a planetary manuscript with dos and don’ts, a guide for all our unfocused minds. At the bottom line an excuse from above is always needed when shit happens, no?

So are you feeling passioned today? What, always? Then let’s play. Let’s do a quiz. Note the joyful Altuzarra depicted embroidery. We like it yes but I have a question: Where is it inspired from? I’ll start first and I say the Greek heritage …You?

 

 

This is a model inspired from the Romanian blouses of the 70s. The Romanian blouse has a collective author. It is not a fashion, it is a very meaningful tradition passed by generations of women who lived on the Romanian territory, part of Old Europe – 7000 years ago. The Greek culture has its roots in the Old Europe culture, so your remark is very interesting. 🙂
They used embroidery to communicate specific messages to the seen and unseen world.

Thank you Diana! It’s very interesting to learn how culture affects fashion.

In love with this outfit!

Thank you Dana. I’ll definitely check it out❤️

Dear Evangeline,this is definitely a romanian inspired blouse,as Tom Ford’s black and white(Transilvanian inspired)and Marant,s last ss.We called them IE here,and we still have some amazing original pieces,like the one my mother did when she was just a little girl,totally hand made.Btw,you have an amazing style and plenty of great purcheces to sustain it:-)!Love it!

When packing for trip, I really hate to instagram it. Yes I admit it, I continue to be terribly superstitious but this time I can reasonably justify it.

Listen to me carefully… the evil eye lurks above my insta-account. It’s true…and shit happens. My suitcase was lost! Gone! Puff! I arrived in NY bagless, shoeless, dressless and eventually headless… Thank god the sweetest folks from Intermix , provided me with all the needed awesomeness to survive the first two days of the fashion week.

The above images are the first ones of a series of my collaboration with Intermix and Netrobe for NYFW. Enjoy.

PS: My suitcase eventually was found and sent to my hotel after just two days. You know(evil eye)…don’t mess with me…I’m Greek and Greeks know good spells..:)

Awesome Outfit!You are such a beauty…

Please visit my blog: http://thealligatore.blogspot.de/

Omg I can’t believe your suitcase was lost! Thankfully Intermix had your back and eventually your suitcase made it to you.

that was SCARY!  I hope you don’t have anything valuable in your suitcase (like a Chanel bag or something) for the sticky fingers to steal.

no thank god they returned it two days after 

First photo is fun! 😉

In a total reincarnation of blogging’s Speedy Gonzales, my fingers are on fire people, I’ll be so quick that you’ll probably hate me. Yet with a good reason. I’m in NY!!!!!!!! I’m here with Netrobe  to attend the fashion week  and I just can’t stop gasping in awe of how beautiful the city looks at this time of the year. I shall mind the gaps though….:)

ps. The shoot happened a couple of days before I left, uploaded hastily on the blog, because as we Greeks say, eyes that don’t meet, they’re soon forgotten…:)

 

Love this!! So perfect. You kinda look like Victoria Beckham in these photos 🙂

Lather, rinse, repeat. In an effort to copy myself, this post could surely be an ode to my favorite color triplet. Yes it could. To your own surprise it’s not! Instead of glorying my uncharacteristic attraction to the depicted color-combo I prefer to speak about results.  And every poll has(sometimes confusing) results. Remember? Let the numbers speak:

23%  of you believe that I shouldn’t change anything.

10% that I should combine Zara, H&M etc, pieces with my outfits more oftain.

23% to add beauty, travel, workout posts.

5% to smile more.

The rest 39% of you just don’t read my posts. You love my photos though.:)

Well…when your parenting advice also urges major teeth exposure, you just have to obey to your mama…cause mom insists knows best.? And there surely will be some beauty/travel posts in the near future. Particularly my personal make-up theory is simple yet well-tested. As for the rest 10% of you, I can only promise that: StyleHeroine will continue to stay truthful to my own style. And I personally believe that style is not oriented by tags or brands. I’m not a product seller, I’m only a story-teller and my stories have no boundaries. From H&M to Isabel Marant, I have mixed them countless of times and I’ll continue to, as long as there’s a pretty ending.

One thing is for sure. You’ll only see the best of me.

I just love your panths! nice outfit

impeccable. Where can we get the white Saint Laurent shirt?

I’ve bought it from LuisaWorld. You can contact with them to see if it’s still available.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

ph: Jordan Makarof
Honey, I’m home ! And can you tell the difference? Ehmmmm? Don’t you see my CCF*  against the wall? Yeap…I’m exotically tanned, at last. I’m not going to pretend that my inherited Mediterranean genes helped much on that though. It was  surely a strategically planned act: Spreading my parts like  Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man one and half hours per day, 45 min each side. Alternatively the ideal cooking for the perfect roast beef that is. Yet always sun condomed. Fully spf protected.

So today we’re popping(and not pooping as my grammar spelling corrects) champagnes to the “war of the genders” outfits and obviously my favorite ones. A sexifier in the middle, which btw  I endlessly fell in love from the first sight, and two nerdish concluders. And the boy fights with the girl about who has the upper hand… That darling everlasting fight. Stop sniffing out insecurity! A quick glimpse at the depicted ensemble and you suddenly realize that balance is everything……My hand is on your hand and your hand on mine. Get it? Ahhhh…too much sun, I guess.:)

 

*completely contrasted feet

That last picture could be straight out of Vogue

love these shorts so so so much – can see why fell in love

Thankfifi

Love the shorts!!

That sure is a most marvellous tan! I love the shorts and shirt combo – and the red and white stripes are the perfect detail!

 Wearing Anine Bing shirt, Balmain pants, Alexander Wang Lina pumps, Givenchy Antigona clutch, Chrome Hearts bracelet, Stella McCartney sunglasses.

Red-black-white. And certainly unlike with the pins and puks the aforementioned combination and huge upcoming fall trend will not add any serious anxiety to my usual rusty memory. Don’t you feel that the red was the missing code for unlocking the ultimate color-blocking? Arghhh, I just love that triplette!

Hi you are very chic! Can i ask you how the alexander wang fits? I have the rock stud in 40 1/2… Tank you for your answer!!!

Hi Effe,
they fit normal. Don’t size up. My rock studs are 41 and the Wangs also.
I hope I’ve helped.
xo

Absolutely stunning. The nautical feel of the overall outfit is chic, cool and timeless. I love the way you accessorise, not too cluttered. You get the right balance. I haven’t seen the new season update to the Alexander Wang Liya pumps in the flesh, they haven’t reached London but on you they look fab.

Love the total look. I didnt see this Givenchy clutch! Love it! Where did you buy it?

you look fabulous. love this colour combo. i want everything! xo

I honestly don’t know what i like best, the pants, the bag or the shoes

 Valentino cape/Equipment shirt/Saint Laurent denim/Celine sunglasses
Ph Sara Perringerard for Departement Feminin.

I had no idea but Batman’s other winged-half actually exists. No it’s not me, stop poking me…..I’m just an all grown up butterfly.

Capes as I’ve already mentioned, are all over the place for this Fall, last fall and probably the next one…When challenged at Departement Feminin to find my favorite pieces for the chilly-season, the depicted Valentino outerwear was my first choise. Not that I’m into trends that much yet this cape is a stunning piece in its own simplicity. Soft and warm with a hidden intelligent mystery, made for a rather contemporary femme-fatale in disguise. J’adore!

The cape is to die for!

i love this cape you look perfect and stylish ♥

I had already noticed that cape, and even though I already one black cape, the colour of this one is simply amazing. Love the way you styled it, very simple, but definitely super stylish, and anyway, you can’t go wrong with Valentino !

So far, your collab with Département Féminin has been amazing !

An alternative title could certainly be “never say never” yet never in fashion is a bit overrated:)

Yes, you probably didn’t know it but I graphic t-shirts were not exactly my thing. But tell me something, who could actually resist to Ann Bancroft’s sassy limb? I couldn’t….Hoffman couldn’t. You?

 

 

perfect outfit, that tee is too cute.

This is so cool and fresh! Not to mention that the t-shirt is a badass 😉

ph Haris Farsarakis.

All outfits from SohoSoho. The sunglasses are of course Linda Farrow.
The New Year’s Eve bash might belong to the past for planet earth but on Style Heroine the festivities never end. After a long, long break, I’ve finally returned to my space station, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the most exclusive eyewear in the world. Linda Farrow. No introduction needed I guess, for the brand that has collaborated with great designers such as Alexander Wang, Dries Van Noten, The Row etc. Yeap, these dudes  have seriously and continuously haunted all of my wish lists. So Linda Farrow to beat the drum of her 10-year success , visited some of the major cities in the world to select for each one her muse. Among them Natalie Jools for NY, Tina Leung for Hong Kong and the depicted cat-eyed lady, me, for Athens. Our photo shoot took place at the historic city center and outside of Linda Farrow‘s pop up store at the SohoSoho. Enjoy!

I adore her!

Many thanks to Media Strom for providing us its industrial complex for the shoot.

Just a quickie before throwing my face back into piles of moussaka and pastitsio. Yes…how did you know?…I’m still vacationing at my Hansen and Gretel mom’s house, all cozy on a sunbed, resting my brain cells far, far away from everything. But I’ll be back…to  love you,n hug you, n pet you, n squeeze you…:)

 

 

AMAZING. As usual. What brand are your sunglasses?
Thank you

Designers Remix jacket and bermudas(size 36 both)/Wildwood top/Ann Demeulemeester trainers/Valentino pendant (and here).

Ph Jordan Makarof

In continue to my previous monologue, don’t ever let anyone fool you, stretch marks DO NOT fade away with creams. I’ve dealt with it and spent literally the value of one month’s trip  to Kuda Huraa on them. They’re still there saluting you from the depths of my shorts. Anyways…let’s talk about something happier like dead eagles hanged on chests. Common…have some faith on me, I’m not some kind of a pevert. I just write what I see. My necklace is obviously an eagle, it’s not moving thus it’s dead and even though I have tiny boobs you can see that It still ends lower on my chest. Yet another great trend to come that you’ll remember my sweetest voice telling you:

Told you so!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Amazing pics!!

I read this post and thought “Dafuq?! How come I never checked if I have stretch marks?” and guess what… I have some little “friends” on my butt 😀 Who cares, summer is here, it’s time to show our imperfect skin, ladies!

Moving on… I really like this sporty chic. And dead eagle looks like a cool dude and nice company for summer days!

Again gorgeous !

Shirt bespoke(have you checked out this beauty?)/ Celine skirt and bag(available at LuisaWorld)/Chloe Mules  (and in black)(true to size and super comfy compared to their high heels)/Linda Farrow sunglasses/Tom Wood ring.

Ph Jordan Makarof

That day Jordan had questioned himself:

a: where was our camel ride?

b: why I was wearing heels in the desert?

c: if dune bashing with jeeps makes me sick from nausea. 

For the “c” the answer is a big, fat, shameless yes. Terribly yes. If you seat by me, you’re in danger yes. I-only-do-it-with-an-anti-nausea pill yes.

For the others….dears, this is not a safari session’s look. It’s just a very alternative office look. On the bottom line button up and the “alternative” addition will be vanished.

By the way, next time I’ll make sure I AM the one sitting in the front to Jeep. Now who wants to invite me to Dubai? I am obviously ready!


Lovely! loving the skirt and mules!
BTW have you seen this contest, you can win a 3,000 € wishlist of your choice!
http://www.hiphunters.com/magazine/2014/06/02/win-your-wishlist/

Great classy and elegant safari look!.. Love the length of the skirt and the belt!..  

http://thefashiongals.com

Safari, office, what’s the difference, in this outfit you would rock even the jungle (and stole the Tarzan’s wild heart)!

Normally I’m not a fan of mules, but these are my newest shoe obsession, literally..

aahahahahahahhah❤️

Top, pants and bag Valentino, rings Repossi, all via Departement Feminin

Ph Jordan Makarof

It will be just one more. Oh yes, my collaboration with Département Féminin was pretty fruitful… Was it the Toulousian air? The uniqueness of the ensembles? French country’s astonishing backgrounds? Maybe it’s the mix of everything that created our picturesque editorial. Besides… that’s the way life goes….No? A mix of everything!

 

What a pleasure to see beautiful pics from my town! Indeed, the Hôtel d’Assezat is a wonderful location to shoot. You look great!

Coat, leather cullotes and pumps By Malene Birger Fall 15, bag Celine(similar here and here)

Ph Fransiska Frisesdahl

The shooting took place in The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Museum.

Copenhagen IS a darling. In all terms. Fashion, food, people. It’s been actually my third visit to the Danish capital and it’s delight By Malene Birger. Yes, my third fashion week in Copenhagen made me realize how time flies, even faster than you ever thought possible. And if you ask me if things have been changed, well my answer will be yes and no. No from the site of Denmark, Copenhagen is still the coolest, most likeable and beautiful city in Scandinavia(alongside with Stockholm) with happy and genuinely polite people.  What has been changed thought it concerns to the guests of honor. Same people yet different personalities. It’s really interesting to watch from distance the transition of some of my fellow bloggers. A great part of them continue to be sweet and respectful to the reason that they owe their cyber existence and that is fashion while some others, thankfully a small percentage of them, have been transformed to the point  you actually wonder if you spell their name correctly. Someone will argue that’s how life really is but I’d like to think that blaming life is a huge mistake. In every single fashion week there must always be a silent reminder on the back of our brains that we are here for the same reason, to celebrate the new seasons and feel honored that we have the chance to do so. And HAPPY! That’s all, simple, clear and no drama.

Anyway… back to fashion and By Malene Birger’s F/W 15 show, a collection destined to make women feel good, special and safe. For this winter By Malene Birger has evolved the staples. Essentials like pin-striped and check wool blazers matched with their tapered pants, the most beautiful ribbed tops in jewel tones and my personal favorites, the wool tailored coats(with a soft spot of the one in this mesmerizing midnight-blue shade). This is a collection of key items and you’ll see it coming me wearing them, starting from…. now!

Enjoy!


this a beautiful outfit: masculine ,sleek and chic.  I Iove Malene Birger’s designs.
I totally relate to what you say about bloggers who become full of themselves..There is also one thing I have noticed lately , once some (many) bloggers start to collaborate with grand fashion houses, it goes to their head one way or another and instead of keeping their own style, they turn into boring brand hangers..They forget where they come from, lose purpose and style identity..that is a pity and very boring for the readers, at least,” mature” readers. I am one of these 😉 and I instantly stop visiting their blogs..hmm
Actally, discovering you and your style thanks to  Fashionguitar!.
nice discovery:).!

What a wonderful coat! Shame it doesn’t come with your razor sharp cheekbones 😉
Ana
http://www.champagnegirlsabouttown.co.uk

I absolutely loved your post ! And this is what fashion should be all about… Anyway, I simply adore your outfit, as always !

-Ohhhhh my little onion….
I don’t even know if that term really exists in the universal vocabulary or it was just my mother’s very creative imagination that described my super stuffed looks before sending me to the chilly classrooms. However, what Freud would most certainly say…:

– That all explains your all layer-resistant outfits girl. Childhood trauma alert!

Anyways…I do, try to keep it minimal by any means but when the great cold hits the door, I try to be…how can I say…inventive?! Just to preserve my ability to move you know. For example the depicted wool cape. Warm when it hugs your body, flexible enough to give the much-needed freedom to your hands. You see now? I can move! Even  at zero degrees….

PERRRRFECTION!

In free translation: tarantula is the female character of spidey, or our beloved spiderman. Common you must all know by now that women are much more lethal than Marvel’s super hero/insect. If you don’t then you have come from another planet. Maybe Krypton?!

So here I am at the Celine show,  surviving the Parisian fashion week by using my super-hero(ine) powers and my HERO jacket. Maison Valentino got absolutely playful and this spring will cut the ribbon of a new extraordinary line, the(obviously) Hero collection. The Italian house has created the most exciting line to add some extra special powers to your wardrobe: The powers to turn you into the hottest girl around the block and not only. No joke guys this jacket is fantastic. Comic references, joyful colors and absolutely insane craftmanship: small leather pieces invisibly connected with each other to create one smashing armor.

Take note girls and next spring let’s get all powered by Valentino.

That jacket is just so cool! You look stunning!

The highlighter I’m obsessing over right now  - the Illuminator adds radiance and a beautiful shimmer to your face. Just dab a little of the product on the highest point of your cheeks for some extra luminosity and you’re ready to face the warmer season.

Located in my favourite part of New York, the SoHo Sant Ambroeus restaurant is literally a smargosbord of delicious, authentic Milanese treats. Having already eaten my way through the menu, this time around I tried their avocado toast which is heavenly. Yes folks, Italians do it better - even avocado toast.

Beautifully crafted with raffia and suede, The Row’s Bindle bag is one big slouchy dream that compliments any off-duty look. I would either go monochrome or match this creamy Bindle with any other color from a neutral palette. Less is more… stylish.

Riccardo Tisci’s pissed off rottweilers just landed in Greece, barking  begging us to pet them. And we had no choise but to do that. Now, you wouldn’t mess with an angry dog, right? RIGHT!

If you’re living in Athens you can find them at Luisa World shops.

 

U JUST MADE ME GO WITH THIS SUPER  HOT IN THE CENTER OF ATHENS AT LUISA STORE !!!

During New York fashion week I had the opportunity to work on something quite far from the ordinary with an iconic brand that I truly, wholeheartedly admired for all of my life, a brand that defines elegance like only a few in the world can do. This is none other than Tiffany & Co.

I love jewelry, however I’m very, very picky with it, to my own surprise even more than I am with fashion. I want every piece to feel strong, cool and most importantly to be so uncomplicated in its uniqueness that I could even sleep in it. Difficult? Not at all. To my own delight, Atlas collection has just the right balance of all these characteristics and even more: It also combines a sense of elegance and power, forces that you can only see joined in New York.

So this is our ultimate journey to discover Atlas collection’s real spirit through my eyes and my heart and I refer to my heart because this part of the City is my favorite neighborhood on earth and my very own memory bubble. I really hope this editorial to make you feel like you were there with me, on a rainy day in my beloved NY, feeling strong and more like myself than ever.

Stunning photos! Lovely jewelry!

Alexander Wang Aline sandals(the short heel version)/Celine bag/Glasssing sunglasses/Acne t-shirt/Balenciaga skirt(also available at Balenciaga Boutique Athens)
 Photos by Jordan Makarof.

Many thanks to Media Strom for providing us its industrial complex for the shoot.

I love to hear your cyber voice. I really,really do. And even if there’s always a chance, a tiny little one, that I’ll be the moron who while initially asks for your opinion ends up doing nothing, I have to do it.  So here we go: What would you like to change in this blog? Is there something more you’d like to share with you? Let’s talk about it. We have all the time in the world. Well?

 

 

 

 

some basics of looking great doing activities that I don’t think about them until I’m suddenly in the situation.  What do you wear for a wedding?  To see a major sports match?  Lastly I love your outfits, but then it’s always such a pain for me to figure out what jacket or coat to throw over something.  So either write something describing what jacket or finishing piece you would put over the outfit as outerwear or add an actual photo of you as the final picture in a post with the same outfit plus what you would wear over it.

Don’t change anything. I just love the way you are. xo

Isabel Marant Elena Vest size 38(also here, here and at LuisaWorld) and in black/ Bespoke shirt/ Saint Laurent belt/ H&M shorts/Celine shoes(similar here)

Ph Jordan Makarof

You may have noticed that I have an ongoing fling with toned shoulders. What you probably don’t know is that none out there does them better than Isabel Marant.

Actually I have convinced myself that they illusionary add the much wanted 10 cm to my tiny (wannabe swimmer’s) shoulders. My poor mom obviously knew that someday I would have wished a more toned upper body and urged me to be more active. And I was…hyper-active, on eating. This was the way my little brain had interpreted her command resulting very muscled…Jaws…. Yeap, during my childhood I was a hairy ball. Hairy because I hadn’t experienced lasers yet and my mom didn’t want me to shave my legs until high school (still I don’t quite know the reason) and ball because I was overweight. An overweight sortie. And just like that around the age of 13, a miracle did happen. I suddenly grew taller and surprisingly thinner. The aftermath was some really nasty stretch marks but…who cares…the boys all of a sudden had noticed me! 😉


Absolutely love the look!

Beautiful vest!
http://www.stylespectra.blogspot.com

Amazing editorial and the whole look! You became my number one fashion blogger.

Ahahaha! My father was quite liberal regarding my dressing, acting, choosing etc but he didn’t let me pierce my ears. When i did it at last at 16, he was devostated (and furius) for a week. 

I am sure you were a cute “hairy ball”. Oh, and you rock the brogues situation on all of your related posts.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Happy new year my favorite human beings. The last post of 2013 salutes you from the very festive/cold NY where i’m spending my holidays.
See you again in the not-so-far 2014.
Love you to pieces.

I love the shoes!!!Could you please let me know if I should order them one size down?Thanks on advance!

Hi Kelly,

Love this and the “not what you think” post.  You are a tease!

WhoWhatWear chose you to be the best in couture style of its 2013 bests.  I think the editorial staff made the right choice.  You are, hands down, the best in showcasing couture.  Models are fine but they are not the norm.  You make couture pieces seem attainable (wearable for the mortals) yet still artful.

Can’t wait to see what you will achieve in 2014, be it styling, editorial, or brand collab.

Happy New Year!

Happy new year baby!!! Thank u so much for all your support and all these amazing comments for the past year. I haven’t seen the WWW! Couldyou please send me the link?

Goodness!  I thought WWW would send out a notice to let those who’s featured know that they are on http://WWW….

It’s called 2013 street style award, a list of who’s who in fashion blogging.

Thank you so much. Yes they always send but I am on holidays and i have major issues with receiving my emails 🙂

Great pair of pants! All the best for you too in 2014! : )

Burbery Prorsum trench(size up, too small)/Valentino headband(also available at LuisaWorld)/Celine lace-ups(similar here).

Ph Jordan Makarof

That day everything seemed to be uncomfortably wrong…a very annoying 3D fever(I mean 3-day not some kind of an alien one) did continue to harass my always fragile nervous system – don’t you dare raise your voice to me, I’ll probably (and literally) kick your ass – the walls were burning by a weirdly hot early May sun and last but not least for some still unidentified reason the whole city center had lost power, blocking me behind the garage door…Yet when everything seems to be going against you (“remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it” Henry Ford) go to your wardrobe, grab your favorite piece and get done shot with it (a clueless blogger’s quote).

So If you knew me better you’d definitely had acknowledged by now that I am not a very lace person. I did convinced myself though, that the depicted Burberry Prorsum trench was just another perforated awesomeness. Because you know, brains are pretty much talkable and if you are a little persuasive, they might believe it. Anyways it’s not the first time(and certainly not the last) that I wore a trench for a dress (specially during my nasty early spring mornings). They are easy, flattering, understated sexy. Not to mention that with the appropriate fabric could be evolved to a hell of a masterpiece. A “one of a kind” thing, a head turner, a dream-maker. Don’t get me wrong… just get the look and then we’ll all be happy on a weird May-day! 🙂

amazing trench

I LOVE these type of photos! what camera or lens do you use? xxx

Thank you. You can ask Jordan Makarof makarof.eu about all the camera info.

I had this discussion with my husband this evening of how much I enjoy silence. In our case I don’t… I don’t enjoy being silent for such a long time and most importantly I don’t enjoy my blog being down for the past 9 days. Up and down, up and down. Please accept my sincere apologies for this. We are working hard to find a solution for this problem and trust me we will do. Why this happens? You will the first to know when I will be 100% sure about it.

In any case life is a balance, when something bad happens, something better will come on your way to bring back harmony. And the best is yet to come.

You absolutely KILLED this look! I have been such a huge fan of pinstripes, as a matter of fact, my latest look on my blog has to do with them.  What a coincidence! I love that ribbed sweater with the addition of gloves.  Plus the casual look of your sneakers make for a very chic look.  Love!

Hey, hey.
How are you people? Have you survived the latest solar eclipse? Yes? That’s cool. No? Even cooler. Haven’t you heard that times of great difficulty are times of great inspiration. It’s true. Been there.
Me, your usual suspect, obviously did (survived) and returned uncontrollably chatty to a usual muted post. Because “details” are “speechless”. You should have known by now. So, I confess, I’m having a whole new uncharacteristic obsession with laces lately. On shoes, on pants, on blouses, on dresses. Everywhere. Though I do have a rather intimate relationship with the daring lace-up fronts. Gimme full frontal restrained exposure and I’ll sell my soul cat hmmmmm apartment! And I’m really, really afraid to google it…What? Aspiring masochist? Ai ai ai ai….

 

this jacket is perfection <3 love!

ph Jordan Makarof

Most of you may have noticed my not-so-recent gravitation towards to the completely heelless situations. No nowadays miracles do not really happen and people unfortunately you don’t get taller after the tender age of 17 I guess..That’s not the reason. It’s just this crazy idea stuck in my head, currently unwilling to emigrate to another planet. Outfits do look better with flats! How on earth did it come to this?
-Hey maybe you’re slightly cuckoo….
Well perhaps it’s the spotlessness, the I-can-kick-your-ass easily factor, when a humble flat adds to the whole that I really like. Yeah, I can kick your ass and then run…
-Catch me if you can

Love it!

really cool outfit

Ph Sara Perringerard for Departement Feminin.

Drop and give me 50. My brain’s fitness programs are expanded to my abs for this fall and that’s just because I love to show them! A legal exhibitionist in high rise. Thought my early(trust me, you don’t want to catch the cold in the stomach) fall’s favorite mix, needs the most intelligent pants to be succesful. Pants that are high enough to give you the present of the long legs you’ve always wanted and not too tight around the waist, to avoid giving you the present of the belly-pillow you never wished for. And these ones are perfect. Hedi knows….Really knows how to transform the basic high-waist trousers into these flawless silhouette’s accelerators.  The pants we all need to have in our wardrobes.

When it comes to new collections’ presentations in NY, the productions are so incredible that could be their very own campaign-sets. That has been exactly the case also at Theory’s SS16 showing where my photographer’s, Haris, absolutely talented lens caught the most magical moments of the presentation. Dots, stripes and Theory’s always fantastic suits, everything under the glowing New York’s skies. Enjoy!

Alexander McQueen leather jacket
Ph Haris Farsarakis
Even thought our bodies still needs feather duvets to get protected from the absolutely teeth chattering cold, our mind is travelling directly to the more spring-ish lands where the airy white dresses all that they need is love and well…a leather jacket. The spring collections are already in stores and so an army of very delicious leather jackets waiting for onion-look-alike layers or for more shiny days to cover us.
So cheers to warmer days and to the best leather jackets!
Enjoy!

Many thanks to Media Strom for providing us its industrial complex for the shoot.

The heck with it! I’m getting the return ticket. To Aussie’s lala hot-land, please. In simple english: devilishly destructed denim shorts and an uncharacteristic urge to get a sun kissed tanned skin. Because you haven’t heard? If you can’t be from down under at least you could pretend to. I don’t really know if it’s the unexpected, welcomed though, heat wave that cuckoo-ed my previous post’s logic but my limbs are obviously overexposed again. And because this blog’s intentions are only in your best interest, it’s about time to share with you my biggest bronzing-secret. Clarins Delicious Self-Tan that is…Honestly guys I would better go pale than use a solarium so practically half of my skin’s tone is a result of that little wonder. I only use it only on my body and it blends in really, really well. Plus no streaking, no stains, NOT ORANGE!!! The other half is just…..genes! Glorious, occasionally awkward, Greek genes!

Love your posts your writing and stream of consciousness is so endearing x

Love your sweat and shorts! So casual and sporty!

Fall is literally on our the way, just a step ahead, ok maybe it’s an Olympic long jump for this part of earth since it’s still 35 degrees outside, yet we never stop lusting for the amazing, already in stores, Fall collections. Harpers Bazaar US has asked me, alongside with some of my style heroines, to choose my favorite pieces from this season. One thing to be said: I’ve just stopped struggling with myself and one of them is already resting on my couch….Ouch!
You can see the feature here.
Thank you Harpers Bazaar US for the great honor and especially Kerry Pieri.

Congrats!

Coat Topshop Boutique/ top Carven/shorts Balenciaga(also available in Athens Boutique)/boots Strategia/ bag Pierre Hardy

ph Jordan Makarof
Battling my Monday-blues by showcasing  my most recent(and proven difficult) find in the world’s most extensive research ever!

– Well….you mean after Titanic…

You know I hadn’t realized how impossible it was to find a real pair of flat leather(not suede)thigh high boots in the market. A market by the way, in which apparently the word “just” is missing out of the category “over the knee”.  And one day, precisely about a week ago, when I really thought that I had seen everything, the God of the search engines did mercy me and thunderbolt(ed) these beauties on my non-Mac screen. Eurika! All I ever wanted in a price that doesn’t guarantee the bottom bed in a prison cell….

Hi Evangelie,

Your site is beautiful! Love your fashion style 🙂 

I came across an identical pair of thigh high boots and had a few questions. Sorry, I know this is one of your older posts and you may not have this information.

Is the material stretchy? I am about 175 cm~ with slightly athletic calves. How high does the boot go above the knee for you?

Thank you! 🙂

Hi Alice,
they are not very stretchy and the go very high but they tend to fall…..
I don’t know if I’ve helped much but I’m here to answer if you have more questions:)
xx
E

hi,
the boots are amazing and so is your style.
I am just wondering if they fall down a lot when you are walking?
all my over knee boots become not so over knee after all.
thanks

Hi Wendy,
they are very high on thighs so even when they fall a bit during walking they are still up.
xo

Great boots. How do they run? True to size, small to size or large to size?

Thanks in advance

They are true to size Andy. xo

I love your boots… amazing

Great photos and lovely outfit! 🙂

Please don’t grimace on my blog’s unexpected flush.
-You? The sworn black tyrannosaur are wearing pink?
I agree but then, I redefined my parameters. There are pinks and pinks out there. The depicted one, the “killed pink” well…that color suits me! In a weird way. But that ironically “muted” hue of the most frivolous shade really suits me.
Right now all I can imagine is your sardonic smile and…

-Never say never.

Word!

I think we can all agree that the above black stealthy limb-clothes win the “illusionist of the year” title. Yes, yes. Double score! Look closely at their leather panels. And now let’s hear loudly your thoughs”

-Are they trousers?

-Are they thigh high boots?

-I think I saw them flying!

Exactly. They are superpants! And I love them.

 

the boots…!!!!! :-O

I love your pants, looking gorgeous!

They’re pants?  I’m not sure if that is better than thigh-high boots, which is awful.  Not a fan.

*shoes….dirty, dirty minds…

Of course I’m having a high-heel crisis! It all started about a month ago. No arch pain, nor damn callus. My feet are completely safe & sound, thank you. Just like that, I woke up in a morning and puff….all my heels seemed hmmm….pointless?…unattractive?… misserable?…You got it, no? Meanwhile during a recent phone conversation with God I dared to ask: Can I please, please grow 10cm* taller? Can you do that for me? Gimme a “Karlie Kloss” and I promise, promise I’ll be a good girl! In fact…the best! I’ll never wear naughty heels again! Well…. he has just hung it up..Still haven’t heard of him.  Am I asking too much?

But no worries. If I’m going heel-less…I’ll do it well. I’ll man it up! I guess the date of reconciliation with the ballet flats hasn’t come yet.

*cause I know you’ll ask me, I’m 1.72 🙂

 

 

 

Wow, stunning outfit, TRES CHIC! Lovin’ the flats!
P.S: If you wanna talk about short, I’m 1.56 or something like that, haha!

Apart from my mom who was deliberately chasing me with a fork in her hand(she thinks believes that I’m tooooo skinny, almost invisible) and an hysterical-me trying to crush the momflated** calories by swimming like a pro, nothing much really happened the past weekend. No drama….more. But I’m still vacationing…so who knows…

Today it’s all about shorts that turned to bermudas. And please don’t scold me about the inevitable consequences of oversized shopping especially considering my burdened past. This happened…not. This time was a mature, cautious decision. Even thought the hardly-cover-your-cheeks high-waisted  devilish hot pants are lately da thing, masculinely pleated bermudas that would give my crotch the much-needed summer-breeze were what I needed(last week). Never found…Nowhere. Yet I’ve thought that I wouldn’t mind to create one. But how? DIY? Guys….I can hardly sew a button. A tailor? Anyone to recommend? All complicated. But  those frozen icy blue Chloe shorts with their softest ever silk…ahhhhh they stole my heart. There should be way. These shorts were meant to be taller …longer.? Longer…yes! Like three sizes up? Mmmm…Not exactly a stroke of genius but..tah-dah! A  bermuda! Miracolo-La vita è bella! Siiiiiiiiiiii!


**Hybrid: mom-inflated

Gosh you’re gorgeous, adore your style!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Loafers Celine(similar here)/necklace Balenciaga/shorts Saint Laurent(size up)/shirt Saint Laurent/Lulu bag Saint Laurent (available at LuisaWorld)
Ph: Jordan Makarof

First they were up and then they were down. Up, down. Up, down.

And while the whole blogosphere may be marching up and down on deliriously sky-high heels with the hands locked in pockets* I’ve decided that you can’t just always go with the flow, because I tell you sometimes the flow flows in cataract. Surprise! So I gave some desperately needed Celines rest to my heat-waved feet and  laid against the most beautiful chestnut-brown door I’ve ever seen…   Because the bottom line is how do I impress dress up in real life when strolling through Athens in seriously hot weather?..Flats & shorts is the only answer….

 

*BTW did you know that your hands’ body language reveal  unwillingness, mistrust and reluctance when in pockets? Ahaaaaaaa….that good!

Love your shirt and shorts!

I don’t think it really matters if the heels are up or down.. You can still figure out great look,right?

Legs for days! Those shorts look awesome on you and of course you’re working the denim on denim combo perfectly. The pairing with the loafers is too good. Spot on and amazing babe!

ph: Jordan Makarof

Instagram is definitely taking the photo sharing to a whole new miraculous level.  You post something good, that simultaneously get’s caught by the usual eagle eyes and then, if you have already done the mistake and you haven’t hashtag it……you get bombed! Email bombed. My girls know what they want and they want it now!   So here It is ladies, the black McQ leather tight awesomeness, that everybody loved when worn back at Malene Birger’s SS14 show, in flesh and blood link. Now you can have it ;)…


It is incredible.x

Thankfifi

The skirt looks awesome on you.
you just got the charisma 🙂 Loved it

You’re really amazing. You always have the key pieces of each collection. How do you do? ^^

Hands down guys, if I have to play the little hide and seek in-the-coziest-jacket game, it will be only the depicted one. It’s by far my favorite fall topping, carefully chosen with care and flair from MyTheresa‘s massive fashion avalanche. You’ll count…I’ll hide in it…How does it sounds? Is it a deal?

-1…2…3…

-Oh, I love you!

Great look!

Ph: Jordan Makarof

Anything could happen. Dressed like a boy scout gone navy is the one thing. To put on 3kg in just five days is the other. So what girl? Who cares? Get a life! Well ladies, stop hissing at me. You know, you actually don’t know, for years now my pride( and the potential subject of universal studies) was my faster than bolt metabolism. In simple english, eat like a pig, burn like a rocket. Until now I was a well-oiled-machine that could indulge to everyday junk food with no regrets. I swear guys, It was better to dress me than to feed me. Got it? Sure you did.  And now…what I’m gonna do? I really loved eating like Phelps before the final race. Is it an ambiguous “happily ever after” in front of me? pffffff…So many question, so little time…And I have to go running in the morning….:)

*The pics are before the Armagedon

 

 

 

love that bag……

You are the lucky one! When I eat like a pig I always successfully manage to  look like one.. Well…I love that top!

Ph Jordan Makarof

Isn’t it the most outrageous quote on planet earth(look at the tittle)? But you have to admit it guys, we all just love saying that.

So my little Drama Queens, to your own surprise, this time indeed it’s not what it looks like. In the background are not the frozen peaks of the Swiss Alps.


-Okay, you are Greek no? You must be at…Arahova?!

It’s NOT snow! Avalanche risk level is below zero!

-Not ? And what on earth is that not-snow-white thing on your back?

Hmmmm…can’t tell… Jordan will kill me if I do reveal his secret locations and I haven’t left a legacy yet. 🙂

Anyway..I don’t know if  you have really noticed  but from now and on there will be some additional information associated with my ensembles. Sizing that is.  I find it amazingly helpful to know the depicted outfit’s size when shopping online and I’ve been thinking(loudly):  if this is the way that I, a caring individual, could contribute to humanity, so be it!

Altuzarra skirt, size 36(here and here)/Custom made shirt/Maison Martin Margiela necklace(also here), M size/The Row clutch/Tom Wood pinkie/Dior pumps.

Ph Jordan Makarof

Don’t you all aim for comfort when dressing? Well I do! I have that super weird syndrome, when wearing something tight around my ribs I get a back-pain. Am I the only one out there?

Anyway I am not sure that Altuzarra did have the comfort factor in mind when designing his latest S/S collection yet the evenings got real airy. And what I love most is that towelling effect. Super loose textiles wrapped around the waist and totally summery slim red zigzag stripes running down on the softest cotton. A breezy Carribean night…you do feel it no?

You can see the whole feature on Harper’s Bazaar US here.

That skirt is a beauty as are you!

FOHH:Fear Of High Heels

One post that could be no other than celebrating the end of the fashion week in flats and denim. Yes the New York Fashion Week is officially over, bitter-sweet end, if you will. My exhausted part pops-up champagnes yet my fashion instincts are kinda of depressed. New York this time has been a wonderful experience for me as I’ve had the honor to be the ambassador of L’Officiel Italia for the whole week. All beautiful things come to end…or not? Stay tuned.

This outfit is amazing. The pieces are basic, but have such a unique twist! And those slingback heels are gorgeous…

 Haider Ackermann Jumpsuit, size 34(here and here)/Ann Demeulemeester trainers/The Row clutch/Tom Wood pinkie.

Ph Jordan Makarof

Something old, something new, something blue?! Naaaaa, not any good comes by adding the aforementioned shade near my face.

At last styleheroine.com is fully operational and I can gladly present to you one by one the outfits from my most favorite so far editorial. As you might already know the “challenge” was to demonstrate my life in three looks for Harper’s Bazaar US. And what’s better than a jumpsuit to make the introductions? I am literally(and clinically) obsessed with the all-in-ones and if I had an infinite budget I’d probably have bought the entire global jumpsuit production. I blame genes and more specifically my mother who she equally loves them. She blames my inherited boredom to mix and match. So that’s why layering is not quite my thing….More match…got it?

You can see the whole feature on Harper’s Bazaar US here.

 

Love your nail polish color! Can you share the name and brand?

Hi Karen it was Shelac i think the shade Merlot❤️

Thanks! Will request it for my next manicure

  Celine sweater/Valentino Flannel top/Valentino Drawstring pants/Celine snakeskin sandals
Ph Sara Perringerard for Departement Feminin.

A short lesson, monotone is a Greek word meaning dull and tedious. In our case though, I’d prefer to keep the English interpretation, “a continuing sound” that is . The sound of colors. Of course the colors have sound, don’t you ever hear them? Alarming red, canary yellow, ocean blue…all in the great symphony of senses.

And how’s grey’s sound dear?

Well for the past two years, when pronouncing the “G” word, the entire universe  simultaneously gets an earful from the lively Christian Grey’s naughty room. I’ve made your day!? Do tell!

So back to Department Feminin, the pink city(Toulouse’s nickname) and the depicted outfit, a beautiful symphony of four shades of grey. A mix that can be worn from day, if you add a pair of white Eytys sneakers, or on a night out with the above sexiest Celine snake skin sandals. I really have a soft spot for these kind of outfits. The all-day, all-weather, easy-going, not-much-to-think-about outfits. Because when you already have a million things in your mind, versatile-dressing might be your savior…

You can see the whole editorial of my collaboration with  mytheresa.com  here.

How can you celebrate fall in this part of the world when you are still packed like sardines on the mediterranean shores just to preserve your already degrading tan?

-Poor you. Life was never meant to be a struggle!

-Of course irony was a border we  hadn’t crossed…until NOW!

Anyway…last week I got to do the honors at the celebratorial-fall ribbon-cutting ceremony with an exclusive photo shoot for MyTheresa  and my favorite seasonal pics from it’s never-ending  fashion amazingness . My choises were as simple as my style moto yet so hard to live without…at least for this fall! First pic, there will be two more,  the skirt that made me realize that sometimes I do need to step out of my tomboy comfort zone….

That skirt is very cool!
Love the outfit.

Tuxedo jacket Helmut Lang(also here and here)/ shirt Dries Van Noten/pants Alberto Biani(also available at Freeshop)/shoes Valentino/ necklace Ileana Makri/ sunglasses Sheriff & Cherry ph Jordan Makarof

So here I am, dressed as a serious danger, to answer the greatest question of all time: Am I a bag or a shoe girl? Whoever guesses correctly will win two tickets to the Yeezus concert. Joking but Isn’t it the thing of the moment? However to put things straight, it turns out that Kanye’s Holy, I’m-a-kinda-new-age-Moses,  Mountain themed concert is(even if you’re not big fun of his music) not boring a pleasure for your eyes.

-You’re off the topic girl….We’ll give you an F.

Anyway If you were better than me in astrophysics, I doubt it though :), you’ll have already guessed the answer…I’m an unconditional shoe girl. I always knew it but after Paris I am also sure about it. Yes my darlings, I can even survive a whole fashion week without a bag!

-How come?

Well I’ve bought a Smythson card holder. That simple. So If you have your money, your hotel’s card key and your shoes on what else would you need?

– Some makeup maybe?

I always use minimum make up but if there’s something missing out in this bag-absence equation, that might be an iPhone charger. Is it just mine or all those damn mobiles’ batteries don’t last longer than Downton Abbey’s Christmas episode?

Then again, most of the restaurants outhere, they do have a spare one to save the day. So…..tell me now…Who needs da bag?

Absolutely love this.

Ph Jordan Makarof for Harpers Bazaar US

Beat the drum! Pop-up the champaigns! Styleheroine got a facelift! At last. We needed it somehow, to go with the flow, don’t you think?

So this is the new me, a new(per usual) minimalistic me yet flourished with more categories and eventually more posts to be inspired. We are not 100% ready but you can have a taste for things to come.

And what a better way to celebrate than a US Harpers Bazaar editorial! My life is demonstrated by 3 looks in a massive photo-feature as well as by Kerry Pieri’s coolest questions.

You can enjoy my favorite ever editorial here.

Thank you Harper’s Bazaar team and especially Kerry. I LOVE you.

 

Love your new “look”, especially the maintaining minimalistic design part.  This approach truly highlights you and your style (no clutter).  🙂

Congrats on the editorial.  HB US knows talent when it sees one (in you).   You have what it takes to be a dark Kate Moss.  If Kate made it at 5’7″, you can, too.

Thank you so much!!!xoxoxo

Bravo theaaaaa!!!!

One of the biggest trends of the season is the flower pattern. A pattern that is pretty flattering as flowers add a lot of femiminity to your usual style. Here we have selected the best piece of this trend for you... what else Balenciaga!

In honour of Prada's cruise collection that will be shown today in Milan, my feet have just wore Miuccia's most celebrational feathers. In fact one of my favourite heels for the season.

Your style-heroines are back with a dress to kill.

 Celine dress/Boots Chanel.
Ph Sara Perringerard for Departement Feminin.
I am the only one who actually thinks that the shape of this dress, highly resembles to the otherwise cute animal? Armadillo(yes) and my imagination obviously went wild in the French Country side. French Champagne and fromage, a combination that seriously brought some light fizz to my brain cells.

So back to the Mediterranean coast and totally sober :), we cut the ribbon of my new collaboration with my beloved on-line shop Département Féminin with Phoebe’s slickest dress, a silky armor shell, a shameless show stopper, if I may…Even though the word “princess” is almost banned from my style vocabulary, you have to admit it… Don’t I look like a runaway one? This dress, I’m telling you is an endangered species, a really rear one and per me the best piece of Philo’s pre-fall collection. J’ adore!

Nice dress!!!

Well, who said that the armadillo can’t be a princess? At least some kind of…;)
This dress is really unusual and unique (I like both of those words, couldn’t decide on one…), totally made for you:)

And another dream collaboration, congratulations! I can’t wait to see more.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Mikoh swimwear(in size small).

Ph Jordan Makarof

I’ll better start introducing my self, well(if you don’t already know) I’m Evangelie, a Greek born Pisces, which automatically means two things for me: One is that I love the sea ( it’s in my genes) and two…the sea loves me back(it’s written in my stars). So I couldn’t help but to choose  my favorite sport , swimming, a sport that apart from a healthy body gives me a piece of mind, in order to celebrate Net-A-Porter ‘s newest family member Net-A-Sporter. A whole new era dedicated to the strongest girls who need to sport in style. Well, we all do need an excuse to start working out  and….we’ve just found it. Swimwear, trainers, dance clothes, running pants, made to not only perform but also to stun. Enjoy super heroines!

I don’t know if they’re knee high boots or whatever, but the outfit from the second photo is rocking!
btw. I had the silver stickers, brought in sephora this summer!  the thing is awesome , but it’s very tricky, and I don’t have a steady hand so they turn out ugly 😉

xoxo Nicol

Hi Nicol… In the second photo are boots. Aren’t they awesome? You’re so right about the stickers… Very very difficult..

Nice round up of images. Where does one find silver nail polish that looks “that” metallic?
BerryHaute

Thank u ;-)… Usually a soooo silver nail polish is a sticker!!! I believe I have seen them in Sephora. It’s nice for a change…

Acne skirt/Acne sweater(and black)/Pierre Hardy bag/Ann Demeulemeester boots/Falke socks
Ph Jordan Makarof

-Arghhhhh..hmmmmm…we cannot see any difference..Are we blinded?

-Only temporarely… no worries.

So let me be the naughty one who’s gonna spill the beans: It’s the hair guys. These pics were taken approximately a month ago when my precious brain neighbored then with my lighter locks. Now I mention that, you’ve never commented on my recenly “darker” look. Actually I don’t know If I have ever told you but the very dark brown, or else the almost black , is my natural hair color. All the others were just fast trips to the blonde, happy planet.

Getting another return ticket, this time back to the seriousness of describing an ensemble, let’s talk about slits and the world of the peekaboo skirts. The depicted one was bought from my recent trip to Stockholm. I usually travel with a lighter suitcase because I really love to buy useful souvenirs and what’s more “useful” to me than my own clothes? Naaaaa, nothin else, I am a humble blogger you know…So when in the Swedish capital, the original plan was to visit as many Acne stores and pack as much as I could. The plan could have more success if the aforementioned brand didn’t have out of stock my size in most of their goodies.

-Please Acne mega mind if you can hear me right now, please restock. You see there are more of us and we are demanding.

Anyway, with slits I am kinda of strict. Either it goes all way up or it goes home. As a matter of fact, I think that the small ones are totally unflattering. But if it is still a shock for your previously conservative status to be( half) publicly exposed, you can just add the most asexual parts of your wardrobe and….tadaaa….the harmony is back as it supposed to be. You create the harmony.

 

 

 

Beautiful !!!

Lanvin headband/Saint Laurent boots/Saint Laurent leather pants/Saint Laurent jacket/Stella McCartney bag (available at LuisaWorld)

Photos by Jordan Makarof.

Many thanks to Media Strom for providing us its industrial complex for the shoot.

Hey lovers…it’s been awhile, I know, but I had to deal with a major lunar eclipse a couple of days back and another is yet to come, this time a solar. Oh là là, …That’s  noooo good. No,no,no.

So let’s turn back to the present and this, my favorite so far, going all-black shoot. If you didn’t know me any better you’d probably guess that the aformentioned powerful eclipse-rays have alternated my last remaining vulnerable brain cells that much to believe they surely belong to the Tomb Raider heroine’s body. However you DO know me better and I don’t have any  guns hidden away in my fringe bag.  It’s just that my dearest ensembles often come along with the quote  “That lace might sexily go all the way down to my chest yet these Saint Laurent combat booties could definitely kick your ass.”


By the way I haven’t actually ever confessed to you my greatest fitness workout crush. Do you remember Angie’s  bungee ballet scene? How cool was that? I know…. It’s not that realistic but can I please try it? Just once. One flip. Only. Common….

Some things like this iconic (Yves) Saint Laurent jacket will always remind us the greatness of the founder of the House, no matter how it is becoming under its current Creative Director.
Your collaboration with Jordan (Makarof) is resulting in some great photos, both artistically and commercially, and they could easily belong to a high-fashion editorial.
Well done and… keep him close!
xx Margarita

Gown Konstantinos Melis by Laskos/ Boots Saint Laurent(also check out this awesomeness)
ph: Jordan Makarof
Keep the cyber-phone on so I can hear you and start counting…One, two, five, ten..what? Fifteen? In just three months? Zeeeeeez…if you’re going to rob a bank, definitely wear a wig.
I have only a three-wedding summer. Yet all in this month.

So when you’re pretty restricted as to an exhausting all-night floor sweeping, what would you wear? Well that’s more of a self question, don’t hurry your precious minds …For the moment(and for the upcoming one) I’ll go with the (depicted) -silkish perforated-flow. No bold colors, no sparkles, no blingy accessories. No. no. no. Just a tasteful high middle slit and an epic-tearing up the grass- trail.  I can live my myth in this…Can you?

 

i ADORE those pics, really cool vicsmarketlondon

wow! gorgeous <3

Such great photos i really love the peace in your face and the dress just perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

awwwww, I’d rob a bank to travel to greece to rob a bank with you!

  Adidas sneakers/ Stella McCartney pants
Ph: Jordan Makarof


I could spend an entire day talking about that  green blast from the past and all the happy memories being carried over but I have to pack folks and you don’t want to me to walk naked through the streets of Copenhagen….. 🙂

 

Got a flashback from the past too 😉 Those Adidas were one of my first pair of sneakers (with yellow stripes). Love them! Think it’s time for a Adidas Superstar revival! flaircat.com

Reminds me of college days!

Coat Wildwood/knit Maison Martin Margiela(and in white)/leather leggings Helmut Lang/ boots Strategia/bag Balenciaga
ph Jordan Makarof


Let’s begin with something very irrelevant! Did you see Homeland’s season finale? Gosh! What was that? No, please don’t worry, there won’t follow a spoiler so you can freely open your eyes and listen to my mini yet loud demonstration: That end completely sucked. It was an epic failure. Yes you know who you are… Yes I’m pointing my finger at you, you…terrible producers. You suck!

There it is, I’ve said it!

Abundant sunshine will continue for the rest of the day as we will march on the familiar fashion road. So you have the leather pants. the black knit, even the thigh high boots for your winter essentials. But what’s the most basic of all that if you haven’t yet possessed you probably face a never-ending wardrobe malfunction? By the latest I certainly do not imply, exposing publicly your nipples. It’s just that without a grey coat, yes that’s the answer, you simply make your life difficult. It’s the most basic item of all, matching practically with your whole closet saving you from the painful clothing-puzzles. You see, I love being a problem solver but out of my closet.


 

I adore that coat– Such a dramatic look!

*Stands for chic.

Trivia of the day: Why they do find men in uniform so attractive? And the most crucial question, does the same apply to women?

If yes then I’ve made myself totally irresistible in a half surgeon attire. And I say half because my lower part resembles to a sassy amazon woman ready to wipe out of existence every singe male chromosome. No, no,no, please don’t worry, (for now)genetic genocide will be certainly avoided. The doctor inside has been taking me over. By the way have I ever mentioned that when in high school, I had been  studying to be a good Samaritan doc? Yet life, as always, had different plans.

Love it !

  Wearing Isabel Marant top and pants, Celine bracelet, Dolce & Gabbana sunglasses.
Most of you have probably noticed a completely hateable change on me but I know that you’re too kind to mention it. Yes my hair has been ridiculously chopped again. A traumatic experience. Kaput. However the evil scissorhand hairdresser doesn’t really know that my amazing spiderman hair will eventually revenge her and with a little extra pampering they’ll grow again in no time. Anyway today’s post has nothing to do with my locks or the red alert outfit. It’s all about the thing that sits on my face aka the mirrored sunglasses. You see, I was in a quite extensive search with no luck for something like that for a couple of weeks. It was only on Friday though that I’ve had a (rare) eureka moment. If I couldn’t find the ONES I should make them. So I went to a shop and the first thing done was picking up a frame. A matte acetate D frame.The matte finish is the perfect contrast to the reflecting lences.Then comes the hard work. Choosing the mirrors. There’s a massive collection of them out there. Gold, red, purple, green etc. For me the silver ones were the perfect contrast to the iridescent brown Dolces and my pale complexion.The technician adjusted them in just 10 minutes and tah-dah…That was it! My new brand new sparkly synnies were born. Like? Tell..tell

I love your top!! Where can I find this exact one? The one you linked to has much shorter sleeves…thanks!! 🙂

Hi Melanie, unfortunately it’s from the previous season and the short-sleeved one was the closest I could find…<3

Love that they are so personal and customized, they look great on you! <3

Plus, I wouldn't worry about your hair, it still looks perfect!
x

I absolutely love this outfit! Great job!

You look stunning!

  Wearing Acne Parrish shirt Maje leather shorts (completely similar here), Celine sandals, Givenchy Obsedia bag, COOEE moon necklace, Stella McCartney sunglasses. The colorful detail belongs to Christine’s  amazing Isabel Marant Air printed cotton-jersey sweatshirt. The interior shots are from our beautiful hotel St. George Roma.

In a town that the real chic Italian heart is still beating, I delightfully abandoned in the hotel my typical flip-flops/harem pants tourist uniform and gifted my legs with the most amazing sandals in the world, just to live their own frivolous Dolce Vita.The last day in dreamy Rome was a pure seduction of all senses, a mix of amazing flavors, scents and sounds, a life as it should be…

Isabel Marant shirt/Saint Laurent denim(here and here).

Ph Sara Perringerard for Departement Feminin.

A kiss only in words, is not another empty promise. On the contrary. I totally adore you. It’s just that I’m a bit shy when it comes to express my feelings. It’s a work in progress though, so I might surprise myself in the near future.

Back in Toulouse for a couple of days for a shoot-extraordinaire with my favorite people from Département Féminin, simultaneously discovering a) that stripes actually do work with the French country side and b)Toulousian coffee unexpectedly keeps you forever alarmed. Bip Bip.

Toulouse…enjoy !
I have a similar shirt and I love it !

Isabel Marant shirt(Marant happily produces tt every year, still available at LuisaWorld)/Saint Laurent skirt/Saint Laurent boots(soon at Zara)/Chanel Bag/LGR for APC sunglasses.

Ph: Jordan Makarof

Let’s start with the following hypothesis: if  Phoebe’s mega-mind has already added fluffy furry creatures, the ultimate winterizer, to the summer’s most anticipated sandals, the, now infamous, Birkenstocks then why don’t we all wear leather in the heat?

– Because we’re all gonna faint from the fumes of our boiling parts. Are you nuts?

–  Whatever…Ignorance is the best revenge so…

If every hypothesis needs to get tested by an experiment well I’m the live one. Don’t you see? I’m still happily standing.

Daddy’s shirt/ Balenciaga wedges, skirt (available at Balenciaga Boutique Athens, similar here) and necklace /Saint Laurent Lulu bag (also available at LuisaWorld)
Ph: Jordan Makarof
Hellooooo queenies from the surprisingly warm London, the city that it’s another city(greeklish*) when the first rays of summer fire it up. So  here I am in seventh heaven, totally ecstatic, for something very special, surely fantastic,  but I really have to be muted about it. Let’s face it nobody wants an overly chatty mouth that spoils surprises, no? The only thing I can really say is that…you’re gonna love it!

Anyways you’ve been continuously asking me what to wear in a wedding. How about a naughty Lambada skirt that dangerously rises to censored levels while demonstrating your notorious dance moves? That would make an impact! Common….let’s dence.

*hybrid Greek-English

 

 

Hi.
I´m thinking of getting the Balenciaga wedges. I have heard that they run small in size.
Did you go for your normal size or 1/2 size up?

Regards.

Hi Lisaa, indeed I’ve sized up 1/2! I now proudly wear 41 1/2 🙂
xoxoxo

incredible outfit, that skirt is amazing on you!

That skirt is is tooooo cute!!!

GIRL, YOU LOOK AMAZING!! WORK IT GIRL!!!

Is this skirt still available anywhere? I’m assuming not…haha

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

It's been a long time since we actually saw a new genre of the denim family. Lemme introduce you to the ruffle bottoms or else the big sister of bell bottoms. More dramatic and more girly but in a way we all want...

Turtleneck Vetements season 1

Denim Vetements season 1

Gucci Bengal tiger striped intarsia jumper

Hands down, Marni has one of the best accessories-line outhere and boy this season's earrings are too good. As I'm more into round and bulky shapes lately, these ones are my favorite. Extra bonus, they are super light so this time style comes with no pain.

Ph Jordan Makarof

Fashion has no rules. Rules are for the Navy and as far it concerns me, I always get seasick. Ahoy sailor!!! Naaaa, if only the mere thought of cruising  seas sends my stomach lurching, can you really imagine a reality check?

So I had this Chloe knitted dress that could only be worn with its vicious V happily pointing at your toes (as Clare Waight Keller had originally in mind) only a: If you were Rihanna or b: if you could layer it. You know that between layering and me, there’s no romance so my latest habit took over. Turned it around and I like it it worked!  So why to bother with lookbooks and style rules? My spinal claimed its freedom and Chloe’s perfect tailoring, gave it back! Woot woot, “free the back”, a thought that I also have kept in mind during the whole designing process of my first capsule collection…More on this soon, so soon.

 

Rihanna queen.

The dress is to die for!

Happy Easter you lil bunnies. Where do I find you? I’m currently pigging at my family house, enjoying the traditional festivities with a mama bear who daily cooks like she wants to feed a whole army. So let’s all celebrate the occasion with( no I’m not gonna use the cliché sparkling) the best fitting pants ever….while we can still fit. Oh have I just done the rime thing?…Dude who could tell…

I’m trying to decide which I love more – the pants or the fringed Valentino clutch – together they look AMAZING.

Retrograde: Moving backwards.

Hello style heroines. Your favorite station blog is transmitting live from New York with a shout-out from the past and more specifically from six moths ago. Such a complicated personality….I know…But as I’ve told you in my previous post ” sometimes is good to look back to go forward”.

The Big Apple for me this the time is an actual delight as there are huge projects coming up that I’m extremely proud of….Stay tuned!

PS: Now that I’ve reminded you my last April’s blonde locks, how do you prefer me better? I haven’t heard a word from you!

Love the androgynous vibe to this look. I think you suit a brunette more, although blonde looks great on you. What I’m loving is your fringe in your most recent post of NYC, it really suits you.
Hugs Adele xoxo

You look adorable. The high-waisted pants add a timeless touch to the outfit and the suspenders really spice it up. I love suspenders and feel so comfortable when I wear them.
I prefer the blonde hair color.

Oh là là, this black and white is perfect on you !!!

http://www.pardonmyobsession.com/

Another amazing post! I love this outfit – and as for your hair, I prefer it dark I think! But I am a dark hair kinda gal, I also loved the bangs and you inspired me to get some cut in a while ago. I have since grown then out AND cut my hair into a bob because everything was getting a little too high maintenance! 

Shot From The Street | Fashion Blog

I’m super happy for you and your projects, it’s really amazing to watch your journey through all these years. Wish you luck with everything what’s coming up for you and can’t wait to see it!

Oh, about hair.. You look awesome as a blonde and I’m pretty sure you would rock even a pink mohawk (not quite sure about pink though), but personally my favorite look is brunette with bangs. I feel like bangs adds a bit of nonchalance and character, if you know what I mean. It just really suits you:)

You’re fortunate to be able to carry off both looks beautifully, but I prefer brunette. It’s a sophisticated and striking look for you.

I m afraid i agree with your mom….  brunette!

Wearing Zadig & Voltaire holey  pull, Current Elliott leather pants.

It’s been sometime since the last exposure of my inner self through holey tops, probably was the previous summer, but this Zadig & Voltaire’s cozy wool knit  glamored me, proving to be December’s greatest fashion find.  I swear to you guys, embracing the winter air never felt fresher.

love this look so so much:) the leather pants are amazing, and i love holey shirts;)

Editing by me

Trend, trend, trend…

Oh stop it..is it necessary to fry ours ears with that annoying alarm?

-Of course it is. You’ll witness it massively next season and then you’ll complain that I haven’t informed you.

So here I am, with my scarf wrapped highest than ever strutting up a down like a peacock, demonstrating my favorite upcoming trend.  Straight from the runways the thick scarves will do wrap around a major part of our upper body, making things a bit sexier per me…undercovered sexy… Who’s there?? Let me see….

sigh…what i wouldn’t do to trade closets for a day (week?  month? forever?!) with you!
the scarf is ahh-mazing!  and no one can style it better then you…so pretty as always!

question about the saint laurent booties–not sure how much you’ve worn them so far, but are they comfortable and do you find them stretching at all?  after putting in a few calls to my favorite nyc shops the past month, i finally got a call from one that they found a pair in my size..well, sort of–they’re a 40, i’m usually a 40.5…they reasonably fit albeit a tad snug in the toe box.  wondering if i should suck it up and keep them in the hopes they’ll stretch or pass em up and fingers crossed a larger size comes my way?

thanks!  and sorry for chewing off your ear 🙂

erm..i’m an idiot!  after writing that long-winded plea, i clicked on your link above…matches has my size!  

sorry…disregard above…i’m ordering 40.5 and feeling like a fool for not clicking your link in the first place!!
xx 🙂

you are hilarious my darling❤️ you are definitely gonna love them and they are so damn comfy.

That last photo is so beautiful babe… AND you have the scarf!! Wooohooo

Editing by me

As you may have witnessed I keep things triplicated* so much that I’ve decided to create a brand new category on styleheroine, the triplettes, or simpler the way I most adore to wear colors. In three. No more, no less. The mix of just three shades of the endless color palette. For example in the depicted “under house” arrest outfit, it’s the symphony of black(of course, it’s always about the black), white and a pop of yellow. That’s it. And honestly I always find it sooooo exciting to break the balanced relationship of a colour couple with a joyful intruder. In the past it was the camel, the red , or even recently the pleated white. Let’s sum them up and kinda box them…What?! You don’t understand? Patience, things will change on styleheroine….

*triple-complicated, hybrid

Love it…

Can’t wait…

miss you

Wearing Isabel Marant fur, Topshop knit, Etoile Isabel Marant white top( you can find it here in burgundy), Topshop body, H&M PU pants and scarve, Isabel Marant sneakers.

I suppose it’s Tommy Ton’s PFW sartorial captures which injected me with huge expectations of sharing loads and loads of images of  my fiercest outfits on the streets of Paris.  But as my wise grandmother said, when you make plans  God laughs, this time God cried of laughter and soaked the city of light with freezing pouring rain. Did my fur-ry tail gone bad? Nope, the true beauty is on the inside and Paris has a lot to say about this. So on our last day in the French capital, instead of posing outside of the Grand Palais, we were seduced by the delicious smells of the truffes in one of my favorite restaurants in the world: La maison de la truffe, the little gem at the Place de la Madeleine. Ohhhhh I love Paris….À bientôt!

                                               Bye bye my sweet room…….

you outfit makes me be so jelaous!I want thoose sneakers that badly!!!!! her are totally stunning!  and you look awesome!

I loved this outfit so much that I bought the top from Top Shop yesterday – thanks for the inspiration

 And what a wonderful new year’s eve indeed. Our night started with a lovely dinner at our hotel’s restaurant, The Zebra, and ended celebrating with the French under the Eiffel Tower and as far as I can tell they really know how to party:  Kissing, singing and lots lots of champagne. The people are crazy. Funky crazy. Vive la France.

Wearing my newest addition and long-time desire, Chanel’s Boy bag, fresh from Galeries Lafayette, Maje dress, of course the Gucci pumps and Isabel Marant fur.

Vanessa Seward denim/Celine top(via LuisaWorld)/Valentino bag/Gucci loafers/Tom Ford sunglasses.
Ph Haris Farsarakis
Emerging designers…does this category truly represent designers like Vanessa Seward, who has designed before for houses like Chanel, Azzaro and A.P.C. Atelier de Production et de Création (their latest collaboration actually carried her name)? And if your über consciousness says a big fat NO, then how would you describe an already established creator who only recently makes her own line?
Well sometimes categorizations are not that important than the collections themselves. Vanessa Seward is the designer that I’ve instantly fell in love while I’ve stumbled upon her in the pages of Harpers Bazaar US. She represents all I’ve aimed for and even more when I looked up my style heroines like Lauren Hutton. A nostalgic without feeling whimsical collection of refined, chic staples and denims from luxurious Japanese stretch cotton, denims which can actually get embroidered on their back with your first name in her own boutiques.
I really have to say this guys, Vanessa Seward is a pure heroine by herself and I promise you my (for now) one and only piece from her winter collection very soon will have…siblings…

You can find some of my favourite pieces of Vanessa Sewards’s recent collection below. Enjoy!

Wearing Diane von Furstenberg goat hair coat, 7 for all mankind grey denim, Etoile knit, Stuart Weitzman boots and crocodile clutch bought from Bangkok. And you could wonder how is it possible? Well it was scheduled to flight at six in the morning and even thought I knew eventually it would destroy my biological clock, my excitement didn’t leave me to sleep. Evidently after I reached Paris, early in the evening I’ve started wanting desperately to go to bed. This was happening perhaps the first time since my last trip to south-east Asia. And I did it guys, I’ve slept for 14 hours! I suppose my second day will be more active……



Hi! I am in Paris too!
Great blog & pics. I own a blog about wellies, & a bit thigh high boots in Paris & world. Check it & tell me if I can use one  of your pics  made Place Vendome in my blog!
Have a nice time in my town, & it’s not too cold!

Hi Arno, thank you for your kind words and ofcourse you can use my photos if my blog is mentioned. I’m checking your blog right away…

Michael Kors shirt/Marni skirt/Gucci loafers
Ph Haris Farsarakis
Fall’s statement skirts are first in almost every single alphabet and made for all the body shapes. Women I’ve found your doc! Joking…Statuesque or (maybe not) the iconic A-line high-waisted skirt is a shameless limb-elongator, almost one Marvel superhero. Sexy enough without feeling too obvious a perfect balance between strength and femininity. With A-line skirts, the lower part of the body stays in focus, positive focus, so I would suggest to avoid loud shout-outs from the upper part.

-Hey there, you above, STAY QUIET!

A simple masculine shirt or a plain sweater would make the perfect yet muted buddy. Maybe my favourite skirts of the upcoming season.

You can shop my best picks from A-line skirts below. Enjoy.

Tonight like another memory refresher, we’re going to celebrate this blog’s moto: “simplicity is the greatest ability” that is. You do remember it, no? And there is no better time than the present to write about how they all started…Well I was a little girl when…No, no, no, I’m joking. Let’s go again, It all began with my unconditional love for the simplest things. Here it is. That goose bump factor coming from the beauty of the complete effortless dressing. I just wanted the world to know that yes, the aforementioned X can exist even if it’s not surrounded by blingful sequins.

-Hmmmm, we thought that it was all an ode to black.

You know, you are a very, very devilish audience…:)

Such a beautiful and classic outfit. Really love that close up shot of your bag – gorgeous! xx

Valentino dress, Shanghai collection/ Valentino bag/Chanel boots

Photography Carin Olsson

You know what they say, “There’s a first time for everything.” Indeed my friends, despite having considered myself a red opponent for as long as I can remember, depending on my “homemade’ theory that my pale skin unfavorably reacts to anything flashier than it, during the dress fittings at the Valentino’s head-quarters, I fell in love with an alien that depicted red. Sock! First it was brown and now red! And then what? The evolution of change applicable to my own brain cells? Naaaaaaaa…as I’ve told you in a previous post, again, everything in life is about giving chances, be open-minded and realize the Valentino’s red is “the one and only red”.

A big thank you to the Valentino team who have made this Haute Couture week so special for me and honored me by watching live their absolutely heart pounding collection of craftmanship.
You can see my full report on Paris Haute Couture here.

This dress is fabulous! And you make it look even better. What a relief that you wore it with boots, not heels;) Really, stunning look.

You may not believe me, but (Valentino’s) red is definitely your color:)

I might believe you….hehehehe! Thank you darling <3

Perfect in this red dress, so gorgeous

Kiss kiss.*Jo

Evangelie, you look absolutely stunning. It must have been a dream to wear Valentino, the detail on the dress is exquisite. Red really does suit you, which is excellent news for aw14!!!

Hey angels! I’m back and I’ve told you that’s big. I mean the clutch you naughty girls…You see now? The photo is taken two hours before boarding. If you could look at my face closely you would see a real devastation. My kingdom was over. Nevermind now I’m home and ready to rock your world. Uhhhhhh. Ok, so these slouchy pants were a great savior for the trip. Loose enough for 11 hours sitting and vibrant coloured for energy boosting when the mood was at the limit down. And how succesful they were..No itching, no bloating. Trust me.

Wearing Acne pants, The Kooples top, Jimmy Choo trainers and 4×4 croc clutch.

I love your blog too….Super trainers!

Great post and love your blog! Thanks for stopping by and letting me know what I have been missing out on.

My kind of playground. Beauty and fun or with fun even better. Look at the third picture, you see what I mean? Two people straightening my hair and an iPad instead of magazines… Viva Thailand!

When travelling I love to wear something super stylish but extra comfy because I might start from breakfast and end to late cocktails. You know, lalala never ends.  Today it was time to join me, my Isabel Marant lace dress layered over a Topshop tank dress  with a Jimmy Choo handbag and trainers.

i love the electric blue in you!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

This is the second part of my daily maintenance‘s trilogy, and yes it will be a make-up post in the near future. So let me introduce you to my crazy hair’s world. It’s a frizzy, dry and damn curly world. In addition to this madness, my super sensitive scalp demands extra attention in choosing the right products or else I usually end up like a pimple machine.

1. GHD Styler. Straightening without destroying. I use this styler for more than 5 years and I really owe to this half of my hair’s length. It’s easy fast and creates the most incredible vamp waves.

2. Chi Air tourmaline brush. My daily touch-up for my extra frizzy/freakin roots. Pull, blow n’ready in just a few seconds.

3. MoroccanOil. I’ve discovered it two years prior in Chicago when a hairdresser introduced it like a “jesus in a jar”. And yes it is.

4. Apivita shampoos. They’re organic and they don’t irritate my sensitive scalp. Plus my hair loves them.

5. Schwarzkopf gliss hair repair, or the promise keeper. I use this mask instead of conditioner and I can really swear on this product.

6. Hippophaes seeds. The other half of my hair’s length is owed to these seeds. Many of you have noticed my locks’ rapid change and this is my little secret. I eat 10 of them every morning and I’ve seen a miraculous improvement in only two months.

ps. This is another honest post but don’t you ever forget that every single scalp is completely unique.

Are these seeds or dried berries? I can’t seem to find seeds anywhere, only berries. Thanks.

Ahhh i’m so sorry Monica…i find them in the local stores with exactly the name I’ve posted the link. But there are also supplements with it at the pharmacies..let me put a link that might help

Great dress 🙂
How is the sizing of this dress, by the way?
Which size are you wearing??? It looks better if wearing bigger than TTS, is not it?
Thank you for advice!

Hi Munny. I did the mistake and took it in size 38 instead of 36 that i usually wear. This dress is fantastic but after a use tends to get larger and longer. So don’t size up. You’ll regret it. Just wear it in the house and it’ll get bigger.

Hi! Thank you so much for your great & helpful advice!

AMAZING dress!!! (:

Valentino shirt/ Valentino bag/Cos denim
Ph Haris Farsarakis

It was until only recently, more specifically during the Fall-2015 shows, that Yves Saint Laurent’s very popular in the 60s pussy bow got revamped. Can you also hear the cheers of joy right from my neckline? YAS! Eveck* is popping up the champagnes. I really hated the not so-long-ago situation. There was TOO MUCH going on under my chin and not very flattering for my face, for everyone’s face if I may. Now that the thin delicate tie has succeeded the previous season’s almost brain-washing big fluffiness, the shape is more classically confident making you feel strong and safe in your own clothing. No more gift-warped silhouettes but a genuine simplicity underlying your natural beauty.

*hybrid:  Evangelie+neck
You can shop my picks of the thin-bow blouse below. Enjoy!

And the day begins by posting tsunami warnings: “not too chatty today”, “not too chatty”

Well go out, have a glass of wine somewhere, and come back and socialize you biatch…. did someone say!? I know you… Are you talking to me?

Let’s ignore the previous emotional press conference and continue with a tribute to my Far East exotic genes. Ok, ok it’s too obvious that I’m joking lying…but right now I really wish I would be lying under a blooming cherry blossom at Kyoto’s colorful gardens. Si, si, I have a great imagination…but no use for it.. And think about it, It was all started by a not so simple kimono vest and I traveled the world without ticket. What’s the brain!? 

Btw any vacation plans? Make my day….Do tell!

Jo No Fui dress/Avant Toi beanie/Celine shoes(similar here)/Saint Laurent bag(black, red, silver, croc)

ph Jordan Makarof

“When you apologize for doing something wrong, that’s an act of atonement.”

And who does really set the rules? I mean when wrong is universally bad, like killing, stealing, decrying, then it’s wrong and atonement is basically the catalyst for your salvation. To make YOU feel better. Because “wrong” is already done and you just can’t step back in time. Not until the time-machine is finally found at least.

 

-Why so serious?

Well you are definitely aware of the meaning of  “chain reaction”. It all started with that dress. The ethereal Jo No Fui dress. It kinda reminds me of my all time favorite piece, the “Atonement” gown. It’s Keira Knightley’s mind blowing green dress. Do you remember it now? Of course you do. Anyway with that vivid memory brought to mind, I realized that as a Greek native, I had never, ever searched for the actual meaning of the aforementioned movie’s title. So I did and that’s the least complicated that I’ve found, not involving God or religions. And then a whole day passed thinking of my lifetime story. The need to explain and apologize, as the only way of not feeling better but actually to bring out of people a better self. If there was. That changed. Completely.  Suddenly my life turned a corner and I’ve realised that you really don’t have to explain yourself. Misinterpretations do not exist. People will like you or dislike you, agree or disagree, perceive your behavior as good or bad,  for their own reasons,  whatever you do. You can’t change that. You have already a small spot in their life’s big plan and you don’t even know it. On the other hand think about your mother’s love. Do you always have to explain yourself or being apologetic for the misunderstandings? There’s not such thing. There are no misunderstandings. Because when true love exists respect and understanding take place of the pretty much useless words.  For all the rest you just shouldn’t care. Be good with yourself, cherish your soul with love and kindness and stay true to you beliefs. Then leave the universe to think what it want to think. That’s the way life goes.

Hey from Siem Reap! Here I am my globe trekkers as I promised, ready to travel you, in distant exotic places.

Behold my magnificent hotel. The elegant La Residence d’Angor , managed by Orient Express, only for super stylish travelers. It is located ideally close to my exploration target,  Angkor Wat, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a must see once in a lifetime. This breathtaking complex is the only one in the area that is built exclusively from wood and has the sweetest smiling staff I’ve ever met. Room bonus, a huge stone bathtub, ready to welcome your exploding feet after a series of attempts to pretend Angelina Jolie in Tomb Rider. Enjoy!









 





 



 

PS: Henri Bendel’s striped cosmetic cases are the best company to travel with! Trust me!

Well I have promised you to make a post about my favorite beauty products and you know a Pisces never forgets her… promises. I can’t speak for you but for me finding the right pimple resistants for my massively sensitive face was a real pain in the ass face. I have tested every single “miracle” shit in the market, yeap curiosity is my second nature, but only the below goodies are the best, the ultimate saviors for my previously depressed skin.

1. Clarisonic Mia. My daily cleansing regimen, the brush that I can’t live without.  It deeply cleans my pores, leaving my skin smooth and luminous. Tip: use only the sensitive head, you would clean your delicate skin and not your floors.

2. A-Derma Sensifluid. Liquid soap for super sensitive skin.

3. Sisley Crème Réparatriceau Beurre de Karité. Like Jesus in a jar. Life savior! Completely soothed and hydrated my pissed off and extremely burnt, after a laser session, skin.

4. Sisleÿa Eye and Lip Contour Cream. Bye bye crows’ feet! I use it from like forever so I can really swear on this product. It’s the best in the market!

5. Chanel UV Essentiel multi-protection daily care SPF 50 / PA+++. The one and only sunscreen that I wasn’t allergic… With everything else my face exploded. Terribly.

6. Supremÿa at Night. Ok it might cost you a Louboutin but it lasts forever plus you’ll have this morning glow that everyone suspects the reason but nobody really knows!

 

Remember this might be an honest review however every skin has different needs and testing samples is really, absolutely crucial.

HI Evangelie!!Latreuw ola ta post pou anevazeis,,ena me makeup would be a great idea..Im in my late thirties and i just hate my skin at the moment..Never before in my life did i have so many tiny pimples,,redness,sensitivity.When i was in Greece i tried many products from pharmacies,like Avene,vichy,,ok,,so,so..Now ,i moved to Toronto and i dont know where to start!Every day my face has a couple of pimples and is very sensitive,,i really am confused..What do you suggest?When you had the problems did you go to a dermatologist or sorted out by yourself??Thanks a million!!!

Love, Roula

That morning glow thing sounds really tempting, so I definitely wanna try Supremÿa. At what age did you start using it? Is it OK to use if you’re under 30?

I guess the earlier you’ll start the better for you…but try a sample first to see if it works for you
xo

I want to try number 1. Sounds like a great plan for a lovely skin

XO Charlotte

Thanks for the post, I had never considered getting one of those cleansing brushes as I never think they will do anything – but now I may need to reconsider, have a great weekend! Kate x

Wearing Iro Agnette Red distressed jacket and top, Jerome Dreyfuss Bobi bag. The bracelets are Philippe Audibert.

Leaning towards spring, in my case only mentally, the pictured destroyed tweed jacket is the frivolous colorful evolution of my previous badass one.

Destruction never sounded better, don’t you think?

Loved the jacket but especially the bracelets! 🙂

Lau

LOVE that Jacket!  I have it in ecru…so perfect!

I have ordered a few of IRO’s jackets for the new season…so excited…they design the best.  I have one from a couple of seasons ago, the silver sequin one…probably one of the best sequin jackets I’ve seen!

The red is beautiful…love the blog:)

Wearing Zara/Trf (spring collection) tweed jacket, Etoile Isabel Marant tank, Chanel Boy Bag, Ileana Makri serpent ring.

Destruction hit tweeds, instantly twisting their preppyness into a surprisingly badass chicness. You see destruction isn’t always for bad and believe me girls, your denim couldn’t be more enthusiased by this latest trend.

Can I ask an advise?
I bought this jacket from Zara, but I am wondering if I should return as  it leaves black & white treads all over your other clothing.
Any suggestions and I would be ever grateful.

Thanks girls.

Hi Hanne, I don’t have any problem with mine…perhaps you should ask for a replacement..xo

Great idea – mine is flossing all over 🙂

Love it!!!

Blame it on the freezing weather but I had to, I really had to, protect myself inside the warmth of the French capital’s shops. The fact that I’ve grabbed some delicious eye candies( stay tuned) wasn’t on purpose. It was just a random coincidence. You know that I’m telling the truth, don’t you?

I feel it's safe to say, swimwear are amazing when they make you feel so confident like you were dressed up into the chicest outfit. That realizations and even more came to my brain cells after a week with Marysia, or else my bomb Maldivian attires. To make a long story short when you still feel great after exposing your body to your worst enemy, the camera, well that's a hell of swimwear.

Marysia Palm Springs Bikini

If I've had these extra, future-telling powers and my fortune sphere did operate well, then I would say that these slides from The Row would be the hit of the summer that everybody will want but nobody will find since they will sell-out. However I am not a witch...or am I?

The Row Capri Metallic Slides

To be completely honest is not our original idea as we firstly saw it on YSL's most recent catwalk. And it's no secret that our biggest source of inspiration are the catwalks. So stack up your earrings people no matter their size. Actually the bigger, the better. :)

Our favorite Aussie did it again with her recently launched denim line that got us falling in love all over with the statement jeans, or else the pieces which get you dressy in no time. My current obsession the Monroe, the middle one, the high-rise slim to die for.

Even thought Jeff instructions were specific “Do not Photoshop a thing”(yes the latest posts’ images are exactly as they’re born from their Daddy’s camera), I’m here to plead guilty and beg for forgiveness…

-I’m so sorry Jeff but I’ve photoshopped my…crotch!

Although I deeply love these pants after some times of use, they massively slouch to add to my figure some really masculine features(pipi)…Liquify and back in the game because in real life I’m clueless if there actually is a solution. Wash them every day?Pffffff….

Enough with filling your pretty heads with my own sartorial issues and let’s talk about good stuff and these are no other than sales and they are major! Have you already checked the Net-A-Porter’s vavavoom ones? What you have?! But of course. And what was been the first thing added to your wish list? And I don’t know about you but I, since I am a shoe-girl and since the winter has already showed its claws, I’ve been eyeing a few of the over-the-knee boots, my latest fetish as it seems. And because I love and I know how to share, you can find below some of my favorite ones. Enjoy.

Wearing River Island pants, currently sold out but check here in case of restocking, Boutique vest, Nowhere Peek shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, Isabel Marant biker jacket.

Hey style heroines. It was one of these days that I had no idea what to talk about, besides turning your Saturday nights to less formal and more rebel-chic, but  it seemed too obvious and you are too fashion aware for such ridiculous lessons. But after minutes of pointlessly staring my image the light bulb flashed, exposing the greatest trick in the leg elongation history. Stripes. He he he. Do my legs look longer? Negative answers are forbidden in this blog. Sure I’m not a magician but vertically speaking, these rolled pants have virtually added a couple of leggy inches to my whole figure. Don’t get  too excited Gisele’s assets are far, far away but such flattering yet awesome pieces are a rocking start.

Ps. These pants were brought from far, far away. They’re Chrisa’s gift from Singapore! Love love love you Chris, they’re awesome. THANK YOU!

omg i cant even deal!! you’re stunning girrl! LOVE your style!

Yeah the best shoes from Kling’s collection. The trick succeeded, greeeeeat pants!Φιλί:)

Wow, i was thinking about buying those pants too- so Balmain! 🙂

The perfect pair of Nowhere pumps, check, striped denim, check, amazing IM leather jacket, check, coolest girl around town, check check 😉 

Love this! Thanks for the perfect weekend inspiration.

Hey, hey my blogpals. Have you missed me? Naaaaa, I know Paris couture week hasn’t left even one spare moment to think about your little style heroine. What? Delo Russo’s lenses blinded you? Well I didn’t know you’re that good in making excuses. So the last three days I took some time off from everything just to clear up my mind a little bit and recharge my batteries. Oh yeah I have full bars now. Beware of overloading.

The depicting darkness in my photos is just an attempt to catch the moment before our night walk, sporting my new sparkling Barbarella skirt. Like? Tell…I’ve missed your cyber voices..

Babe! I never saw this post. The photos and look are so amazing!

Thank you sweetie…

You lucky little monsters, one of my favorite leather dresses in the fashion universe is currently on sale. I’ll be honest with you. It’s not the piece that you’ll fall in love  from the first sight. It’s pretty boxy and surely not the common eye attractor when hanged,  but the moment your natural curiosity persuades you to try it on,  you’ll understand that premature judgment often sucks.

It’s from our loving French, Isabel Marant and you can find it here.

Love this.

They say never going back yet sometimes it's really nice to look in the past to decide for the future. And what have I seen from my very own and very recent past? Oh gosh so many hairstyles. I'm joking, 2016 has been full of color, quite different for my usual style don't you think? As for the future of my locks? Destiny unknown.

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to you all from you little puffy (and of course white) snowflake. Big kiss. E

I really love going out by wearing only a stand-out lipstick. And by stand-out I mean a deep powerful shade, a lipstick that stays on the lips and doesn't move around (to your teeth etc). For this season my very favorite shades are from Chanel Rouge Allure Ink. They are super, super long lasting, matte but not dry. Depicted you can see my personal loves but also shades that I believe they match with every single skin. Enjoy.

My exotic purchase from Bangkok. This huge oversized clutch was love at first sight and bought from the city’s high-end 4×4 men’s store. You never know what hidden treasures you could find in the opposite sex’s boutiques. Be always open-minded!

OMG!! This is an amazing piece!!! Im headed to Bangkok, do you remember the store you found this at? Or where I could find a similar piece?
Thanks so much!!!

Hi, the store is named 4×4 men and is located at the central mall. It is a men’s store but it has the most amazing clutches ever!Good luck!!!!!

 Acne leather pants, size 34/ Balenciaga shirt, size 36(still available at Balenciaga Athens)/Jimmy Choo trainers(true to size)/ Jimmy Choo bag

Ph Jordan Makarof

Editing by me.

And it’s a wrap. Yet the guest STARS of the Jimmy Choo editorials were definitely not my constallation-ed soles BUT the adopted-for-the-day honey-haired sweetest creature on earth. The living proof that dogs can seat still, a thing that I do tend to forget living the Beagle life.

Ayla….dear….you are not a good girl…look how other doggies behave….and stop bitting my toes…pfffffff

You can see my entire editorial for Jimmy Choo Stylemakers here.

I am obsessed with your scarf! OMG!

Please check out my posts if you have a free moment!

http://www.thefashionpanda.be

slightly off topic but…
i’m catching up a pile of sunday NY Times (mostly the sunday styles section!) and i’m about 99% sure there’s a shot of you at paris fashion week in Bill Cunningham’s ‘on the street’ weekly section!  you’re wearing a black mesh sleeved saint laurent dress and ann d. combat boots…stunning!  and i’m super jealous–i’ve not-so-secretly always hoped i’d open the sunday papers one day and see myself in bill’s column!  

in case i’m not repeating old news and you didn’t catch it, it’s the october 27th paper (yes, i’m pathetically that far behind in newspaper reading…i don’t even bother with the actual news sections at this point!)

and back to this blogpost…love it!  classic white button down, leather trousers and cool-as-heck trainers??  perfection!

(ps. the dog is added bonus! :))

Omg I have never seen it! How can I find this pic? Do you have an idea? :))))
xoxoxoxo

et voila! does this link work?:

http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2013/10/27/fashion/27STREET.html?ref=fashion

i think that’s you in the shot right below the written text in the center!

Yes it works and yes it’s me :)))
Thank you my love❤️

anytime!  

a family friend was randomly photographed by cunningham years ago (wearing a pucci dress and crossing 5th ave in nyc!)–she had the newspaper page framed and hung it in her bathroom! so cool…you should totally frame it too–bill c. is the original sartorialist in my book! 🙂

Awesome outfit!
And the dog is too cute.

Boots, denim & t-shirt Saint laurent/ headscarf Acne

Photos by Jordan Makarof.

“Airheads” propel prepare yourselves. It’s major and you’ll see it coming. Don’t ever tell me that I haven’t alerted you. I’ve even used awareness posters of myself to do so….
Well my big, proud, forehead is particularly happy for that tiny, little adjustment. Not that its nuclear physics nor a crazy stroke of genius. Just the pair of my scarf’s ends, shamelessly popping out of my midforehead knot, et voila. I’ve been propelled. I simply, endlessly love it.

the scarf is perfect!!

Editing by me.

It’s almost Saturday and my week with Jimmy Choo slooooowly comes to an end. As a matter of fact we have one more to go. And this time I won’t be alone. I’ll be accompanied by someone hairier than me. Yeap you heard well, before technology had been hit Athens and the dearest laser torched my mammal fur, I was the distant cousin of Slash. Now everything goes smoother, I have moved out to the Bald Mountain and I have happily embraced the naked side of life. Oh, how intimate is too intimate?

You can see my entire editorial for Jimmy Choo Stylemakers herest.

Did you get to choose which pair of shoes you want to showcase?  If so, I love your pick on this one pair in particular.  I am a sucker for loafers.  This pair is just about being perfect.  And your mile-long legs are perfect to showcase the loafers.  🙂

Aww thank you Serena. Yes i have chosen everything by myself. And these ones are sooo comfy:))

Hey my favorite people in the world! I’m continuing experiencing problems with my sleep as my photos clearly indicate. Well, my eyes are so swollen that any remedies you might know could be useful. And when I say any I mean it. Besides this irritating phenomenon everything else is rolling hyperly. Take a sneak peek of today’s magic tour of Bangkok’s mysterious temples…Geia!

Wearing an extra easy silky H&M shirt-dress with beautiful patterns, my Dannijo necklace, and Alexander Wang shoes and handbag.

I loveeeee this!!! 

I never have any luck at hm! I love the shirt dress! Any tips on how to shop at hm? It’s so big and a lot of times messy/cluttered — makes me not want to shop there! Thank you!

The necklace is beautiful!

Love your blog btw.

Hi Kathy,
I know what you mean but I really don’t have any tips for H&M except from patience cause sometimes you can find real gems there…..
xo

you look so perfect lavvvvvvvvvv!!!!!!!!

You look like out of a magazine, hope you have a good time 🙂

i can t believe it, that this silky shirt-dress is from H&M! by the way your hair looks really good!!!

You look fantastic…. Go girl…

You look great, enjoy your trip…xxx

beautiful pictures!!!!!!!HAVE FUN BABY!!!!!!  จูบ!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thank you for my amazing three days. 

It’s 6 in the morning here and I’m heading quickly for the breakfast because I have a flight to catch, and you know, hungry bear doesn’t dance.. . I’m leaving my friends for a pure exotic destination. I have chosen to wear a quite loose dress from Surface To Air, my Louboutin sandals and a Hermes scarf to hold back all the possibilities to catch a cold from the mean air-conditioning in the airport. You’ll have my news during the day. Love u!

Everything looks perfect!Have fun and relax…

Your photos are beautiful, keep up the good work…

In early December I've had the pleasure to visit one of Berlin's historic post-war buildings and world's first concept mall, an incredible space overlooking the German capital's zoo. If you are around go there and see the awesome Christmas installment by Stills and Strokes, one more great art addition to this space's brilliance.

"Clever" which is actually clever because on this space one quote that we love much is the epic "Look MA no hands". The belt-bags from Vanessa Seward are this winter's eye candies and the easiest goodies-keepers you'll ever have. I personally love to wear them super high over jumpsuits. Easy n'cool.

I've been to a places I couldn't possibly imagine, I've felt emotions that I can't even describe. India is beyond everything I've ever seen. Thank you Jimmy Choo for making me part of your digital campaign for the second year.

Wearing Maje sweater, COS denim, YSL pumps, Celine bag, Givenchy cuff.

My style heroines have spoken.

Some of you like my hair just the way they are, while others want a new improved version of me with longer, lighter locks. Well my dearest friends after consuming half of my brain juice I’ve decided that I lean towards the second opinion because as Nat has commented, this could really upgrade me into “looking rad as usual babes“, yeah and if that isn’t an ultimate target, then what it is?

Any hair growth vitamins suggestions?;-)

I think you look gorgeous! I’ve been on a mission to find good vitamins for hair growth as well. Ive heard that all forms of Vitamin B can help as well as Biotin.

Photos by Jordan Makarof.

her·o·ine:
1. a woman possessing heroic qualities
2. a woman idealized for possessing superior qualities
3. the main female character in a novel, play, film, etc

My reality cloud can finally live up to the fantasy of my insane blog-name. Behold what you’ve all been waiting for, the real heroine’s legs, totally strapped in the depicted I-could-definitely-kick-your-ass sandals, a fierce Tron girl as a male friend denoted. Men do know best….no?

Oh my! Finally found the origin of this photo haha. I feel like it’s been floating around on Pinterest/Tumblr for a while but I never know whose it was. (Sorry about the comment spamming…I’m just really enjoying all your outfits!! <3 )

Wearing Curved T-shirt By Boutique, Isabel Marant fringed pants, Alexander Wang Ashley boots, Topshop ring and bracelets. The python oversized clutch is handmade.

Everyone full moon stricken, please raise your hand. What? All? Hmmmm…

Fringed to perfection, these playful leggings were my ultimate antidote to the stereotypical dressy Friday night aesthetic. And when my famous cha-cha moves  have started  shaking the frivolous fringes…  was a pure visual extravaganza on the burning dance-floor! POW!




RAD pants!

 Wearing Mikkat Market skirt, LNA tee, Pierre Hardy sandals, Chanel Boy Bag, Cooee rings, Ileana Makri snake necklace.

And while your nasty minds have definitely connected the tittle with something spicy, I’ll rather bring you back to the harsh blogality* by informing you that I was only referring to the shape of my skirt… Come on don’t you see it? It’s an X! But not a common X. A sexy, featherish, delicate, refined X. You can tell, I just love that skirt.

* hybrid from blog-reality

fantastic look! I’m always hesitating wether or not to order something from Mikkat Market, not knowing their sizing etc, but you make me want to do it again!

Wearing Isabel Marant knee-high boots and stripped pants(s/s 2010), Topshop denim shirt(find a similar here), Jimmy Choo clutch(s/s 2011).

Trying to figure out how to obtain the perfect spring boots without spending not even a single dollar, I’ve had the best “eureka” moment ever. I’ve just rolled down my IM knee-high boots et voila…my new rocking booties. Blame it on the royal jelly that I’m consistently taking the past few days (after my recent memory black-out), and my brain cells seem to function properly at last. Tell me, tell me, aren’t you proud of me? You can also do it. All you need is a pair of soft leather boots. It’s such a fun.

Cute photos!!
Love the outfit and the blog!!

You've asked I listen...so on "Do it like E" posts we apply my favorite and super easy beauty tricks on different persons. Let's get started people with triangles. I'm always super lazy with my make-up and I have invented this way of going out wearing ONLY eyeliner and looking fresh. I just draw a small triangle ending exactly at the middle part of my lash line. That's it. It uplifts my eyes(and the whole face) making it look fresh n' sexy in no-time. Just remember to use the most stable eyeliner to avoid transferring to your upper eyelid. My favorite Calligraphie De Chanel n. 65 hyperblack. The best.

When party season is on, usually the back-side goes off. Who doesn't love an open-back top with the chicest spaghetti straps for the festive season? If it's accompanied by a generous dose of sequins like the Altuzarra's mermaid-y one even better. Let the music play people!

Hey from Bangkok! How are you guys? I’m good but also tired from a terrible jet lag so I’m gonna be quick. We arrived early in the morning after 11 hours of flight and I’m really sleepless for about two days. The hotel is jaw dropping. We’re staying at the Four Seasons and even thought it’s located in the heart of the town, you have the feeling that you are in a summer palace in the country side. Our day was nothing more than exploring the area around it and the huge shopping malls. By the way I’ve noticed that all the European brands are priced about 30% higher than in Greece. Are they nuts?Pfff… the perfect rehab for a shopaholic!

PS. The Chanel biker boots rock!

Wearing Isabel Marant tweed jacket, James Perse dress, Alexander Wang shoes and handbag.

Enjoy your trip !! By the way channel boots very very nice

Have a great time…..:-)

Gucci wool-felt coat/Uniqlo sweatrer/Uniqlo denim/Miu Miu booties/Gucci bag.
Ph Jeff Thibodeau

And just at the moment when I’ve started to feel at ease with my newly found under-my-umbrella reality, well it was about time to return. Is it always like that? When you’re just getting used to something, at this very point,  do you always have to let it go?! So I left back my umbrella, actually it was Jeff’s oh-so-stylish protector, yet I brought back my coat, a very favorite one, a piece that everybody should own per me. I know that there are some girls who might not look at their best when they wear tailored pieces but my body-type absolute adores them. Honestly if  I had to choose only one coat for this season, it would be it and even If I had to take only one to the Big Apple, it would be still it.

-So much love?

Stop being judgemental and just imagine it over a wool dress or a denim shirt if you live in the very-sunny-lately Greece. So actually yes, so much love….





Beautiful style!

Ohmygod your new layout, these images I DIE!! So amazing, go gurrl!

This just became my favorite post of all time! Sometimes it’s hard figuring out what to wear on a rainy day but I must admit you nailed it! Those white pants seal the deal.

Etoile Isabel Marant top, size 38(similar here in light blue and white) /Valentino bermudas, size 4(similar in white and black)/Jimmy Choo Mystic pumps(true to size)/ Jimmy Choo Chill bag

Ph Jordan Makarof

Photo editing by me.

You how it goes, fourth day happily ever feet-ed. What you probably don’t know is that every single year, for all of its 365 days I’m obsessed with one thing in my wardrobe, which my brain cells have already matched it with my entire closet. Last year were my Ann D. combat boots, two years ago my Anine bing black shirt and now the depicted Isabel Marant top. When I’ll reach to the point of layering it over my knits in winter then my condition will be serious.

You can see my entire editorial for Jimmy Choo Stylemakers here.

Great outfit!

 Wearing Isabel Marant Texas dress(in black, grey, coral, blue) and mesh dress, Alaia sandals, custom-made necklace.
When a fatal dilemma forces you to choose between an Isabel Marant super short panty flasher and a divorce paper, use my eureka moment and just layer the “devil” above a longer simple mesh dress. It looks great and definitely saves your marriage.

I want it all I want it now!!And I mean of course the outfit!! LOVE it!

This is the best dress from Isabel Marant, and I didn’t even know it… Now I can’t find it anywhere in my size.. If you come across one, please let me know!

XO Charlotte

What’s your size baby???

Coat Carven(and here)/shorts Carven/shirt Zara/pumps Valentino
The photo shoot took place in the Island Private House.

ph Jordan Makarof

My rain dance has worked at last! The god of rain has just visited Athens with his massive thunderbolt in hand and I have finally stopped been grumpy for no reason the prolonged summer heat wave. Trust me, It was getting really weird. More specifically aliens-invaded-earth-heated-up-the-core-and-suddenly-all-humans-melted-from-microwaves weird. Anyway… In this wholly wetphoria* situation,  I….. feel drowsy. Honestly guys if you want to make me sleep in no-time, let me listen the rain sound(even audio) or a hairdryer! Actually the second one is the shameful reason of my never-ending inappropriate like a horse sleep when in hair salons.

-Hmmm…..we always knew that you’re kind of problematic!

Well, I think it’s a (not-so) sweet residual from childhood, when my mom has been giving me a bath every single night, just before bedtime. And boy how much I hated that bathtime. It was a nightmare!  No, no don’t worry. I’m not still an adamant water hater. Some things have drastically changed. You can certainly approach me.

Oh boy, I’ve been lusting after this precious blue Yves Saint Laurent large clutch for a long, long time. And here it is, fresh and frivolous relaxing on my coffee table, preparing for its long summer ride. Isn’t it fantastic?

How many love letters have you sent to the darest of all Santas? For me it's been always shoe-letters, dear Santa point-toe this, sky-heel that. This year he visited me early with the coolest satin sparklers. Kitten heels to die-for from J.W Anderson. 

Waking up to thousands of green parrots flying over your majestic colonial villa, walking through the exotic gardens next to your regular friends, the peacocks, emptying your mind around the 18th century Shiva temple, every of the meals...a treat, the service beyond of everything you've ever experienced, making you feel like you're home. If there's heaven, I guess I've already found it. Special thanks to the real gem of Rajvilas, the manager Mr Abhishek, the most attentive person I've ever met and the Jimmy Choo team that has made my stay out of this world. 

Calvins....except from the word kings, what else does it come to mind? Well to mine, it's definitely the fact that they are the ONLY underwear you are allowed to flash and still look cool, the Coolest if I may. And that comes from a person that has never before showed her undies to the public yet still feels sooooo good! Only in my Calvins.

I've got it in Paris and I wore it with from hot pants, to skinny jeans, to slip-dresses, non-stop. Not to mention that it is surprisingly warm. Honestly one of the best buys of the season. Fashion|Evangelie Smyrniotaki, Photography| Haris Farsarakis

  Wearing Isabel Marant shirt (check it out in denim here) and the same designer’s belt, Zara shorts (similar here), Acne sandals, Celine bag, RayBan sunglasses, Ileana Makri snake necklace.

Like the previous close-up post, I continue the know-me-better thematic marathon, introducing you this time to one of my most precious hobbies. Home decorating. Oh yes, apart from myself I also love decorating the worlds I live in. Peep some details of my country house, in fact it’s a guesthouse by my parents’ house, that I’ve designed and decorated about 9 years ago, really young, with all the free time in the world. If you like what you see and want some more, I’m going back for the weekend so just ask for it and your magic genie will just do it.

don’t tell me that’s your house! So beautiful! that’s where you should always take pictures!!!!

Oh, btw, Ev, I ‘m so curious : which part of Greece is your country house situated?

Still awaiting moderation on my post? Why, oh, why?

You always make my day!!! Handsome decor, one-to-remember outfit & styling!!! You’re my style heroine!!!

Celine loafers/Chanel bag/ Current Elliott shorts/Miu Miu top(available at LuisaWorld)/Tom Wood rings.
Photos by Jordan Makarof

Today it’s all about pirouetting around the park in an ensemble that totally depicts my currently contradicting emotional state of mind. Winter in the upper east side, summer in the lower. The denim, in another voice of logic, balances the cuckoo situation by shooting: Keep calm, vacations are coming…Take me with you! If I won’t take my beloved denim with me then what in the world…

Who said that clothes don’t talk?

 

 

NIce pictures!

Remarkably elegant and inadvertently non chalant at the same time! Extra plus: the set of images brings to mind all my favorite God Is An Astronaut songs.

amazing!!!

Pack your denim bags.. with your denim looks!
You look fab!

Dior pumps(similar here)/Friend Of Mine leather pants/Tom Wood rings/Chloe top(and in white)/Saint Laurent Betty bag (via LuisaWorld)
Photos by Jordan Makarof.

Well….asuming by the title(and certainly by the breathtaking background) you’d expect a major hystory-inspired Athens post. It could be but it isn’t. My shameless intention is clear: To speak about the humble classic black pump. Believe it or not, before going to Paris last month I didn’t have such a staple. Ha! All my black pumps had mates. Straps, metallic heels, patent details, whatever. They were all mated. So when in City of Lights with yet another series of frivolous pants, finding a pair of them became a life-threating necessity. But the most important thing that I didn’t really know was that simple black pumps are as rare as Megalosaurus tooth. Prehistoric truth yet truth. Three days, five arrondissements. Luck? Zero. The town was too romantic and coupling with bows and blings seemed inevitable. Not to mention the patent dominance. I didn’t want being mirrored on my shoes. Done it before. Anyways at the time I had grown tired of the chase of the scarce basics, I’ve entered the Dior boutique. By the way I’ve never met such wonderful and polite sales persons in my entire life. Unlike most, not only they understood what I was looking for, they also found it in another store(my puffed feet could only fit in the massive 41.5) and delivered within 10 minutes.  Finally a timeless pair of shoes that could proudly be inherited to my female descendants. Yes I will have,eventually, mom. What’s the rush?


so glad my mum is not the only mum with these thoughts for her daughter right now – enough mums!  one day…
love the shirt and totally agree about the black pump – there was a pair in zara last year I wish I bought because I haven’t seen another since!

Thankfifi

LOVE the leather pants!!
Do they run true to size?  Are they designed to be a bit loose?  I’m a US 6 and wondering if I should size up. Did you?

Gorgeous!!!

Hi Yvonne,
They’re designed to fit loose on hips. I wear 6 Australian size but I don’t know with what American equivalent is. I usually wear an Am size 2.

Hi Evangeline, I L-O-V-E your Friend of Mine pants. May I know what size you wear in it? It runs super small and even AUS 6 was too small for me (I’m a jean size 25-26) but sadly the larger sizes are sold out everywhere. Where did you get it and would you happen to know who still stocks it? thanks alot love.

Hi Chris ❤
So I’ve got them in size 6 from shopbop but they’re sold out there. I think that the fit is perfect and we’re the same size in jeans. Have you tried to send an email at the friend of mine site?

Wearing Zara/Trf sweatpants, Acne top, DVF goat fur, Gucci pumps and my Jerome Dreyfuss bag.

Hairo, hairo, hairo..How was your weekend style heroines? Anything special? Have you seduced the crowds or you’ve left this for the next one? Last night I’ve had a fabulous dinner/dancing with my friends, which always equals with a lot, lot of fun.

But to divert your attention back to this post’s purpose, I’d like to confess that the only hair that I love in the above picture is my coat’s goat hair. Honestly since I’ve changed mine just before shooting for StyleBy, I’m conflicted among which of the one I hate most: The cut or the colour? And as it happens here comes the great contribution of friendship. Advising! So…any suggestions? Do I need a new haircut or new colour or just leave them longer? The decision is yours. I’ll do it!

 

So Christine Centenera style!  😉

Much love from Italy ..

Your fur is amazing !

wow, this outfit looks amazing! love every single bit of it! <3

love from vienna,
xx mika

babe, you are stunning. like your pose and that you managed to add sexyness to sweatpants!

Love Vienna Wedekind

Ok well your hair is pretty much perfect: dark, healthy, shiny, long & straight! What more can I girl wish for? Personally, I love bangs but I am also the first one to get sick of them after a while. If it was a rule, i would say bangs are a 6 month thing, not longer, after you look boring and I know it from experience, also from friends who I would HONESTLY wish they would let it grow! If you check all the top fashionista’s they’ve all had the fringe, then let it grow so I say let it grow! As for the color, maybe a bit lighter since spring is around the corner, but honestly I love the color so I wouldn’t change it 😉

Love the casual chic style!

Happy Thanksgiving everyone. We are so grateful to our beloved ones and to y'all people for supporting us and for making our old dreams come true. Our favorite designers and blings are of course on the thankful-for list.

I guess you don't want everyone to have the same heels as you during the Holiday season, do you? Switch them around with the variations that are killing it for this season. Black satin sparkler, precious metallics or amber suedes. One for each day.

Wearing Isabel Marant Pepito jeans, IRO perforated leather top and bag(F/W 13), Celine shoes (similar here), H.Stern earings. The chain necklace is custom-made.

The long complicated season eventually comes to an end with our blurry bottoms(aka tie-dyes) cheerfully salute us, just a couple of months before immigrating to another planet. No, no, no, please don’t get confused, I’m not a hater, on the contrary, but I think that this season’s greatest trend has been circulated so much that the overdose is inevitable. Well the “Pepito “ones are the most badass version of Marant’s hit series, you know a little more baggy, a little more low waisted. Something like good girl gone bad.

Ps. Below is a gesture to know me a little better after a blogging year, my first close-up, that’s soooo close that if you approach the screen we can literally touch our noses. Don’t try this at home.

 

Hey gal!

You look great!  Love the outfit once again.

You look absolutely stunning! Love your make up!
Very chic outfit, love the shoes and jeans!

Think early mornings at Taj Mahal, think afternoon tea by Oberoi's swimming pool, think late dinner under the moonlight, this gorgeous Nina Ricci dress, cracked all the dressing codes and got me from day to night.  With a pair of Jimmy Choo slides or sky high sandals this dress is just perfect.

It might look like a muted shade but omg, trust me, wear this and you'll look anything but pale.  You'll radiate, good mood, retro mood.

Finding new designers to love is one of the most inspiring parts of my job. I'm currently obsessing over Benedetta Bruzziches for the best of the best leathers she is using for her bags as well for her exceptional designs, with my favorite this one, the dreamy half-moon.

So I did,  I overdid. Thus please ignore my resemblance with a feathered atlantic shrimp but isn’t it summer’s most glorious skirt. Common..do tell.

Cute skirt!

Wearing Stella McCartney jumpsuit, Isabel Marant blazer, Prada pumps, Chanel Boy Bag.

Does the tittle ring a bell to you? Come-on( my little contribution for this Friday night).

So in a world made of steel made of stone or like my tweet friend Lena says in “our recent fashion deprived lives” there is so much space for colour. Blinding colour, a naughty fuchsia, a tropical yellow or even a heavenly blue. 

Either way there must be always a part of your wardobe filled with these mood changers, prefering them minimalistic and sexy or girlie and frivolous this is up to your aesthetic but remember colour is your best and many times your only ally to fight against the misery.

Love you and thank you for keeping me the best company in the world.

Ev.

I love that Blazer!

Don’t you even think call these shorts tie-dye AGAIN. In fact if I  hear this word one more time I’m really gonna DIE. Let’s say they’re just complicated. Doesn’t it sound better?  Trust me the next season tit will get banned. Permanently. Fashion exception.

And I’m leaving you with a promise: Tomorrow I’ll be more chatty..

Goodnight babes…

Great outfit, love the top

I love this outfit and your photos so much, that I haven’t been able to get if off my mind since you posted it!  I finally broke down and bought the shorts and tee shirt.  I pray they look as lovely on me as they do on you!  Gorgeous!!

Amazing outfit!

Hej!

Yeap from multicultural to multilingual! What more does a blog can offer folks? Common! Do tell!
-Multidimensional maybe?
-Yeap…in another universe! For now I’m live blogging from Stockholm, actually from my softest bed zone, after a fruitful/awesome day in the Swedish Capital. It is my first visit to this amazingly beautiful city and its only for work. No vacay. A new day has home for this blog, aawaaaa (Celine-Dion-stolen), but per usual I can’t say much. Actually this time my tongue is also tied by a confidentiality agreement so…nobody wants to put Ev on jail….don’t you?. Patience my favorite human beings…after all isn’t that the greatest ability?(after simplicity of course). I know this blog is getting no sense…
-Weirdo…

Btw that coat saved my life on a frozen Scandinavian day…isn’t it something special?

I absolutely love that coat, so beautiful on those leather pants

Wearing Isabel Marant blazer, vintage belt, H&M PU pants.

Hey catwalkers. Today’s trend is a new perspective on sporting your classic blazer. Unfold it’s lapels! No, no, I’m not shouting, I’m just thrilled with this super cool take on our wardrobe’s staple. The process is ridiculously easy. Channel your inner Hugh, turn up your collar, wrap a leather belt around you waist and behold the glorious hybrid blazer-robe. If the belt doesn’t speak to your aesthetic, leave it loose and boxy. At the end I guess it’s only the attitude that matters. Right? Right!

Thanx for the tip! By the way, what kind of work do you do??

xoxo

Love the H&M pants. I seriously need a good leather legging and cannot find a good affordable pair for the life of me.

I have that same  wool blazer from I.M and I’m wondering if you sometimes while wearing it feel like you look
like a amazon/wrestler type woman????

I know I do – but on the other hand I think it looks smashing on everyone else….typical 😉

xoxo sigi

I know what you mean… it’s too boxy even for me but with a belt around the waist looks nicer!

Top Carven/skirt Carven(here and here)/Saint Laurent booties

Ph Jordan Makarof

The photo shoot took place in the Island Private House.

-Does Bambi have antlers?

-Well, I’m the adult version….I guess I’ve grown up.

-Any other questions?

-Me, me! How many spots does Bambi have?

-Shit…wrong questions lead to even wronger…questions.

So today, in this cure-to-printophobia outfit, I’m stepping out of the bushes in the crowd with the universal reassurance that “if I can do it then everybody can”. If you only think that in my not-so-long-ago past, the cutest spots of a fawn would bias been traced on the half part of an ala Givenchy sweatshirt, then a wholly animal print look is a great, great improvement surprise….

 

I love the last photo! The bambi color and print looks stunning with your tanned skin. Yeah, pretty damn great look.

Isabel Marant Maple dress(and here)/Saint Laurent booties/American Apparel bra/Chanel bag

Photos by Jordan Makarof

*Cheers to Isabel Marant, who’s double-scoring the impossible me:

Dress like a girl.

Dress like drunken raid on Hawaiian Sea World

Though it hasn’t been stated I’m positive that Mrs Marant is the  living descendant of  Dracula, the Great. First she “glamours” us into obeying her every single craziness and then she bloodsucks our pockets… 

Only you can make it happen….

 

 

 

 

 

wow you look fabulous!

Wow just discovered your blog and it’s absolutely amazing. Great outfit, wonderful photos. I’m in love.

Weather forecast: The temperature slowly starts to drop from tomorrow, urging for something light-weight to cover up especially at night.  And what’s lighter than a knit full of air-conditioning holes? Hah! The easy breezy fall’s first cotton jumpers are perfect for this season, because you know, if you’ll start wearing(at this side of the world) leather jackets, in the winter you’ll need a real polar bear.

Wearing H&M knit and skirt, Isabel Marant shirt, Thomas Wylde clutch, Miu Miu pumps.

AM IN LOVE WITH  THE WAY U  USE THE CHIEPEST  SKIRT WITH THE MOST EXPENSIVE  SHIRT AND U MAKE THEM  LOOK SO SUPER EVEN OPPOSITE ON  U!!!!!U HAVE THE CHARISMA KEEP ON THE GOOD WORK !!!!

love the skirt, love the clutch, love the girl!!!!mouts mouts ante come back and lets go out!!

I got the same jumper in black and I have to say it was a “life saver” in the already cold Scandinavian weather… Plus it goes with everything!

so out of the ordinary, plus that it gives a sense of “i was out all night”.

love it!

Hey loves! Tuesday’s tutorial, ridiculous word, is about spicing up a lot more than you usually do, not your sex life but a casual yet indifferent outfit. Impressed? I’m joking guys, when the picture speaks for itself and your readers are style heroines, you don’t need any tutorials.  Obviously my Isabel Marant red zebras, except from blinding the carpet, are this feature’s protagonists and obviously the fanciness of a sexy stiletto perfectly upgrades a city look. In any case a pair of colourful pumps is the best reason to celebrate the rebelness of your boyfriend denim and for your eyes only I have put a collage of the most delicious ones of the market. Enjoy.

Jumpsuit Alexander Wang/Coat Halston Heritage/boots Ann Demeulemeester
Ph Jordan Makarof
There was a time, specifically in 2007(when you weren’t even born), that I was clinically obsessed with jumpsuits. And if you think the use of the word “clinically” is an exaggeration for the sake of the blog, boy this time you are…wrong! I can guess your usual practical minds are the great barriers between you and mine, then, totally homogeneous uniformic wardrobe. As far as I can remember, you know my golden-fish-memory issues, that longest list included among others, a black wool one from Zadig & Voltaire, three same but different Marants, a frivolous McCartney and the whole all-in-one collection from ASOS. So, clinically proven, after that period I obviously needed a break. A long, I-only-wear-separates, break.

However when I firstly saw that slickest white Alexander Wang jumpsuit in FW catwalk,the wedding bells have tolled! Bam! Big loves are never forgotten people and here I am tripping back into the old days. I’m all over obsessed!

-Oh….you are weak girl.

-Oh shut up…nobody can resist that….

AMAZING!!

http://www.daintyclub.etsy.com

The perfect jumpsuit, the perfect coat pluuus the perfect boots… ok, it totally blows my mind! That’s exactly what I love about your style – minimalism, simplicity, perfect combo of feminine and masculine. Besides, you make me want to do the bangs 😀

I love love love the jumpsuit. It’s so clean, structured, and other words that I cannot even begin to express!

Imagine one bare-foot week and snorkeling among a wild selection of coral just on the doorstep of your villa. Bonus...the best mochi in the world at the ZEN restaurant. Dreams actually exist.

I always choose pieces that will take me from the morning and beyond. Take for example this Blazé wool-crepe blazer bought on purpose oversized to make the coolest jacket in the morning and the hottest dress for the night. Timeless for real.

The most wanted lips created by Peter Philips with these simple steps: "Apply a beige pencil, this makes the lips dryer and erases the natural lip tone, that way you don't see the red of the lips underneath. Then you smoosh the glitter on, clean up the edges with clear tape, and finish by pressing a tissue over the mouth." There you have it. All shine.

Sleeves have become the protagonists lately, elevating the otherwise staple shirts into statement pieces. My favorite right now comes in this cloudy pink, it's from their SS collection and you can make it yours in a couple of month. Worth waiting.

Who didn’t fell in love with Anja  Rubik’s  playful booties for the advertising campaign of Kurt Geiger. I have good news for all of you who imagined your pretty feet inside them… They’ve just come in the brand’s online shop and they’re really hot. You can find them here.

Fashion is fearless. It’s not about following rules. It’s about feeling good inside your clothes, to be yourself. Today I’ve mixed a checked shirt with an army pant and I’ve felt fabulous. But my greatest pleasure was the moment i saw my husband’s face after he realized that my shirt was actually his….lol

Wearing JCrew pants, Marni (stolen from husband) shirt, Louis Vuitton sandals, and COS bracelet, a gift from my friend Christine. Thank you love, smouts!

Obrigado por finalmente escrevendo sobre >% blog_title % <Amei isso!

I love the whole look and especially the sandals… a hidden LV treasure you found stacked away in your closet, no dought…

Wow, I love how you put these two patterns together!

Links Of London Narrative round disc and anchor charm/ Jason Wu knit(here and here)

Ph Haris Farsarakis

It’s a day dedicated to celebrating the efforts of my colorist to transform me into blonde and still have every single hair attached to my scalp. My last post as a brunette, adios Medusa, will be saluted with my favorite gold, a color that apparently (and hopefully permanently) moved to the upper part of my body. Until recently gold could only be found on my chest and my middle finger.  The first one is a pure, clean engraved with my initials (I adore that, just in case I’m lost you know) disc and a small anchor charm that reminds me my home, the sea and the place I always need to return when my mind gets lost… The second one is my protector. It belonged to my great-grandfather, has been lost in the fields and found by my grandfather while he’d been digging for gold potatoes. With a closer look you can see a tiny rupture from the massive hit on the sapphire, an imperfection to remind me that indeed, there is always an untold story in every single flaw.

ahahahah, bye bye…but u are gorgeous in any case

I love the story about your grandfathers ring. Your nails are the perfect match to the oink sapphire. Goodbye to your dark hair, can’t wait to see how your hair colour affects your choice of colour in clothes.
With love from a fellow fake blondie!!

Wearing Isabel Marant shirt, Gucci pants and pumps, Zara belt.

Let me introduce you to the new sexyfier, I don’t even know if this word exists in the English vocabulary. It’s the new improved version of our old acquaintance, the cropped pant which reached just above our naughty ankles. You could possibly argue that the length’s difference is not enough to consist a new trend. Reasonable enough my readers to have critical minds but believe it or not, the trouser’s expansion on the edge of your ankle’s end, adds a completely fresh flattering and irresistibly feminine twist to your otherwise masculine outfits.

Ps. Check out Columbine how she sports Acne’s rebel denim version of this pant with booties. My super girl!

stunning!love the black and white combination mixed on different patterns !love love loveee it!

 Wearing Current Elliott boyfriend denim, Phillip Lim Split-back wool and cashmere-blend sweater, Dolce & Gabbana lace-up sandals. My fantastic Miu Miu wristlet is a gift from my beloved Christine…Thank you Chris!

And while the infamous Alaïas are  resting forever on the back of my repressed subconscious, yesterday I’ve had  a pretty good enlightenment and somewhere in my messy wardrobe I’ve dug out the pair that will have the honor to replace them. Not as flashy but equally sexy, these killer substitutes  serve perfectly their purpose and lift off every single and perhaps forgotten denim.

 

I’ve been a bit obsessed with lace-up heels lately, these are gorgeous!

Wearing my LWD* from Isabel Marant (find it in sweater here) and the same designer’s Rea sandals, Jimmy Choo fringed clutch, Soixant Neuf Jewels. The double dolphins is my mommy’s, since she was a kid. But I’ve found a beautiful similar here.

If you’re wondering for the  previous two days If I was kidnapped by green-faced aliens and my blog was completely silenced, let me share with you a little story. On Friday I’ve packed my stuff and left with my hubby for my country house which is located 144km away from home. On Saturday a fantastic weather had taken over the city and I’ve had cheerfully dressed up for some glorious sun bathed photo shoot. Only at that point, with my feet suffering inside a new pair of sky-heeled pointy-toes, I’ve realized that I‘ve missed to take with me the most important thing in the world. My camera. The big OMG moment! There I was, feeling mind-less, camera-less and  inevitably blog-less. Shity equation. There was only one solution. I didn’t even pay attention to Alex’s terrified face, I grabbed the car keys and drove nearly 300 km to get my camera back, alone.  I’ve started my long trip at five and I’ve returned at nine o’clock. Oh yes I’ve turned my car into a sky-rocket. And I ask you If that’s not a complete brain cells destruction, then what is It?

 

* little white dress

 

You have officially ALL the things I am dreaming of… Your wardrobe isn’t save once I visit Greece mouhahaha

XO Charlotte

OMG you really did that? you’re deffinitely the perfect-blogger!!! and my fav! xx

Thank you B. Yes they fit true to size. About the sizing I’m not sure…maybe it’s European. I’ve got them in size 41…xo

You look so freaking amazing all the time! Thumbs up!

A breath of freshness that radiates citrus, a sense that brought back all of my restless childhood memories. Happiness... that’s all a perfume is about right?

Photography: Haris Farsarakis | Styling: Apostolis Gofas | Make-up: Marita Politou

 

Seriously obsessing over By Malene’s jewelry line but these earrings just blew my mind. Shot by Haris Farsarakis, backstage at the brand’s SS17 show, a constant reminder that next summer’s jewelry is seriously hot. Below you can find it’s current version and…

A pair that I could honestly wear for 20 years if I wasn’t so clumsy with my shoes. White color is an universal match and although they are sky-high they are surprisingly comfy. Could I really ask for more?

Hey party animals! It’s saturday night and I guess you’re getting ready for something good….Me too. We’re going out with some good friends to burn the dance floors. Thus any romantic mood I’ve had earlier disappeared. But then my Rare Opulence asymmetrical dress hanged on my wardrobe and looked so beautiful with its tiny pinkish flowers. Dear friends there is a law in situations like this and is called layering. So I did. I’ve added my Isabel Marant netty knit and….. tah tah..Downgrading romantism!

Wearing Rare Opulence from Topshop dress, Isabel Marant knit, Alexander Wang shoes.

Thank you. 🙂

must ask you, what do you do to get those legs? 🙂

  Current Elliott boyfriend roll shorts, LNA tee, Celine ID bracelet.
The fourth and the last acquisition from the magestic Rome is so heavy that it could literally lengthen your hands in no time. But it’s that Celine’s designing supremacy which really makes it feel almost featherish. Like???

Hi Evangelie,

please can you tell how much was the bracelet?
found one online but i’m suspicious of the price so i just want to check before i dive in.

thx X

Hi again,

Thanks for your quick reply.
Actually I found two on eBay with a ridiculous pricing of $1800-2000
Heh no luck for me. No Celine stores anywhere near so no bracelet.

  The Jury has decided. The ankle white strapped sexifiers are staying home. I’ll have to admit that their quite obvious resemblance to my Vika sandals has made it too hard for me to decide.  But my Instafriends have spoken. And they want them! So be it.

Wearing Pierre Hardy sandals. Find them in black and white here and If you’ren’t lucky with your size check out here. I’ve also discovered a suprisingly gorgeous orange version of the straps here. That’s all folks.

Love them! They’re the perfect height for every day. Nx

Wearing Acne sweater, Zara tights, Alexander Wang booties, Stella McCartney bag.

Hey style heroines. Let me confess something about my above outfit. I’ve strategically ordered this chunky knit from Acne in size medium. The simple explanation is that I always order my sweaters one size bigger, yes I really do. The complicated is based on reverse psychology, the looser it feels, the sexier it looks. Evidently my newest acquisition defeated the purpose of my little plan but in an unexpected yet joyful way. The jumper was so oversized that instantly turned into a dress. I guess I love surprises.

 

I really love that sweater, that color is absolutely amazing.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Let me reassure you that all this sudden color explosion lately, is definitely not due to a crazy hormonal outburst. Not that I don’t have these kind of Super Novas from time to time, God help whoever stands by me, hubby that is. It’s just when perfection in the form of a tuxedo, knocks your door, the depicted muted green is the best black you’ve ever had. On a short (honest) notice…this is a tailored awesomeness!! Woot, woot!

love the whole outfit
 the colour is amazing
and the boots are so cool
well done ……….great sense of style

Bonheur top/Current Elliott shorts/Saint Laurent boots/Paul Smith hat  /Chanel bag/Tom Wood rings

Photos by Jordan Makarof.

Well I’ve never been much of a cat person but since Lucy( initially named Pussy, a name that inevitably got banished after my mom almost had a heart attack-I didn’t know by then that vagina had multiple slangs, I was innocent ok?) was found  under the hood of my dad’s car, staring at me with her big green feline eyes, I’ve decided to give it a try. These eyes were nasty…I should have known better…That cat was really weird. One of her mega-quirks was that she had developed a surely kinky closet fetish. At the beginning she had paid more attention to my clothes and shoes than me but once I’ve found her with her face inside of one of my bras I knew it was kind of….concerning…Not shirts, not stockings, not even panties really…Just bras. In every shape and color. Anyways when I’ve tried to keep them out of reach she found the way to escape and ran into the neighbor’s house and eventually into her closet. Mrs Helen should be really pissed-off surpised, when she saw my devil-cat  flying across the room with a bra dangling from her mouth. That strange habit continued for about six months, with our neighbors returning the Lucy-package on regular basis, until one day we’ve lost her…And in that exact moment I’ve realised that It’s better to be nasty than boring. That cat had A character and I really, really miss her. I can swear that there are still times that I’m looking  for these sparkling little devilish feline eyes….So you might wonder where it all come from..What I’m drunk? Shut up…What would you like to chat about? How on earth a broderie anglaise top did match with destructed denim? I think you’re better than that. If you’re gonna love me you must know me better…;) 

Yummie yummie

You’re rocking the denim shorts and ankle boots!

Corporate Catwalk

Haha, such a fun story! I sadly don’t own any animals with weird fetishes, just a horse who enjoyes chocolate and coke. So I’m gonna talk about those boots… they’re truly amazeballs! I’ve been obsessed with them for so long I wouldn’t be surprised if I’d wake up in the middle of the night, only to find out I dreamt about them…  

X Marjolein – Never Too Polished.com

I love your stories – often the fashion does its own talking so if we are to read we will enjoy your ‘drunk’ stories.  I have my dog and he has a big character but fortunately no fetish for bras… just carrots.

Thankfifi

WOW girl, really loving this pics.

Ph Jordan Makarof

Editing by me.

I remain in good-Jimmy Choo-company for the second day, this time with a pair of understated sexifiers. Yes understated because cropped booties never had the very nasty reputation of the killer skyscraper-ed heeled pointy toes yet they can be a major elongator for your limbs and eventually a mega eye magnet. All that happens if the shoe maker has geniously cropped them just above the ankle. For the rest you’ll probably end up looking like a compressed giraffe.

Cheers to life-lessons.

I suppose it’s the psychedelic nature of an hormone-striken Pisces, who from the total homogeneity of the previous post, jumps to a whirlwind of fabrics and textures. But then again, this is the story of my life.

From tweed to sequins and jersey, I tell you guys  I’ve totally enjoyed every single of it and if I’ve had a second chance to name the outfit, I would have called it ” U.NI.O”, aka ultimate night outfit. Comfy and yet quite sexy, rock  but also rebelous , you have to admit it style heroines this is so you. Because me is…you! Right? Right!

Knit Equipment(and in heavenly gray)/Leather skirt Versace/Bag M2Malletier/Booties Miu Miu/ Earring I AM
Ph Haris Farsarakis

My last editorial for Net-A-Porter Holiday(and one of my last as a brunette, if you haven’t already noticed, yes I’ve been transformed into a strawberry blonde and I adore it) is all about fantasy gifts. Fantasy gifts as popular as a pair of sexy stilettos, to the rare and kinda humble ones, like the perfect cashmere knit. Yes it was that hard to find it that inevitably ended up as a fantasy. Equipment knows well how to make shirts and latest, almost surprisingly, armies of absolutely gorgeous knits. Heavenly soft and  totally luxurious. The trust pal to accompany our days or the not-so-dressy nights. Never be lonely again….

So do tell, what’s your fantasy gift? Maybe Santa can hear you….Speak louder!

If you’ve dreamt of having swimmer’s body, Demna Gvasalia might have just listened your thoughts. The standout piece of this season is a reworked classic with padded shoulders. I love to wear it tucked into high-waisted denim for a more feminine feel.

  Wearing IRO shorts, Acne top, Zara jacket, Giuseppe Zanotti sandals, Chanel bag.

Except of my unexpected explosion of happiness, you know If I’m going to smile I’ll I totally enjoy it, you should notice the versatility of this outfit. It’s simply a fun demonstration of my favorite summer essentials, the big five as I love saying. To begin with take a look at  my extra buffed shoulders, just joking, and the tweed jacket. It looks perfect with practically everything and it’s a definite savior for the windy night strolls in the Greek islands. You will however have to stay consistent in a light colour pallet. Let’s move ahead to the simple white tee. I think that there’s no introductions or explanations needed for that. Below is another tweed but far more playful than the aforementioned one. The distressed tweed shorts. Classy and yet quite sexy. Exactly like us..! And while you wish to continue torturing your feet with serial killer stilettos my fourth essential is or better are the flat sandals. Choose the spiked ones for some nasty kicks when needed. And finally the glam factor, an all-day shoulder bag spiced with some alluring accents, chain, brooches, etc because I know us, we really need an extra shine…don’t we?

it’s like these pictures were shot in Marocco or something! the outfit is perfect as always!

Wearing Romwe shorts, Alexander Wang sweater, Gucci pumps, Alexander Wang clutch.

All you need, except from love, is an absolutely striking pair of shoes to make every single outfit the hypest in mankind. Proving my words worth I’ll take a step further and I’ll ask you what’s the first thing that comes to your fashionable minds looking at the upper part of my body? re: that crazy bitch.. seems too old for high school uniform. And then descending, the revelation…re: running in heels? No sillies, now you  should say, damn hot combo…but how old is she? I shouldn’t play this game again…Joking my style heroines but to conclude, I’d like to advice you to take the opportunity and celebrate yourselves this Christmas with the most rocking high-heeled pointy-toes ever. They’ll flatter and sexify your beautiful legs even though eventually they do destroy them.

 

 

Love your blog!! And that sweater!

Speaking of that Alexander Wang sweater, it is on sale and I want it bad. the problem is that it is only available in XS and L.. I’m about the same size as you do so I guess a S would be the ideal but in this case…which size should I go for??? Help!!

Thanks!

Hi Wency, thank you for your kind words. A.Wang is pretty generous with the sizing. So I think that xs should be ok as it fits as a regural s.
xo

I love that sweater on you! I think I want to get it too.  May I ask what size you are wearing?

Hi Jacqueline, I wear a size small and it’s as loose as I’ve wanted it… I’m usually a size small or us 4. I hope I’ve helped;-)xo

You are just about to witness my whole 7 days with the best male companion(my husband is obviously excluded). Behold the first day with the only man who will never complain about your shoe addiction. My personal editorial for Jimmy Choo stylemakers is live. Enjoy.

Ah such a cool location for these photos,  you look amazing!

Completely wonderful – congratulations!x

Thankfifi

Legs legs legs, amazing, you’re going to make JC sell out of those biker boots!

Evangelie, this is just awesome! I obviously love the outfit, combination of light clothes and heavy boots, a color choice. But the whole editorial really took my breath away! This scenery, touch of blue/turquoise… It is so fresh, I can feel summer vibes when I look at this, even though it’s only early spring here in Poland. 

I think I’m gonna look at these pictures every morning to give myself more energy before summer 😉

Thank you Izabel!!!!!!!!xoxoxoxo

Each one of these styles is just perfect!!!  Bravo!!!

Redhead Illusion

Such a cool outfit. Love the boots<3

  Wearing Zimmermann broderie anglaise cotton playsuit, Chloe braided sandals( and black), Jimmy Choo bag, Ileana Makri necklace.

You know I really gotta feeling that broderie anglaise gonna be the new navajo. That consequently means that our brains will get drilled so much by it that we’ll surely experience a whole new holey summer.
Time for some serious talk now. I want to thank each one of you, for your wonderful wishes and your amazing words. I can’t even express how happy you’ve made me feel. You’re my all guys…

Love the playsuit and shoes! I see that you have changed the design of your blog! I like it a lot. I’ve changed mine too, tell me how you find it.

Urgent! I need your precious help. I’ve wanted a pair of shoes with low heel for heavy walking and after a lot of search I’m in between these two pretties from Alexander Wang. But I need only one and I cannot decide whitch of them I should keep. What do you think?

the grey ones r classy and elegant.
the black ones r definately more sexy and easy to wear.
i wish i could help….. but i say BOTH !!!

I would say the black ones look more your style so go for it, unless you have a similar pair in your closet.

The blacks! sexier!!!

BOTH OF THEM!!!!!!!!!

Valentino Haute Couture goes to NY and I’m extremely honored to be able to watch live the House’s magnificence and taste this one-of-a kind experience. If you want to be my fellow passengers in this dream, you can also see the Haute Couture show in real-time below. Enjoy…(I’m really getting goosebumps)

 

Thank you Valentino team for having me in NY. It’s my honor.



Amazing show. It is an honor not only for you, but for us as well. Having such a talented blogger based in Greece makes us feel proud of Greek fashion and aesthetics.
Kisses from mademoiselle-rania.blogspot.com

ph Jordan Makarof

Are you lost in translation*?

-Kind off..But Isn’t our relationship always like that? Somehow complicated?

Well, then let me clear that up for you. “Arni” is a Greek word and means sheep. So I’ve though that since I am resembling with the aforementioned species, it could be really useful to multilingually mention it. Yes I know it’s very risky but please don’t start a fur debate again. Afterall I am not a vegetarian, wouldn’t it be very hypocritical If I was a sworn enemy of shearling?

 

*(Btw I’ve never seen that movie. Is it nice?)

I love the interplay of the leather pants and the trainers!

Isabel Marant shirt(also here)/Isabel Marant pants(also here)/Celine heels(similar here)/Tom Wood rings/Freeshop wing ring
Photos by Jordan Makarof

It’s officially spring people and it’s always this very moment of time when I put my chromatic fears behind me and my kind of ‘experimental’, sometimes frightening, nature takes over. I guess I’m not the only one that the sweet scent of blooming spring flowers and the overload of vitamin D alternates her brain-cells….no? 


This Isabel Marant collection is seriously amazing!!! I love all the pieces you bought & I’ve been eye-ing this top on Luisaviaroma (it’s on sale! :D). Maybe I should get it. Hmm…

waw! Hawai <3

Hi Ev,

Wicked outfit!

I’ve got a serious question for you, as you should know about these things. 🙂
The suede Saint Laurent ankle boot. Are there two styles?? There’s a pair called the Paris boot online at Harrods and Harvey Nichols. This Paris boot heel seems to be taller but it essentially looks the same as the “ankle” boots. Are they the same boot?  Or did they put out two diff size heels?  I’m going crazy! 

Any help would amazing. And how did you find the sizing?  I normally wear 39 in IM boots. Should I be ok with a 39 in these SL boots?

Look forward to your response. 

Merci!!

Yvonne Marie

Hi Yvonne Marie,
as far as I know it’s only one style, the Paris boots with a descent 9cm heel:)
I’ve sized up(half a size). I’ve got them in 41.5.
I hope I’ve helped a bit…:)
xoxoxoxo

Wearing Alexander Wang leather pants, Zadig & Voltaire leather shirt, Gucci pumps, Ray-Ban sunglasses, Celine Phantom bag.

I knew that It was only a matter of time until the word total to connect with our beloved leather. At the begging it might sound slightly unusual to you but think about the pajama pants trend. At first you was shocked but you’ve surprisingly embrace it in a glimpse of an eye.

Looks like we have a very fetish season ahead.

I just found this look when I was looking for a leather ‘oversized’ pants. I LOVE IT!! Did I say that already 😉 Anyway, too bad I can’t find my size anymore. Do you think the wool one with leather panels (also Wang) is cool too?! XO

Baby they’re amazing and size down, go for a size 2. They’ll look fab on you. http://www.theoutnet.com/product/274862

Hey style heroines…Today in rocking news there’s a solar eclipse. No, no, no don’t get terrified. This is a good one. Something like the Santa of the universe. BUT, why there must be always a but, blame it on retrograde Mercury for all the delays especially in communications. How many servers have crashed today, eh?  Enough with the astrology lessons. Well today i’m channeling Madonna’s Express Yourself… the male part. It’s a playing dirty role in a fashion scene that looks and feels untouchable. But then again there’s this understated sexiness when putting together the same fabrics that elevates the nonchalantly of a total denim outfit.  Importantly enough to be mentioned, this look demands the absence of heavy makeup and styled hair. After all your target will be to resemble with working stuff, right?

Wearing H&M denim shirt, Isabel Marant’s Eric patchwork skinny jeans and the same designer’s belt (from last season).

 

 

 

I am in love with the patchwork denim 🙂

XX,
Miranda

perfect as always…..xx

Wearing Current Elliott jeans, T by Alexander Wang top, Serendipity jacket, Alexander Wang Ashley booties, Celine bag, Ray-Ban aviators.

Today we’ll talk about basics or better the most basic of all: The denim.

You’ll have to admit that it’s not the easiest thing to find a pair of jeans that fit you like a glove or maybe in an unexpected twist of luck, to massively sexyfy you. But I promise you girlfriends there is a brand out there that it’s jeans actually do all the aforementioned and even more. It’s Current Elliott. Frequently you’ve seen me flashing them in my blog but I’ve never clearly stated my obsession’s origin:  I really consider them the anti-gravity pills of the lower body. Really. Pull and UP! And stay up! Get it? Insane…

 

J’ ADORE! the jacket is simply gorgeous!

Cool outfit. How are The sizing for these jeans?
Thanks,
Helle

Thank you Helle, I wear 26 size in Current Elliott skinnies.xo

I know I say this often…But this outfit really does rock Ev 🙂 The details on the jacket are great and you just look so cool!

  Balenciaga trainers (or at Balenciaga Boutique if you live in Athens)

Photo by Jordan Makarof.

Well to start off I just wanted to say that deep down my feet have always wanted to have fish scales. By the way I need a real working mermaid spell. Does anyone know any? However Nicolas Ghesquière, before he jetted off to destination unknown, managed to give my feet some kind of  their much wanted aquatic nature. Fish scale trainers!

Life under the sea is in-deep indeed fabulous;)

perfect perfect sneakers – I love the colour and texture

Thankfifi

I like the colour combination of those sneakers!

They look amazing. Romina

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

 Smythson Panama tote/ Balenciaga skirt/ Balenciaga sweater/ Saint Laurent boots(here, here and here)/Jimmy Choo sunglasses/Apriati rings

ph Jordan Makarof  

editing by me

They say “It’s not the destination, but the journey”. Well I….disagree and please read my lips because I’m gonna whisper you… it’s about everything!! From the packing preparations, to consider the airport outfit, from the instant excitement when stepping into the terminal, to the major thrill when you reach your destination. Every single moment when you travel is just awesome! I will never forget guys the feeling when the plane landed at Bora Bora, the last destination of my honeymoon. That feeling when you are officially in paradise, no sins attached, facing the glittering waters of an emerald lagoon and a mountain  rising dramatically out of the ocean as if by magic.  That feeling was everything.


Common factor to all these moments: A bag! A savior! Not backpack, no, no I am a backpacking failure. A tote. I always rely on a statement tote as my travel must-have. A super stylish yet comfortable to carry piece. So you can imagine how friggin excited I was when I got my hands on that Smythson bag. The grey-elephant Panama tote. A real beauty. The double joy came when I’ve noticed that the inspired by the legendary Panama diaries ultra clean shaped Smythson piece was also customized with my golden initials! Aaaaand…..here is your surprise…one of them CAN BE YOURS!!!! Don’t you just love me? You only need to follow the below super easy steps:

– Go to MyTheresa.com and the Smythson product page.

– Choose your favorite product.

– Click on one of the following social media chanel, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+ or email on MYTHERESA page and share why you love it, using the #LovePanama.

THAT’S IT! The bag can be yours. Monogrammed! There will be also a second prize a Smythson notebook and a third, a Smythson card holder. The winner will be announced on April the 2nd!

Good luck!

 

 

 

I’m beyond excited that I won this competition! I feel so lucky, and I’m glad you shared this and gave me the chance to win it. Can’t wait to receive my own Panama tote!

xx

Congrats!!!!! I am really so happy for you! Enjoy it Camilla, it’s fantastic!!!!
❤️❤️❤️

Stunning, gorgeous..aktually I have no words !!The MUST have outfit friend.<3

A few days after yours, Helena Bordon’s photo showed up, too.  She’s the wearing the same kitty coat you had here. 🙂

Love your choice of collab, this bag and JC shoes are befitting of your style.  I really, really enjoy seeing you and the beautiful combo you created with the products.  

Serena

Thank you Serena! I saw those awesome pics! Yes I love being creative lately and I really hope you like them.
xoxo

I swear I fell in love with this bag. I fell for a bag, that’s just great… 😀 As a simplicity lover and a huge fan of gray I must say, this tote has the perfect shade! And it’s a TOTE. Oh no, my love is even bigger now… Of course I already gave myself a try in this giveaway 😀

Moving on, you look stunning as always girl 🙂 All black really suits you. Ok, move on to the next post to give you more compliments 😉

What a gorgeous bag (and lovely outfit to match)! I’ve loved their notebooks and journals for as long as I can remember. Not that I can afford them, but they’re nice to look at.

You should do a ‘what’s in my bag’ post.

Wearing Zara tweed coat, Isabel Marant tee( similar  here), Current Elliott destroyed boyfriend denim(find them here and here), Givenchy Obsedia cuff, Dolce & Gabbana booties, Chanel Boy Bag.

Hot N Cold! I’m telling you girlfriends the latest turn of the weather into Arctic degrees is incredibly insane. But do note my braveness to stand tall in the rain and celebrate the greatest “a la Chanel” tweed coat of all! Cream coloroured and elegantly structured, is the ultimate proof that sometimes pricing can be quite as alluring as the looks. Do tell…isn’t it fab?

 Wearing Zara top, Phillip Lim pants(find them here and here), Isabel Marant Rea sandals, Gucci sunglasses, Givenchy cuff, crocodile clutch from Bangkok.

Well I have to admit that a couple of years ago, only with the tought of wearing leather in summer I was feeling slightly or better completely cookoo. But times have changed and leather got a more  light-weight/ hot weather approved texture, not to mention the straps( probably the biggest intervention after the wheel) . So here I am under Greek May’s hot sun, sporting the aforementioned trend, with a huge TV set on my head and the most fantastic pecan coloured trousers in the world. Like?

Thank you so much for your very clear and helpful advice!! You are really not only beautiful and stylish but also sooooo kind 🙂

Ahhhh thank you Munny, I’m always here  😉

Hello, hallo,

you look so great as always 🙂
I interest in this Phillip Lim Pants but Phillip Lim sizing is always a kind of problem for me….. mostly bigger to size!
Could you please let me have your advice which size of these Phillip Lim Pants you are wearing on? I assume size 2 or 4 you may be wearing on, but I appreciate your helpful size advice! Thanx!!!

Hi Munny, I wear them in size 4 but I’ve wanted them to be loose. All Lim’s pants look amazing when they sit low on the waist. I’m usual size 2-4 or 26 in jeans. I hope I’ve helped.

Love this look. The leather cami is my favorite look out this entire ensemble.

Hi,

I just bought the Rio sandals from NAP and really could do with some advice from you :-).. I bought them in my normal size, but they seem a bit too small, as I slip forward and my toes go out over the sandals in the front.. Unfortunately, I cannot try on a size bigger (sold out), and also unsure whether this will actually solve the problem or they will just be too big in the back of the sandal and I will still slip forward like I do in these.. Have tried with all sorts of inserts/foot petals which helps to a certain point, but still my toes go out over the sandals and the strap over the toes hurt quite much.. Do/did you have the same problem..? Any miracle solutions? Did you have the possibility of trying two different sizes before buying..? Does the front strap also hurt your toes or has it become a bit softer..? Could do with your feedback asap, as I need to return them to NAP in a couple of days, if I decide not to keep them..

Take care.

xx
Berit

Hi Berit, I’ve got the Rea sandals which are shorter than yours and imagine that my feet also slip forwrd, but I can understand that the problem will be worst with the higher ones. First of all you should sit down and slip your feet back to see if your toes go over your sandals. If not it’s your size and all these stuff happen cause they’re pretty high and the straps pretty loose. If yes just send them back. Sizing up shouldn’t be a solution because they fit normal and you problem could get to worst. The straps don’t heart me, but I can guess that all these happen cause the sandals are too high. Also if you notice the model’s feet at the IM catwalk their toes also slip…..It’s a problem…what can i say…
Hope I’ve helped a little…

Wearing Topshop mint top, it is currently sold out but check its other colours here, Boutique tank, H&M PU pants, Isabel Marant hooded coat and the same designer’s trainers, Alexander Wang Lydia clutch, find it in metallic-bronze here.

First of all I would like to address to my favorite bloggers, Cindy from cottds, Charlotte from thefashionguitar, Miranda from thechicsheet and Bianca from iletaitunefois and tell them that this six months fetus called styleheroine and I personally want to thank you for your love and support in our early steps in blogosphere. You’re so precious.

So today we’ll  look to the best fashion trend since probably fringing, aka the Pocahontas cloning. The mint.

The designers in their desperate attempt to embark a healthier diet, decided to give up the luscious flavors of the mint and  pistachio ice creams from their eating habits, and instead successfully embrace their shades to their resort catwalks. Seriously? Nah…

But who could say no to such a sweet and massively flattering color palette? Me…never!

As the evidence of the aforementioned behold one of the best mintish collections, from Acne Resort 12, already available online. Enjoy.

1. Shore oversized chunky-knit cotton sweater, 2. Lia cable-knit cotton sweater, 3. Beeta Lux wool-crepe jacket. The Lucille Taffeta dress is available here.




Hey you! Great blog, just found you… you really manage to pull it off with your sneakers but still look chic. Amazing!

A fur affair just begun. Drama at its best, maximizing the impact of a rockstar attitude and yet quite cool and cozy if it’s dressed down like I did. Ultimately the decision is yours… if you’d rushed, for a fur coat that looks and feels absolute fantastic.

WearingTopshop fur, Current/Elliott denim, Etoile t-shirt.

What a picture, what a fur!!!! Amazing!!

This fur is fantastic!!!

Great outfit, funny enough my favorite piece is your thumb ring.

AWESOME FUR!!!!!AWESOME GIRL!!!!!XX

Wearing Balmain swimsuit(yes it’s the same with Saturday night’s Instagram pic),  Balmain denim skirt, Stella McCartney sunglasses, Celine bracelet and Isabel Marant sandals.

My baby has just turned one year old, woohoo**. I’m so proud..and kind of emotional I guess… Common I’m a new mommy…

Now that we’ve become pals, I have to confess that blogging is not that easy. It’s no secret that it’s an exhausting full-time job demanding tons of time/energy and while it’s ultimately nothing new, there will be times, especially at the beginning, that you’ll face the criticism from people who don’t understand it and characterize your personal decision, among other things, rather stupid. After one year though, meeting all of you utterly wonderful, super kind, gentle-hearted readers, receiving unbelievable love and eventually making amazing new strong friendships through styleheroine, I can proudly declare that I’d rather be stupid than boring.

The fantastic pics are taken from Charlie Makkos, one of Greece’s best photographers,who was brave enough to shoot me under 40 degrees.Thank you Charlie.

Congratulations Evangelie!
I love your blog/your style. You give me so much inspiration. Thanks for that!
(I wish i could afford the same things.. 😉
You are beautiful and i hope you will continue blogging for a long time.
xoxo Eva

no comments… I’m obsessed! happy 1 year anniversary darling 🙂

Gucci leather pants(the best out there, sorry guys), Angora sweater,similar  Saint Laurent and Balmain, Miu Miu boots,M2Malletier bag

Ph Haris Farsarakis

In partnership with NET-A-PORTER.
Stocking fillers…and I don’t mean your toes..I simply refer to all the goodness the “Stocking Fillers” fantasy lock-up has to offer. Wouldn’t it  be so much easier  if we knew that we could dig-up something just from that wish-room from our father’s hanging stocks? I’m just saying…..

On another note the sisterhood of the traveling Gucci pants salutes you from beautiful yet rainy NY. Of course I have them with me…What were you thinking?

Ps. And don’t forget, Net-A-Porter’s free shipping ends on Monday! Hurry-up!


Nice Look and pictures

    Wearing Vince sweater, Etoile corduroy pants, Isabel Marant fancy zebras.

Hey darlings! I swear I’ve tried to resist, but from this morning I’m officially sick! Even the coziness of my corduroy pants failed to make me feel better, leaving me no choice than to get some sleep. Power sleep! So goodnight my loves, tomorrow is another day…Pfffff, I must be really sick!

And while I’ve wished I was on a sunbed sporting a swimsuit in the above colour combination, I’ll move on and give the winter a chance. A chance to shine. Colour shine. You have to admit it guys, It’s a perfect all-weather match, isn’t it?

Wearing Whyred pants, Topshop Boutique coat, Alexander Wang booties.

Seriously have fallen in love with alllll of your outfits.

You have these lovely pair of colored Python heaven?! Ahhhhh, they are such a great addition 😉 I am in love with colorful Python prints at the moment and this post just gave me my daily fix 😉

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Wearing James Long dress(find it in sweater here), Alexander Wang booties, Jerome Dreyfuss Bobi bag (find it in brown here), Mawi ring.

Should I feel so singled out that I hate tights? I suppose that I’m not the only one…Come on…There should be others of my kind out there…Right? But in case you’re worried that my risky tactics will eventually harm my health, you’ll be pleased to know that this wool and alpaca blend James Long extra thick dress feels like an early summer’s Sunday morning.

 

 

amazing look.
i can’t believe im not following you yet on bloglovin. but im doing it now so i dont miss out on your posts

Wearing 3.1 Phillip Lim trousers (find them here or at Zilly if you’re living in Athens), Equipment blouse(find it here and here, Alexander Wang sandals. My oversized crocodile clutch is from Bangkok.

Celebrating the “koulouma”(a national festivity) in my country home hasn’t left me much time for blogging, but definitely massively time for extravagant fashions and outrageous eating.

Yesterday was such a perfect day, unexpectedly warm for winter thus an ultimate chance to expose my feet to the public without people look at me like I’m an alien. A pale one!

My capeless Fabianas were my first choise for a simple but spring composition which went like this:  my new heavenly silk Phillip Lim feather blue pants contrasted with the thriving dark side of a sexy black Equipment blouse unbuttoned. Like?

The pictures are breathtaking and then there is the outfit 🙂 Those heels and those pants are just perfection.
Love it!

Lanvin turban//Tom Wood rings//Alexander Wang boots//Celine bag//Acne playsuit//Matthew Williamson sunglasses (via FreeShop)

Photos by Jordan Makarof.

Aloha! Suppose you’re stuck in the city but your thoughts are helicopt-ing over Kauai’s pyramid-shaped glorified mountain peaks. Awkward? Nooo..Rather daily routine it is. So, tell me. What would you wear? Obviously you wouldn’t wear flip-flops. Summer has yet to come. But a play-suit…for your play-me(s)….Oh yes… That’s the spirit. The truth is that after an uncharacteristic insta-envy for all the pretty vacation feeds, I’ve decided that the only way to finally get over it, is to act like a tourist in your own city.  A turban covering the head, a lightweight silk on body and the National Garden at it’s best. Afterall If so does work for me, why not for everybody else?

 

Amazing boots!

There are no words to discribe this outfit.
We are SPEECHLESS!
Congrats Evangelie!

  Lopy is wearing American Apparel sweater, Zara shorts (similar here) , Dannijo x Man Repeller Leeloo necklace, Ancient Greek Ikaria sandals.
Lopy’s name shouldn’t be a surprise for my loyal, loving, readers. Now for the new ones let me introduce you to her. She’s my insanely stylish, ridiculously gorgeous friend, continuously hosted in my brainchild. So today Lopy rocks two of the coolest things for this summer. The hypnotic evil eye sparkler, an awesome collaboration between my style heroine Leandra Medine and the Dannijo sisters, and the wingy Ancient Greek Sandals. The last ones, as their name implies, are the evolutional designs of my country’s heritage footwear. In fact I’m quite stunned by the exquisite work their designer, Christina Martini, has done on them. If only you could see the detail of a delicate wing clasp on every single sandal. Obsessed!

And while most of you are preparing to fly off to exotic parts unknown here’s my little contribution. My favorites from the Ancient Greek Sandals ready to be loved. Choose n’ fly.

1.Nausica 2. Pythia 3.Ikaria 4. Ariadne 5. Melisanthi 6. Melpomeni 7. Medea 8. Athena

I love the Ancient Greek Sandals range! Especially the wings pair that Lopy is wearing. I’m off to my favourite Greek island Paros in July- I’d love a pair for my trip!

Love your blog x

http://brightonstylememos.blogspot.co.uk/

Oh give it to me (the necklace and sandals!)

XO C

Indeed your friend is very stylish also!

♥ ThankFifi

Lopy looks beautiful and her outfit is just lovely! Those sandals are amazing – love em!

Wearing Zara oversized blazer, J Brand  denim, T by Alexander Wang t-shirt, Isabel Marant Willow sneakers and belt (similar here), Celine Phantom bag, Kenneth Jay Lane earings.

Pretending that I’m chasing the sun in a fantastic early spring look-alike Friday afternoon, with my massively large blazer, the best acquisition  ever succeeded by a living human being during a sale period. From 90 euros only 19. I deserve a high-five, don’t I?

                                       Carven knit, Nowhere pants, YSL pumps.

Photos by Charlie Makkos.

Hey style heroines. I’ve missed you so much, but I was week ending in the mountain province and the internet connection was slower than the economic recovery. BUT I’m back with the best news. Two weeks before I’ve enthusiastically accepted to be featured in StyleBy, Sweden’s amazing fashion magazine. It was a crazy photo shoot in my house with outfits from my wardrobe.  A special glimpse to my daily routine, something to get to know me a little better. The fruits of our labor, you will taste on the 30th of November and I’m sure you’re gonna love them. Above is one of the several looks I’ve styled but it won’t be showed as here. I don’t wanna spoil the surprise, ok?

A special thanks to Jonna Bergh, StyleBy’s lovely editor in chief, for the absolutely perfect cooperation and the kindness to send me a couple of the magazine’s copies . StyleBy is an utterly inspiring eye candy Jonna. Love it!

 

Hi, I just found same Carven knit on sale. Will you still going to wear it this year? Are you satisfy with this sweater? U look gorgeous :)) and thanks for your kind help. xx

Hi dear..I probably will but I have to warn you that it needs to be layered because it’s texture is not soft. Itchy…
xoxoxo

oh..really? Well I ll have to wait to receive it. But its true that this was almost the ultimate sweater of previous season, but I was unable to find it anywhere. hmmm what to do, what to do? 🙂 xoxo

Thanks to you too! It became a truly inspirational spread in STYLEBY #6. Our readers will LOVE it!

Whoo hoo, can’t wait!

Congrats… Can’t wait to see StyleBy…by the way the knit is super!

  Wearing American Vintage tee, Isabel Marant mesh top, Phillip Lim pants, Celine sandals (check out these nice lookalikes), Chanel bag.
Good morning girls! New week ahead and what better way to start it than looking and feeling completely relaxed. Let’s Ignore my toasted by the sun facial expression and concentrate a little at Da pants. It really is summer now and I have to confess that after kicking off the weekend with a couple, super tight, sausage makers, pencil skirts I’ve decided to give my legs something to breath. Silky sweatpants. The only ensemble at the moment that my limbs don’t want to get out and socialize. I’ve mixed it with a mesh top and a simple tank because…what you’ve forgotten it? We’re preparing for the Olympics! Woohoo! Happy Monday babes. Love you!

Ok ok I know.. I am unexcusable ..buuuut my friend this is you after all..Just amazing always!!A must outfit! I already miss you my godess <3 Kisses from Düsseldorf **

I miss you too baby….

gosh, I love this outfit

  From the last photo: Pants/Zara Jacket/Mary Katrantzou printed pants/Stella McCartney printed shirt/Stella McCartney  clutch/Saint Laurent  (via LisaWorld)

Photos by Charlie Makkos.

Close-up photo of my shoes is by me.

You’ve asked for it and my wandering mind had juggled multiple thoughts of how it’d gonna work best. However after just two days the very same mind retired to Big Kahuna to participate in the Celebrity Bartender Challenge. But it only needed a good reason(in this case it’s Lurve) and the great mind immediately got the return ticket. I know…you probably haven’t understood anything…so… behold, as you’ve always asked, some precious corners of my favorite place in the world, my home. Given the chance of shooting in my personal space the other day  we’ve extended somehow the clicks just to see from where all the love and shoes originally come from. And it’s a black and white story again….of course!

Hi! I love your art collection. I love the eagle piece especially. I’m decorating my place and would love to know where you sourced it from? Many thanks, Hanna

Hi Hanna,
thank you dear. So the eagle is from the photographer Ruth Marcus.

I love the blinds in your space…Can you tell me what the manufacturer of these are pretty please…..

Thanks

I really don’t even remember.. We had ordered them from a store in Munich many years ago….they’re black and wooden.

If your hand is itchy enough to start spending for this fall, this trend should be first in your list. Let your inner catwoman shine and grab the first leopard pants you see from the crotch and don’t let them from your sight. They’re yourssssss!

My lunatic obsession became the cheeky spots of these Etoile Isabel Marant pants. Miiiiiiine! My featherish black knit is from Vince and the bracelet is Hermes.

I actually love leopard prints!!!Lovely pants, great style!

Love it kitty cat!

Wow, you look absolutely fantastic! I am completely in love with your pants and sweater! Love your blog and now following! Maybe you’ll have time to visit mine:)

Gucci coat/ Equipment sweater/Gucci leather pants/Miu Miu boots/M2Malletier bag/I AM by Ileana Makri  earring

Photography Haris Farsarakis

In partnership with NET-A-PORTER.

And Net-A-Porter continues…yes! Continues to teach us how to be “merry’ until Christmas. By choosing the hero pieces, that is, the play-safe-stay-forever pieces, the items that my daughter(the mini heroine) might inherit (if she excited). The Can’t Go Wrong room is a reinvention of the great classics and my soft spot. Honestly someone should spread asap that rumor to all our boys..

There’s is this place that you can’t go wrong….don’t walk RUN!
Ps: the depicted Gucci leather pants are the best i’ve ever owned and probably the best(est) ever in the market. You just have to feel them…

  



This is amazing, very Largerfeld-esq

Monday again. Hey how are you doing my little angels? Back to work? Uhhhh..me too. Don’t worry fall is coming and it seems promiscuous, in the fashion aspect of course. So take a tiny sneak peek of what is going to  happen the upcoming season. CONTRASTS. Black and white, parkas and dresses, wool and metallics. I’m extremely happy with two in one trend because I’ve always loved mixing…everything. Today I’m wearing these super cool disco pants from Alexander Wang with an absolutely chic structured wool top from Roksanda Ilincic and my rocking Fabianas. See what I was talking about? Pure contrast.

The disco pants are perfect!The contrast is really inspiring…

Super!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!For one more time!!!!

I really like this style and you make it look perfect!

FANTASTIC!!!!!!

I love mixing different colors, textures, prints so ye love this trend.

                          Wearing Boutique graduated mohair dress, Isabel Marant fringe boots, Jerome Dreyfuss bag.

I guess on Sundays I just need a break of any kind of fanciness. Blame it on last night’s clubbing marathon or the satanic sequins that literally stung my butt in any desperate attempt to sit down but every single cell of my body wanted, prayed for the coziness of a soft wool dress. Needless to say that the above knit from Boutique was the perfect antidote. Without trying too hard, this surprisingly stylish semi transparent warmer, gave me the instant love that I’ve needed and the chicness that I’ve hoped for. Yeah!

Hi.. Just found your blog; it’s absolutely amazing.. Your style is so inspirational. I am also a huge Isabel Marant fan; have the fringed boots in both the knee-high and cropped version – and find the Topshop dress so cool with the boots. Before ordering the dress online, I would be so grateful if you would let me know which size you are wearing; I want the oversized look like you, but not sure whether to order a UK 6 or 8..? Thanks; have a great day.

Goodmorning Berit, thank you for your wonderful words…I’ve ordered it in size 8( my normal size) and it is quite loose. So I would advice you to not size up. I hope I’ve helped…

  Boots/Saint Laurent     top/Balenciaga      shorts/Balenciaga(check out this beauty)      headpiece/Balenciaga(still availability at Balenciaga Boutique Athens alongside with Da Rings…if you know what I mean)

Photos by Charlie Makkos.

What’s up guys? What… me? Well…here goes, I’m one year older, I’m officially a hormonal teen Dinosaur–OUCH-somebody shut my tail in the door, I’ve frivolously celebrated my name-day,I’ll show you my gift in a following post;), in this part of Europe we paint the town red when that day comes (and a minor wikipedia-esque interpretation: Evangelia means ” one who brings good news“…hehehe…I’m literally an awesomeness deliverer! What? Did someone just say something? Bad readers…Erm…) and last but not least I’ve been LURVED.

It was right at the time when I was on my usual Colsade*, flipping through every single shelved publication in just one hour when my sartorial brain-cells got orgasmically excited by the tons of LURVE magazine’s inspirational images. And here I am, after less than a month, your own crowned domestic Queen,  in my house,  featured in its amazingness. What can I say…sometimes life surprises you…in the most beautiful way…

Thank you LURVE, thank you Lyna. I’m really honored.

These are unpublished stills from the shoot. You can see the feature here. More of it…tomorrow.

*Hybrid: Colette-crusade

completely beautiful shots and you ‘deliverer of awesomeness’ – happy birthday darling.x

Thankfifi

Empress Evangelie!

You are the one girl!!

What’s an end of season sale without an Alexander Wang stealthy acquisition? Miserable!The long-awaited object of desire, Lydia clutch in burgundy, finally reached its destination. My hands! But besides me, also my denim will have a rocking reason to celebrate themselves this Christmas… A new outstanding Wang made partnership!

You can find it in black here.

It’s perfection!!! Too bad I’m poor haha.

Hey nature lovers! You’re not alone anymore. Fashion florals are heating up this winter while simultaneously transforming us into moving gardens. Very Celine, isn’t it?

Wearing Zara shirt, Dannijo for Vena Cava necklace.

 

i LOVE the necklace!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Oh my, I love it! Very Celine indeed. Hey, which pants did your pair it with? (I need inspiration).
xoxo

With tailored cropped black pants and high heeled pumps..It was perfect!!!

I like the idea behind moving gardens, and the necklace you paired with this topper! Maybe I need my own garden soon? 😉

Gianvito Rossi boots/ M2Malletier bag. The boots on the video are Miu Miu.

Photography and video: Haris Farsarakhs

Fashion Editor: Evangelie Smyrniotaki

It’s almost that time of the year. 

The Christmas trees have already set up, the streets are aglow with fairy lights and compilations of seasonal songs slowly hit the radio stations(I don’t know about you but GOD…Someone to ban the stations that they do still play the unbearable autorepeating of “Last Christmas”, “Let it snow” or “Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer”. My ears are hurting!)

Let’s be honest, there’s nothing like Christmas guys and during that day all of us are secretly praying to crash on a pile of gifts upon entering our house. Isn’t it true? Well this year Net-A-Porter created the Holiday Shop to aim at ensuring this possibility, fantasy fashion rooms to choose your fairytale gifts, that is. 

During the following days, you’re gonna witness a series of editorials with my obsessions from these please-lock-me-inside rooms, starting with my favorite accessories, items that I’ve really wanted for a long, long time, these kind of accessories that you Can’t Go Wrong when you gift….Enjoy!

One of the most stunning faces I’ve ever seen, Spanish actress Astrid Berges-Frisbey in a dreamy wardrobe for the November S Moda. She wears the “if there was a Santa” glorious pieces from Chanel, Ungaro, Balmain and Marant. Enjoy!

And I’m not talking about hair. Hey style heroines. The depicted trend evidently claims the crown of the understated sexiness of the year. Deep cut on both sides this skirt doesn’t leave much to the imagination BUT used wisely, and when I say wisely I mean the upper body part generously disguised, could be proven one of your chicest outfits ever. Don’t forget that deep cuts add a little magic to your legs.  In fact they act as the fashion’s illusionist as they slim and lengthen them. I’ve said magic not miracles girls, the results are only temporary.

Wearing Zara skirt, YSL Opium pumps.

Loving this trend 😉

XX,
Miranda

Hi dear
Love this photo. Really stylish

  Wearing LNA tee, Zara TRF shorts, Diane von Furstenberg Tonda clutch. The bracelets are my moms(similar here and here).

I know what you are thinking. How the hell does she squeeze all her stuff in a tiny box. Am I a witch or what? That’s a very rational question, from a little cookoo readers, common I’ve seen your bags… You bring your entire house with you (Mothers are excused). Why? There must be a dirty little secret inside…Do tell. What’s in your huge bags anyway?

So, I’m a more keeping up with the essentials type. My mobile, a card wallet, a lip gloss and my keys, only if I’m not vacationing in Cambodia again, or else I’ll need my house and yours as well. This trend really works fantastically for me. The transition from night to day clutch happens with the addition of a delicate chain. Isn’t it wonderful how it transforms a beach style into a city look? In love…

Below is my little research with favorite ones. Behold.

i want them all! beautiful selection, ev!

j

Oh, classy yet comfy = perfect.
YET, I demand more photos of this outfit ! 🙂

I do love this bag, and the juxtaposition of the tiny delicate chain and dressy nature of it with the oversized casual tee and distressed denim. The color of the bag is perfection as well Ev 🙂 

Much <3

Ps- How is your weekend going? I hope you are getting some lovely weather in your part of the world.

    Wearing Isabel Marant pants and boots.

Today let’s look ahead and talk about hunches, and you know as I am an extremely emotional person, hunches are my most precious styling advisors.

Well now, maybe the frivolous fringes of Isabel Marant boots didn’t speak to your aesthetic but you shouldn’t disagree that they were big this season. For me it was the pure magnetic attraction that left me no choice than having these stunners, an act that eventually did destroy my bank account. But counting on future and just a couple of months before they get shelved, I was questioned myself: Will the fringes be in fashion the next winter or I’ll look like the Pocahonta’s estranged sister? Re: NO and YES. The yes goes for the cartoon aspect leaving me no choice than looking for the best big thing (shaving the fringes is prohibited).

Lord praise Givenchy’s pre-fall 12 collection which something tells me, the hunch that we previously discussed, that provided the fashion world with the next winter’s ultimate accessory. The evolution of perfection. Riccardo Tisci’s boots with the heel-covering sheaths are more refined and less rebelous than the Marant’s ones but remember me, the thorns on their sides will definitely stick in the top spot of your next winter’s wish list.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Wearing Marc by Marc Jacobs satin-trimmed pants, Isabel Marant jacket, Gianvito Rossi pumps.

BB stands for blazer blouse, phrase completely credited to my remained dysfunctional brain cells, alas the win win gesture!

The usual thick rigid blazer is replaced by a lightweight crepe one, in order to get tucked in our fancy pants. Please acknowledge that this bold but elegant trend demands massive amounts of Hollywood Tapes. Yeah girlfriends, nipple freaks are so over. 

lovely idea and, gosh, it looks SO good on you (really laughed with the h’wood tapes tip)

you are totally rocking this look. i am in love with your givenchy cuff!

Hey weekenders!!! How are you doing so far? I’m spending my last “Groundhog day”. Does the title ring a bell to you? If not a greek free translation might help: the marmot day. It’s the movie where Bill Murray finds himself living the same day over and over again. Uhhhh. Boredom. One thing is for sure. Here i’m having the rest of my life.

Wearing Acne denim, H&M shirt and cape. The hat is my daddy’s gift from Munich.

your cape rocks….

Bill Murrey made it out of ”Groundhog day” and so will you very very soon ;-)…

Hey cuties. Double or triple layer, be a human onion, because you know it has started to chill outside and we don’t want to get a cold…ok? In Teen Vogue‘s November issue there’s an excellent editorial, shown above, with awesome winter layerings including pieces from Alexander Wang, Isabel Marant, Marc Jacobs and others. But on the other hand I’m wondering how on earth could a teen afford them? Damn.

PS. I’m in love with the first picture’s Michael by Michael Kors wool coat and to see how good i am you can find it here.

I don’t know about you, but for me a pair of statement pants, sky hight booties, a tee and a leather jacket complete perfectly my ultimate Saturday night outfit. And if I could instantly have my dreamy pants for this night, they would be these.

Have a great, super, fantastic Saturday night.

Hello world! It’s “Clean Monday” in Greece and by the time you read this post I’ll be already fat! No, no,no… “clean” unfortunately is not the day that the population is  mass detoxing via ala Paltrow juicing. No, no,no.  Huge name conflict.  It’s the date of upgrading to rounder figures through the insane consumption of lagana(bread) and halva(sweet confection). By the way if you ever hear someone call you “halva”….it’s not good!

On an unrelated note I  honestly believe I was Asian in my past life. No joke. Gimme me a kimono, a dozen of shrimp and pork dumplings, a one way ticket to wherever on the east side and I’m the happiest girl in the word. The triplet of joy. And speaking of kimonos behold the goosebumps producing machine I’ve mentioned in a previous post. The one I briefly held in my arms in Dries’ Paris-store, cried a river and drowned the whole world when I was told that was the last piece and already sold and flew to the moon at the hearing of it could be ordered from Belgium and delivered to my hotel-room within two days. Universal commerce if you will but my mind was completely unaware of this new reality. A credit card ready to get assassinated and all at your doorstep. Eeeeeee-haaaaa!

 

Absolutely stunning! I’m so glad I found your blog. Your posts are so simple and extremely high quality. Not to mention I’m head over heels for Dries…

http://thesoph-isticate.blogspot.com

As usual stunning Photography great Model

Oh. It’s you. This kimono and you, in black & white, here : http://www.flickr.com/photos/frglme/8534822638/in/photostream/lightbox/

I love kimono!

The stripes are the stable, the colour is the variant. Yeah, the joy was double from Singapore! In this fashion equation I was wondering which of the two you like the most? Red or white? Have a rocking Friday night!

This look is amazing

Great outfit, I love it. Lucky you are able to wear sandals in December!

With a jumpsuit or not total looks will be worn wildly the upcoming season. I myself am a sworn fan of this trend. Today I’ve chosen for you an amazing editorial fromVogue Russia with the 16-year-old American model Hailey Clauson, yes your eyes are reading the correct number, captured by Terry Tsiolis, wearing Balmain, Stella McCartney and Emporio Armani. Edgy but really beautiful and sexy. My kind of total.

After a long, painfully long session with my dentist, multiple posing seemed like the Mission Impossible Saga. But I figured you may have been interested in an unposted outfit from my recent trip to Paris. It’s my newest addition, a denim shirt from COS  with this extremely interesting detail on it’s sleeves. Very Celine don’t you think?

Sweatpants from Nowhere.

PURE perfection !! Need the Cos shirt !

This look of yours is right up my alley! COS has some lovely pieces. Totally in love with your denim shirt!!

Wearing Acne distressed denim skirt, Etoile Isabel Marant hoodie(again mytheresa links are…ill, the jacket exists,  go to the IRIS WOVEN HOODIE), Kain tank, Gianvito Rossi pumps, Phillip Lim clutch (sold out but check out this….Nice?)

Fine trash…another proof that fashion has the psychedelic unpredictable nature of a woman…

The rules have bended guys  and a totally ripped off midi length denim skirt paired with a simple sporty hoodie can be a bad-ass chic Saturday night fine dining’s outfit. But in order the look to function properly, note on these two important details: Bare legs and killer heels…Oh yes my girls, I know you’ are brave, aren’t you?

Oh this is really nice & love the style of your photo’s & yeah! nice blog! 😉

Parka Marni/Jumpsuit Heroine By Tom Wood.

Ph George Angelis

I certainly don’t belong to the layer-league, that is the very private women-only club in which entrance is guaranteed If you layer like an onion and still look good. Thus I have to wear something, one single unit, that is not an outdoor heater and can actually keep me warm during the coldest days. I’m talking about parkas the biggest invention after the wheel. Polymorphic, adjustable and absolutely chic when worn over dresses. Below you can find my kinda endless parkas’ list because nobody wants to freeze in the corner..

Wearing Sonia by Sonia Rykiel silk joggers ( similar here), Chaser t-shirt, YSL Opium pumps.

It was only a matter of time until this trend hit the stores, a trend that my previously compressed from the skinny denim legs, have million reasons to celebrate!

And behold my dearests, the loose fit silk joggers, because you know track pants can can go the fancy way too and be simply…silk! I’ve added a stamped t-shirt to give the outfit an even sportier look and my YSL bi-colour pumps to prove to you that I’m slightly cookoo…That’s all folks!!!

I love it! Great inspiration 🙂

 Wearing Isabel Marant Temo crocheted cotton T-shirt, Current Elliott grey boyfriend denim(find them in a fantastic summer-blue here), Jimmy Choo fringed bag(similar and awesome here), Alaia sandals.

Just because you’ve asked to share with you the whole outfit of the, only detail meant to be, previous  post,   yesterday I’ve taken  pretty much the same sartorial choices,  differentiating the colour of the “flying spaghetti” top, for a brave stroll by the beach in the middle of a damn frustrating, sick whirlwind. So that’s it guys, behold a redemptive post, that in another life would have been called “crochet and boyfriend”. Don’t you ever tell me that I don’t love you…

Hi,

I just discovered your blog… And I already love it!

I like your atmosphere and mood…

❋The adventures of a fashion designer…
http://blog.valentineavoh.com

I absolutely love this! every element together is so different, but the overall look is amazingly elegant.

Just got this Isabel Marant top and can’t wait to wear it.  I am such a sucker for both of her lines, not to mention her shoes and jewelry.  I even have my own personal shop helper in NYC’s Soho shop who I call when I can’t find an item on the West Coast and even one in the flagship store in Paris who has shipped me items like the deliciously beaded and braided jackets from a few years back.  Can you tell I am obsessed?

Looks great, such a special shirt ! 

http://www.tripsandtreasures.net
new outfit post !

gorgeous back and front detail of the top and heels!

i love the top 🙂

I really like your hair like this very simple chic and of course i loooooove your t shirt in every color you get it!!

An amazing detailed top! The heels are a great orange accent to the outfit!

 Persol folding sunglasses.

And if you were thinking that my folding Ray-Bans would only be separated from my face by surgical removal behold their successors. Also function as the autobots of sunnies yet still refined and elegant structured like their predecessors. It’s a love. Period!

A sneak peek of Louis Vuitton’s precious accessories. Pointy toes and ladylike handbags in one “back to the future” collection. My personal favorite the apricot clutch with the white details, the sporty note in an ultra feminine, nostalgic show. We love you Mr Jacobs.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Wearing Topshop denim shirt, Current Elliot jeans, Boutique cashmere navy coat, currently sold out but you can find the same wool one in camel here, Alexander Wang booties, Phillip Lim clutch.

Hey loves. After some serious time, rain happened in Athens and what’s the best way to celebrate it except from a memorable rain dance? A navy wool cozy coat. Blue for the blues.

I must confess, it was disheartening searching for the perfect outerwear of this massively flattering shade, without that breaking my bank account. You see I’m the type of girl who crazily spends her money preseasonally so when the sales are around the corner I’m left with the fading memories of my glorious shopping past and my empty pockets.

After drooling and drooling over dozens of lovable navies, continuously re-memorizing my mom’s constricting lessons of self-control and cursing for the previous absence of it,  Boutique  offered me a solution that rocked. Boxy like McCartney’s stunners, cashmere fabricated like the Burberry Prorsum’s ultimate overalls, the reasonably priced Topshop designer’s coat, was a big, a big win! I knowI get lucky sometimes but onto what’s more important, if you were disciplined  during the season, I have for you the best navy outerwear of the market, and if you live in the US some of them are on SALE! Enjoy!

From left: Etoile Isabel Marant, ACNE, Stella McCartney, A.L.C, Paul & Joe Sister, Topshop.

This outfit is so relaxed and cool, love it. And I would love the coat from Paul And Joe as well.

This post has nothing to do with trends and fanciness. It’s only about the basics, the essentials, the pieces we desperately need to complete perfectly every single outfit. Looking at my photo I was stricken by the though of how many times I’ve needed the right white tank to wear with these leggings and I couldn’t find a single one in my closet. I know, we all get blinded by the popping colours, the bling and the crazy patterns leaving zero to spend more. But we have to set the priorities guys, and these are the basics.   Enter the above photo. Yes sure my boots are  blinding flashy, but ignore them, for the moment. So a good winter season traditionally starts with a pair of leather leggings. Essential like your bra, could be worn literally with ANYTHING. Going up to the cropped mohair black knit. Come on, the only thing that doesn’t look good with it are the harem pants. Hello Salome! Imagine how beautifully a white shirt’s collar could peep out of its hem prepping the whole outfit. Genial! Last but not least the jersey top. Your savior. Covering bellies, shielding the itchy knits, and worn with about a billion ways this is a true fashion staples. Not enough? Well below I’ve picked for you the ultimate baladeurs, the basics of the basics, the foundation of a dreamy wardrobe. Enjoy!



1. Acne shearling jacket, 2. Crumpet cashmere sweater, 3. Ileana Makri evil eye ring, 4. Givenchy Obsedia messenger, 5. T by Alexander Wang tank, 6. Christian Louboutin Pigalle, 7. Helmut Lang leather leggings

And don’t forget that  Alexander Wang has built an empire on the logic of the necessary simplicity with his T line, no no no you can’t be rich by them but you can shop smart, foxy smart.

I am wearing H&M PU leggings and cropped knit, Topshop jersey knit, Isabel Marant boots, oversized crocodile clutch from Bangkok.

Love the black leather pants! That’s the kind of style I like!

Wow, ur gorgeous!!! And your style is amazing!

Love your blog! <3

LOVE this outfit, babe! I will feature it on my blog today, hope you don’t mind!
I was wondering if the leggings are bought recently? They look amazing. My real leather trousers get baggy after some time wearing it, so i’m kind of looking for the perfect pu leather leggings. Thanks! X

Hi beautiful Cindy,
Of course I don’t mind. The leggings were bought a month ago, but they still have them. Take them the smallest you could fit, to have the looks you want!
By the way I love your blog…

Those leather leggings are for sure a fall/winter staple… actually a great pair of any type of leggings (black duh) is a necessity!

Wearing Levi’s Made & Crafted jumpsuit, YSL pumps, Givenchy Obsedia cuff, Chanel Boy bag.

Don’t you ever tell me that I don’t love you or that I don’t care for you. The piece that every style conscious girl should have in her closet is currently on sale and if you get rushed it could be yours.  The denim all-in-one from Levi’s Made & Crafted is an incredible sexyfier(I should ask for this word’s credits), a wardobe savior, for the difficult days that the brain cells don’t operate good enough for mixing clothes and a promising workwear if a dirty mechanic comes in your way begging for your help. Lol. Now that we’ve got a little more personal…I’ve found mine… not mechanic, not dirty but definetely my other half.My man.  How about you? Have you found the one? Or the two? Whatever!

You can find it here and here.

 



nice look

you are rocking this denim jumpsuit!

you look so unbelievably stunning, and the jumpsuit is perfect on you.

I have good friends and you know I always listen to them…So my 5 in  the morning decision for the previous posted photo didn’t seem to have warm welcoming from them. Well, Christine, one great advantage of blogging is that you can change everything and whenever you want. Putting aside my previous scary pale face, this one is for you! Ok? Ok!

Wearing Isabel Marant denim trench( through this link go to the Isabel Marant products in My Theresa even it says unavailable it excists, it’s the Alek coat, I don’t know why the link is doing that or find it in Zilly clothes if you live in Greece), Current Elliott boyfriend jeans, Isabel Marant belt, Acne tank, Gucci zebra pumps.

 Yes my dear Charlotte, you should immediately dig out your old H&M denim trench from the back of your closet. The minimalistic and sexy shapes of these coats will be big for this spring.

So do give a try, add some fanciness with lightweight denims to the rebel silhouettes and you’ll get impressed…

Dear Ev,

This mix of outfit is amazing, i have always love trench coats and the fact that it is navy-ish blue is even making me gone crazier!! haha!, you’ve made the outlook look comfy ease and relaxed with those denim hems rolled up.. Great mixture!

Sincerely,
Rebecca @ styleantagonist.blogspot.com

Hey party-goers! What’s your plans for the night? Whatever you do dress warm, I don’t want you to get a cold like me, ok? Ok! Now let’s talk about my outfit. What I’m usually saying and trying to commit to it, is that when you want to sport a piece that is loud  enough to make impression leave it alone!  With everything else simple,  your protagonist will  shine out and you’ll avoid looking overloaded. Of course there are times when mixing patterns create beautiful outcomes but I usually prefer to give the needed attention to the ones that deserve it. Obviously today’s epicenter is this Dion Lee printed extravaganza. I teamed it up with a plain oversized Topshop knit, Wolford opack tights and my Alexander Wang killer booties. Did it steal the lights or what?

My clutch is 3.1 Phillip Lim.

Fantastic look! You look stunning. Really like your sense of style. xx

I love, love, love this look!! The skirt is amazing…and I agree, when rocking a piece like that you don’t need much else going on with your ensemble to look oh so chic 😉

XX,
Miranda

Those booties!!

Great evening look, you look fab!

Acne sweater/ Zara scarf(similar here)/ Calvin Klein Collection skirt/Ann Demeulemeester boots(similar here)/L.G.R sunglasses.

Ph George Angelis.

These days when the topic of serial killer is brought up most people think of the latest “American Horror Story”, a very intriguing horror show, if I may…BUT in our case the storyline is completely different, my intentions are humble,  : I’m just referring to my Ann boots guys!

-Ohhhhh not again?!

I know, I know….the nast-ies haunted you the whole previous fashion year, walked approx 583 miles yet still are my favorites, the ones that practically match even with the craziest granny-outfit I wear…For what is worth…look up…down…and back. This time you have my permission…because smart girls never look back!



Evangelie… You look stunning, as always. Every time i read/see your posts, I feel so proud of you being Greek!

Sunglasses/Sheriff & Cherry     tee/Helmut Lang    jacket/Dries Van Noten     denim/Current Elliott    booties/Saint Laurent     bag/Chanel
Photo by Charlie Makkos.

Canned: Prerecorded and therefore considered to be lacking in freshness.

Cause it’s always been the same old scene: My eagle eyes spot the amazingness in store, I’m so love striken, my absurd mega-me insists that I need it to my life, my rational mini-me to give it a second thought, David beats Goliath, I return home, I can’t get it out of my mind, inevitably I lose my sleep, the very next morning I rush to buy it, excitedly I welcome it home, I sleep with it, literally, by my side…I swear,  the wear-to death marathon officially begins and after three weeks into this, I’m bored outta my mind. This is it. Kaput. Divorce. Why don’t you believe me? I’m telling you it’s a birth defect. It happens all the time. Over and over. Take for example the depicted Sheriff & Cherry yellowish sunglasses. I saw them at Colette and I immediately spoke the “want you” words, resigning them to their fate. It’s been over a week now and I still haven’t put them off. From day to-night, yes the extra light-colored lenses permit this extravaganza. But I’m afraid that when the honeymoon phase is over, I hate to say it, the  Kardashian-Humphries saga will set a court date…..

 

 



chic and comfortable!
I can’t take my eyes of your chanel!
Have a nice lazy Sunday!

Wearing Current Elliot denim, Chanel Boy bag, Givenchy Obsedia cuff, Isabel Marant jacket and belt, Acne tee. My rings are bought from Cambodia.

One could probably argue that it’s pointless spending on accessories, thing that I highly disagree. They are the only mean to elevate an outfit and should always be magnificent or else avoid them.  So on my recent trip, instead of filling my suitcase with pointless piles of clothes I’ve decided to go large with accessories and invest in my long time desires. I’ve strategically started with Chanel. Let me tell you a quick story about this.  After I sandwiched myself among dozens of Chinese outside the brand’s boutique at Galleries Lafayette for about half an hour, I couldn’t believe my luck when the seller told me that she was having the last Boy bag in Paris. Redirecting my focus to the cashiers to pay for it, there were two hysterical middle-aged women who grabbed my bag, insisting to keep it for themselves. It was that rare moment that my inner bitch found the chance to shine. Needless to say that in two seconds everything have returned to their normal state. The bag was finally mine. The next day laughing with the previous parody and exploring my little treasure I’ve found in the inner pocket the price tag and it was 200 Euros cheaper than I have paid. WTF?  Are they auctioning  the Chanels? Evidently there was a mistake and I wouldn’t leave it like this. I went with the bag to Rue Cambon, the brand’s flagship store, to check with the manager the real price and yes I’m officially the first person in the world that Chanel paid back money( 200€). Mistake or not and after walking half the town, there are these two things stuck in my mind: Don’t trust anyone and always double-check!



Those accessories look stunning on you! I

chanel

it s exactly watt i want 

a new bag channel like yours 

love it

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

  IRO flashing Anabela leather jacket.

Now that Jupiter, the planet of luck, has entered Jemini, there also will  be some fairly exciting benefits brought to us, the totally mellow, deeply weird Pisces . And talking about exciting, see the super hot IRO goodies that arrived at my door yesterday, from their upcoming winter collection. Aren’t they fantastic? What’s your favorite? Tell tell tell.

ps. If you’re living in Greece you can find them at Zilly stores in the near future.

These are lovely! I’m in love with the blue jacket!

But I wonder, did the brand send those to you?

by the way, love your blog/style!
XXX Olivia.

Fabulous! I love all of these – the colour of that jacket is beautiful. Thanks for introducing me to this brand I’m gonna be keeping an eye out for it. I’m a fellow pisces – good to know I have some luck coming my way  : )

Kate xo

IRO has been one of my favorite designers the past 2 years. The sheer blouse with zipper is a perfect blend of soft and hard, and the denim shirt reminds me of one I have that was last season’s APC and is still one of my favorite go-to tops.

you lucky thing, that blue jacket is perfect!

I genuinely love them all – every photo I scroll down to looks better than the last – can’t wait to see how you style them and if you don’t want any of them… send them my way!

♥ ThankFifi

Blue blouse is my favorite!!!!!!!!Lucky girl!!

Only for tough chicks. I like my jewelery to have an attitude, a dynamism, a story to say. Tom Binns is my latest designer crush, my dreamy narrator in the most rocking fairytale in the style universe. Favorite, the pyramid silver ring, a lethal weapon by its own if you like.

You can find them here and here.

love the skull pendant…

Wow it is all I can say!!!! The rings are fabulous!

Acne Jacket/Acne pants/ Michael Kors cardigan/L.G.R sunglasses/Fratelli Rossetti shoes(similar here and here)
Ph George Angelis

Remember when the clubs were fun? I (almost) tend to forget it.

So it’s Saturday night, the only big night of the week the 20-year old  me used to go out, the only night of the week the depicted me stays at home to avoid shrouded in a haze of cigarette smoke(yes we still do smoke right in your face in Greece).

From airplane directly to the keyboard, after a flash business trip to Monaco(get ready for an avalanche of latergrams) showcasing my biggest yet love for this winter. When suited, coat with a cardigan. It’s absolutely, freaking clash of styles and that might be the extra reason of loving it more. A chunky warm piece, to protect your sharp shoulders from the winter tap. Needless to say that the Acne suit is my soft spot for this season…I’m sure you’ve already got it!


Love this game

Looking great as usual!

I’ve searched you in the sky, I’ve found you on earth. Season’s most luscious colour and the most desired pattern in one piece. This emerald snakeprint knit dress feels so Isabel Marant meets Phillip Lim and it’s only a humble Zara. Killer choice and an ultimate savior, for my currently pale complex. I’ve caught a cold guys, and I tend to look like a Dita von Teese without the lipstick. Aaachoo! Bless me!

Also wearing Etoile coat, Ash booties. 

 

 

is this from the current Zara collection? love/

Yes, it’s absolutely fresh! 😉

This color looks amazing on you 🙂 I hope you are feeling better love!

Photos by Charlie Makkos.
It’s three in the morning and the completely crazy lady who writes for this blog, is doing superhuman efforts, just to stay awake and make up with you. I’m sorry for the absence of posts but I’m in Paris and most of the stores don’t carry the SS collections yet and I’ve had high expectations and I haven’t found anything to break my world and I’m running like chicken without a head and my feet get these horrible cramps all the time and it’s freezing cold  and I’ve accidentally broke a bottle of water by the bed and I have tiny glass stuck in my foot and I think tomorrow I’ll have my period…and….I love you….:)

Love it!

Most perfect bag EVER !

 Wearing Tibi top, Phillip Lim pants, Alexander Wang sandals, Chanel Boy bag.

When the cosmic forces reunite just to struggle your Wi-Fi, this is what happens: two days of full, annoying silence. But I’m back. Meanwhile the usual cropped top, a trend I continue to circulate, got longer and the pants’ waistline lower. A perfectly balanced equation for the extreme low-rise Lims to get airy and merry***

thanks so much for the advice – could you tell me what size you usually take in jeans? I’m about to order the pants but don’t want to get it wrong as they don’t accept refunds on sale items! Thanks in advance for your help!

My usual size is 26-27…
<3

love love love the pants – did you find they sized normally. What size did you get? Just found them on sale and not sure what size to go for! TIA

Hi Tia,
thay need to be a little baggy so I’ve got them in size 4 my normal size. They’re awesome.

Credits for the jewerly?

Hi Beatriz, ofcourse, the two gold bracelets belong to my mother, the red rope is a prayer rope from Cambodia, I also wear an evil eye from Lalaounis.The ring and the little skull bracelet from Ileana Makri.

your top is fabulous and your pants look amzing on you!
xoxo

those pants are great!

  Booties/Saint Laurent    denim/Current Elliott    shirt/Stella McCartney    blazer/Stella McCartney(also here)     bag/Saint Laurent (via LuisaWorld)

Photos by Charlie Makkos.

Bonjourrrr…And what a beautiful day that is. Go out, break the ice,  photosynthesize a bit, blossom  your precious mind-plants and think productive ways to defreeze the upcoming vicious( and frustrating) cold. I suggest..to hug. Meeting point: Jardin des Tuileries. Crowd: The blogosphere insanity. Once we’ll form a giant shapeless circle, we’ll squeeze-to love Tommy Ton in the middle. Impossible to escape, no?

On an unrelated note fashion geniuses, cleverly invented a whole new range of shades to infuse the spring collections with a fresh, rejuvenating scent. Polar a.k.a icy shades. So cool(literally). Apparently I was caught in the net. Your little fish loves blues. Particularly unsaturated winter blues. See I can still wear a some kind of frivolous colour without being grumpy:).

Waow ! Love the booties

J’adore the light blue blazer and shirt mixed with the jeans. xRomi

love the shirt and blazer together, so chic

http://www.tripsandtreasures.net

the colours of this outfit are amazing! love it!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Wearing Etoile Isabel Marant skirt, Chaser top, Jerome Dreyfuss bag, Isabel Marant boots (if you’re living in Greece you can find them at Zilly stores)

In a country that has the most magnificent weather in the world, when the sun unexpectedly shines in a winter Sunday and your whole body feels that spring is rising, a proud country that gifted the mankind with the words democracy and ethos, δημοκρατία και ήθος, this same country is the one that has the most unthinkable enemies: it’s habitants.

Corrupted politicians or masked idiots one thing’s for sure…They burn their own history, their city, our lives. It’s a shame.

 

Hello,
I love how you find new combinations for your Marant boots! I have them too, and I wondered how you keep them clean? I also would like to know what size of top you are wearing as I am thinking of getting it too 😉 You are an inspiration…
Love
tinneke

Hi Tinneke, thank you so much…
So how do I keep them clean… there are these little shops who fix heels( I don’t know how they’re called) which if they’re good they can clean them for you. That’s for the suede part of the boots that is the most difficult one and i think you shouldn’t try by yourself. For the leather part I clean them with the clean wipes that gave me with some leather chairs I’ve got in the past..If they’re good for my white chairs they’re good for my boots..You can easily find leather clean wipes in the market so don’t worry…Aaaa…and I wear small;-)

Hey style heroines! Does this jumpsuit ring a bell to you? Yes, you’ve seen it in an olive colour in a previous post. Well, two years prior I was so obsessed with overalls, to the point to get them multiplied. I still do, I believe they’re the easiest, sexiest and the most stylish outfit that anyone could sport but due to these grey economic times, damn crisis, now one is more than enough.

Wearing Isabel Marant jumpsuit, Prada jacket (fall 10), Alexander Wang booties, Jerome Dreyfuss Bobi bag.

HOT  chicka!!!!!!!

You rock the jumpsuit so well! And I love the detailing on your jacket 🙂

XX,
Miranda

I love your booties

A.P.C skirt(also check out the pants)/A.P.C knit/Celine booties/Gucci bag/L.G.R sunglasses.
Ph George Angelis

It might feel rigid at the beginning but give it a few sit-downs and I promise you’ll forget it even exists!

And when you do…I mean really forget it’s existence….please DON’T bend!

The images got shot before the aforementioned sit-downs thus the lower part of my outfit was stiff as hell. That’s the raw denim guys, trending hugely after Nicolas Ghesquière‘s S/S collection for Louis Vuitton. If you are not familiar with the wording they are the jeans that are not washed after having been dyed during production. Thus their deep blue color that did find their perfect mate on the softest angelique hued knits. The depicted one from A.P.C, per me, is one of the best (until now at least) outthere because it’s actually white and not the yellowish cousin of the so wanted shade like the majority in the market.


So be it guys, opposites attract…I know…you haven’t quite learned yet….



Such a simple but effective look, like your styling! x

Such a lovely outfit!

 Wearing  Isabel Marant  Lamy Hooded Jacket, T by Alexander Wang top, Current Elliott boyfriend denim, Zara belt, Isabel Marant Rea sandals, Topshop aviators.

With a more “searching my boat” and less “blinding by the sun” expression, I salute the newest ultra stylish sporty hybrid after the baseball jacket. The sailing jacket. Surely more frivolous and definitely a lot more summerish than it’s predecessor, It’s brilliantly attached with a  massive orangy  hood, enough to transform you to a one of its kind butterfly species babe. Oh yeah…I think I can fly….

I absolutely love everything about this. JUST LOVE LOVE LOVE. Girl, you embody the exact look I love but have yet to track down inspiration. Thank you for inspiring me. xx

THIS IS INSANE.. the jacket is so perfect!! 

xo Nicol

I can’t put it in words how much I like this outfit and the pictures. You have such a great attitude in those!!

The first one is my favourite!!

Can u tell which nail polish you’re wearing?
It’s the perfect shade of white.

Xxx

Hi Hansel, it’s called instant hot and it’s from Essie 🙂

Love your jeans and shirt.

Beautiful Outfit. Beautiful pictures. Beautiful you!

Love Storm

  Heels/Celine    shirt/Anine Bing      pants/Isabel Marant    bag/Saint Laurent (via LuisaWorld)

Photos by Charlie Makkos

In a reminiscing mood, today I’m channeling my grandma’s hacienda, if really existed( a hacienda not a grandma), kitchen wall tiles with these floor-sweeping flares for which I’d like to pose a question to Mrs Marant:  For what women’s height are they made for? Because If my calculations are correct, a whole 1.72 me + 12.5 sky-high heels=wait…..my iphone says 184.5cm….karlie Kloss with flats, if you will….and still replacing every single’s street sweeper’s job around the capital…Pffff…the new generation is so tall….:)

These pants are incredible and I know you’re just like me, you know they’re too long but you love the look and you know it’s impractical to sweep the street but you just don’t care!  I’m wearing my super long pants in this weekends post and podering the same length issues as you but, no, I will not shorten them either!

Thankfifi

Mixing so many styles together, has never been funnier. Sporty x Ethic x SM and I pronounce the outcome SES. The SM refers to the choker. Not just any choker though. The Dannijo x Vena Cava. Oh yes my dear readers I’ve just received it and I literally want to style it with everything. And here how it went today.  An ethnic patterned Isabel Marant tiny skirt smartened up with a J.Crew boyish sweater and the simple Acne bootie-wedge hybrid. SES ROCKS!!!

PS: my wristlet is  Phillip Lim.

 

Such an attractive piece, beautiful!

That’s a silver one, right?

I’m currently thinking of getting gold one but this silver is just uuuh

You styled it great, again beautiful 🙂

how beautiful you are……

I love this look and the necklace is beautiful!

bertieeeeeee <3 love..

Wearing IRO jumpsuit, Gucci pumps, Kenneth Jay Lane earings.

At the risk of wasting my deeply frozen brain juice on finding a massive Saturday outfit mix, I’ve decided to go more minimalistic by sporting this fabulous jumpsuit from my beloved French designer IRO. It’s a lux, silk piece, surprisingly comfy yet understated sexy, a wardrobe staple that I’m sure I’ll reference back for maaaany years!

It’s exactly three in the morning here soooo nighty night my loves!

very elegant! the jumpsuit is adorable!
xx
SurfAddictFashionista

Dear Ev,

Wow! Tassel earings is my favourite inspiration for now.. Love this look of your’s and may i say that you looked a little like Kate Beckinsale here..

Sincerely,
Rebecca @ styleantagonist.blogspot.com

The jumpsuit is amazing !  And so are the pics ! love the second and the fourth one, they look like movie pictures.

It was only a matter of time before a trend bring to the light one of the most stupid things I ever done. My belly piercing. I’m telling you guys there’s no way back from this. You’re condemned to live with two holes on your abdomen for your entire life. Damn girlhood…Apart from this I’ll have to admit that the understated sexy aesthetic of a cropped chunky top with a high-waisted denim totally worth any unfavorable exposure.

OHHHHHH MY GOD, darling!!!!!! I have been working like crazy during the last 2 months….you are amazing, again, as always!!!Miss u style godess!!!

Fantastic outfit. Really like your shoes and the Chanel bag.
It looks amazing in black and white. Have a Chanel obsession myself 😉

Sometimes I really, really wonder if the things that I write make any sense. I know for fact that some people are better in body language(me,me,me) and probably should stay only on that but since this blog is a muted, non-animated form of communication, writing is the only way to save our marriage. Now seriously, I won’t lie to you, words don’t come easy for me. And I’ve never told you this before but I believe that I haven’t inherited the  “fluency” gene. I have though the “grumpy” and “greedy” ones.  But not the aforementioned. Occasionally I get some good mood boosts but overall I need time(a lot) to deliver my texts. Pffff…frustrating.

Anyways, can you recognize our old acquaintance on my back? Hmm? Yes, let’s open the champagne bottles guys, the paisley print is resurrected! And in its original form. No aerodynamic shape or minimal structure. The paisley as we know it. Cheers Mr Tisci!

 

brilliant !

This bomber jacket is just perfection.

wow wow wow babe! Love it!

cool jacket. love the saint laurent booties as well.

i always LOVE what you write and of course what you wear 😉 you know already i am your stalker haha 😀 that jacket is gorgeous!!

Charmed by your high quality aesthetics mirrored in your eloquence and choice of setting my lady! In terms of your writing skills I can totally relate it doesn’t come easy, but as a literary oriented soul, I can assure you, your writing is marvelous!

Ev, you write incredibly well, and I always enjoy all that you have to say. Thank you for sharing that with us. This outfit speaks volumes! Love that badass bomber jacket and then the shorts, tights, and those freaking cool new booties are the icing on the cake. Amazing hon!

xxTheresa

Acne Jacket/ Acne pants/ Fratelli Rossetti shoes(similar here and here)/ Zara scarf(similar here)/L.G.R sunglasses.

Ph George Angelis

Seven days is a long break for a blog. I’m not gonna excuse myself by telling you that I’ve had million things to do, so please forgive me, I will always love you bla, blah, bla.. No, no, no. My boss, who’s actually me, was expecting too much from Ev so I took a break, entered the free stress zone just before  my energy plummet. To be totally honest this unexpected epiphany came after one of the longest conversations Mara & I had during one of our evening strolls by the sea. I was inexcusably grumpy, complaining that I’ve been continuously tired and totally uninspired.  At that moment my friend suggested to deal with it professionally and like any other job to have at last a real break.  And she was right. Since 2011 I had never taken some time off  from blogging. Even when I’ve been on vacations, I’ve been having photo shoots , posting or even  discussing new collaborations. I was never absent. I have never hung the “do not disturb” tag. So for the past few days my fingers have been totally keyboard-free and the trial…is almost rejuvenating.

And I am back! Dressed like a wrapped gift, celebrating the return of the sharp tailoring. Yes, the timeless stylish shapes  have made a comeback putting the boxy ones to rest for a while. If you ask me(and my mom), it was about time to salute the  oversized elements. Something that we practically owe to the 70’s revival, if you  will. 

So bring the sexy back fashion! We missed it, lady.


 



Wow you look great, really love

Kiss kiss.*Jo

Όσο και αν οι boxy και oversized γραμμές μας άρεσαν και μας έκαναν να νιώθουμε άνετα και χαλαρά, νομίζω κι εγώ (και πιστεύω και ΟΟΟΟΛΟΙ οι άντρες αυτής της γης) πως ήταν καιρός για τα πιο θυληκά ρούχα να κάνουν ένα δυναμικό comeback. Πολλά φιλιά, mademoiselle-rania.blogspot.com
ΥΓ. Το δικό σου comeback είναι ακόμη πιο ευχάριστο!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

And while I was trying to answer the eternal question if there is a life after heels, I stumbled across  the above Alexander Wang‘s nearly flat sexifiers and my completely devastated feet saw their resurrection. So yes miracles do happen, and comfy shoes can sometimes be surprisingly flattering. The dirty secret is the ankle strap which helps the sandal to be enormously walkable while simultaneously it elongates the legs. Not bad eh?

Below are the rest of my favorite everyday low-heeled sandals…Enjoy!

1. Giuseppe Zanotti 2. Pierre Hardy 3. Jimmy Choo 4. Lanvin 5. Pierre Hardy 6. Alexander Wang 7. Sam Edelman 8. Chloe

Stunning shoes and perfect height!

They are indeed elegant and beautiful, and there is no need to find any thing extra because the style and design are not anywhere else.

In loooove, can’t wait to see you rocking these! Loving the pierre hardy ones as well! Hope you had a great weekend Ev 🙂
XO

Wow ! I’m just in love with these beauties !
We are still waiting for the sun, here in Paris…

Hey loves. I ought you my last day’s outfit and as far it concerns our relationship I never forger. For all the others I have the memory of a sparrow. Now back to my outfit i’ve sported my super fitted hybrid sweat pants from Nowhere, and the leftover of a diver’s winter suit. I’m just joking Mr J.W Anderson. You know that I have declared my love for you in the past, don’t you? My blue valentine clutch is a Phillip Lim and the pointy toes are from Prada.

The pants are amazing!!! Perfect styling – Sport chic 😉

Fantastic!

You look gorgeus in those Nowhere pants! And just like Miranda, I have pants that I really need some guiding in how to style. And ofcourse you deliver!! 😉 

xox
Cecilie

I have some grey pants that I am trying to decide the best way to spice up a bit, and this is such an inspiration that I need to maybe throw in something unexpected…And fun.

XX,
Miranda

Wearing Etoile Isabel Marant lace top, H&M PU pants, Isabel Marant biker jacket, River Island booties, Celine Phantom bag, Givenchy Obsedia cuff.

If you’re conflicted with the contradiction of the aforementioned words, keep in mind that in the endless fashion world exceptions happen and in fact they’re pretty darn good. For what it’s worth, I think a minimalistic lace top like the above, could surprisingly replace the versatility of a simple white t-shirt in a more refined, elegant way. But, everywhere there is a butt, with only one condition. To fall loosely over your body. Be generous with the sizing of your top and you know generocity always gives back at you….

Μοντερνα κομψό στυλ!

That’s the way uhuh  uhuh I like it! X

Maison Martin Margiela cropped knit/ MiH Jeans denim/ Balenciaga bag (and here)(available at FreeShop)

Ph George Angelis

Seriously you haven’t noticed? We are brand new, open 24/7. Styleheroine has a new face and a new body, a total lift, if I may. However during the next couple of days you will notice some additional changes as we undergo a transitional “baby” phase. And newborns…well they have diaper rushes or in common english minor issues which eventually will be resolved in the near future.

So now that I rung the bells, do tell. Like? Is the new layout good? Do you still love us?

Back to the sartorial purposes of this website, it might be freezing on the half of the hemisphere however my tummy is still standing strong towards the climate changes. Honestly guys I have a soft spot for all the fragile knits and by the word fragile I mean all the sweaters that don’t serve their original cause of existence. That is to keep us warm. Open backs, deep v or the depicted cropped knit all in my “adore” list. What I love most about this top though is its toned shoulders. Cleverly structured to restore the balance to the whole outfit that kinda breaks a totally naked waist.  The perfect proportions by always genius MMM…

 



 

So beautiful !

This Surface To Air asymmetric top, is unique even squeezed inside these leather shorts, don’t you think? And because in my country we have an idiom saying one equals to none, take it x3 to enjoy it.

Also wearing Maje shorts, ASOS cuff, YSL pumps.

love it

  Booties/Saint Laurent(you can also find them here and here)

Photo by Charlie Makkos

Nothing yet absolutely everything. The four words that constitute the pure essence of amazingness. In fashion. Because in relationships “nothing” sucks. Banned. Gimme the absolute zero and you’ll get the boot, not the depicted one, hold your horses. I’ll show you the door, got it? Back on track, supposedly you’re in a store and instead of the above bicolor concrete floor are chunky wooden shelves. What would you think about these booties? Too simple or at very least nothing special (in a closer look, you’d definitely see them as endangered species and savingly grab them, there’s no doubt about that, you’re flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood). And then you try them on and realize that whatever is going on with them is freakin’ awesome. Nothing becomes everything. That much-needed geniously crafted simplicity elongates your legs, sexify your ankles, and you suddenly visualize them fantastically matching with every single outfit in the world. Bonus points the absolutely walkable 8.5cm(I’ve just measured them, net-a-porter you’re wrong :)) heel. Invest!

I really need a pair of these!

Wearing Isabel Marant Kalas leather leggings-style pants Find them here and here), American Apparel Chiffon Oversized Button-Up, T by Alexander Deep V Bra, Isabel Marant Rea sandals, Jimmy Choo clutch.

Well I hadn’t realized that a tiny bit of trivia could so massively tease your intergalaxial imagination. Pregnant? Are you politely implying that I’m getting fatter? Common…don’t you see? My locks are gradually transforming  into a lighter more summerish shade. Even though almost everybody insist to stay committed to my brunette temperament, my crazy, wannabe Swedish, brain cells rather want to transform their protective shield into a blonde, peroxide blonde extravaganza. Is this an early mid-life crisis or just blondes have more fun?

 

Loooove for that bra/sheer combo. Bet it was too sexy from the front 😉 And if you’re fat than I should have been on a diet since I was 11, stop talking. Loving your hair!
XO

Ahah pregnant must be very frustrating to hear that! You didn’t get fat AT ALL. I think both will suit you, so why not go for a change!

LoL you don’t look pregnant. Whenever a girl tells me she has something to tell me I automatically guess that they are pregnant haha.

amazing!!!!! great style

Well, I would say no, BLONDES DO NOT HAVE MORE FUN! Quite the contrary, they have more nerve-wracking time trying to fix their extremely dry, deeply erased hair! And you know I know what I’m talking about! 🙂 So I would say no, don’t go for it for simple 4 reasons: 1) your hair will be totally damaged and even after dying it back to brown will still look and feel dry, 2) you will have to cut it more often, breakage and split ends will make it almost impossible to grow, 3) think you it would look kind of unnatural because of your dark skin and eyebrowes (it’s like i can’t imagine Emanuelle Alt as blonde either), 4) you look stunning as a brunette! 🙂 Just saying: THINK TWICE BEFORE DOING THIS! 🙂

Good morning guys…..The past two days I’m a little sick, I have a stubborn fever and a toothache. I think there might be a relevance between the two.Ughhhh…. I remember when I was ill as a child my mother always cooked my favorite dishes to make me feel better. Nowadays that I have to take care myself, in difficult situations like this I have invented my own ways to quickly fix my mood. One of them is wearing new acquisitions. Today I’ve tried my new metallic pants. Aren’t they amazing? They are perfectly cut for a very close fit, and their shine is discrete enough to avoid looking like a disco ball….I’ve added a simple green-ish black top to make the outfit a little more casual.

Wearing Zara trousers, Etoile Isabel Marant top.

 

 

the pants are amazing…did you buy them now?

It’s only a small busted girl’s advantage. All those years watching series like Baywatch (Pamela shaking her stuff around California) I’ve been confused about my very own “limited” growth. Wiser now and utterly compromised with my little imperfections, I’ve reached the conclusion that in this chic wonderful world, I’m absolutely lucky.

Wearing Stella McCartney jumpsuit, Chanel clutch.

 

ouaou!! Sooo beautiful! Love the dress xx

You look so gorgeous!! I love this look so…I am beginning to think there isn’t anything you can’t pull off.

XX,
Miranda

P.s- You are right, you are damn lucky to have those fringed beauties from Isabel Marant 😉

  Denim/J Brand knit/Michael Kors(here and here) via LuisaWorld   neck cuff/Sarah&Sebastian   bracelets/Cooee


Photos by Charlie Makkos.

Leason to be learned: Not all trends are for everyone.
It’s just two weeks before hitting PFW and on the lack of any outfit inspiration, i’d conviced myself(it wasn’t that hard though) to go with the (white)flow and give it a try. And when I say white I mean maaassive total winter white. How does it sound? Fantastically ideal, no? Not for me. Once those whites were on, oh boy, my head wanted to move to another body. A naked one. My skin’s olive tone popped out against the striking monochrome and I, poor me, you guessed it…looked like dead. Zombie-ish dead. Walking dead for god’s sake….
However when added the golden hues of the depicted Sarah & Sebastian neck cuff somehow everything tied together beautifully and I….could breath again….no, no, no…

Oh Evangelie, i adore your every outfit. Plus youre gorgeous! Possibly my most fav fashion icon. xx

Wearing Diane von Furstenberg oversized jacket, Etoile Isabel Marant top, Current Elliott leather pants, Gianvito Rossi pumps, Chanel Boy bag.

It’s the first time since Hugh Hefner’s 84 birthday that a man has received so massive wishes from beautiful women, and my proud as a peacock hubby made me swear to write a post about his grateful feelings. Well my awesome readers Alex THANKS you all for your fantastic wishes and I really, really love you!

And in that cheerful enviroment a glimpse of yellow neon looks just perfect. Discrete yet playful this latest trend is an absolutely rocking way to spice up your blazer’s monotony and far more favorable from a total neon jacket.

And to conclude, cool things don’t need to necessarily cost a fortune, as adding a pop coloured lining inside your old blazers is an easy DIY.  All you need is a sewing machine and you stitch the frivolous lining on the old one. That easy!

these photoshoot is amazing my ev
great job!
xoxo

i LOVE your blog! i never write comments, sorry for that, but your style is just PERFECTION! this jacket is so so soooo amazing! pop of color is just fantastic i must take your advice & do something like that with one of my blazers! lots of love, kate

Thank you Kate…welcome on board my love..

Love all your outfits! Love this bag, and this pants are gorgeous

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Puma x McQ sneakers(also in dusty pink)/Acne leather pants/ Acne coat(available at Freeshop)/ Joseph turtleneck(similar here)/ Bottega Veneta bag (available at Luisa World)

Ph George Angelis

And just like that our feet have been saved….

I mean it has been really hard for me to imagine sneakers that do fit like a puzzle piece to my own outfits. However the aforementioned past tense explains former situations because guys…how cool is the collaboration between king of chic McQ Alexander McQueen and the Puma !  Sleek leather and nubuck details balanced out with mesh.  Essential hotness if I may… Not to mention, to my mom’s delight, the playful rubber sole that adds a slice of color to my usual monochrome universe.

 

But really I have to ask….Where have you been all the previous fashion weeks? My arches would have been saved….

You can check out the whole collection of the Puma x McQ collection here.

 

 

Amazing photos!

Great look! I love sneakers and I’m so happy that the fashion world has embraced so we can all finally enjoy fashion week! I love wearing mine with tailored or lady like pieces, adds a great contrast x

Nice sneaks, this color combination is the best.
Even though I like sneakers, I usually don’t like how women wear them (too sporty for me, or they just look like teenagers).. but you! You make them look so damn good. Sporty chic at its best:)

That Bottega Veneta bag is beautiful!

Can you think  anything sexier than this option? Of course you’ll answer where’s the hotness in a masculine jacket but imagine it: Plain without the addition of unnecessary tops or even underwear for the daring ones, with only a statement necklace like a choker or a trendy collar. You like it now eh…. I love it too. Wear it over skinnies or leather leggings if you wanna rock the world. Get inspired more here  from net-a-porter’s tuxedo collection. Geia!

PS: Run to your nearest Zara store. Tuxedo jacket’s are their unquestionable hits.

Very chic!

Hey world! Yes, your eyes don’t lie. It has been a long time since you’ve seen me in a dress. I’ve wanted to feel a little restless. Not girly, don’t you ever again think this about me. Do you know what’s so special about this print extravaganza? There is not any single connotation associated with romanticism in it. It’s only for hard rock chicks who just want to have some fun. And you my girls are  the best of them!

PS. Big thanks to Charlie and Greg!

Wearing Isabel Marant dress( you can find it in white here or at Zilly if you’re in Greece), the same designer’s boots and the usual suspect Jerome Dreyfuss Bobi bag.

You look beautiful! Love the print on the dress. 

XX,
Miranda

Isabel Marant makes the best rock chic clothes without ever being romantic or girly girly, it´s just ubercool.

Pretty dress and once again great boots!!!

Hey little devils…Have you ever thought that a shoulder maximizer is a booty minimizer. Nice equation right? These are real mathematics but nobody teaches them at school. A strong shouldered jacket makes the proportions of the lower body seeming smaller comparing to the virtual wider upper one. Think about a swimmer’s body. Yeah, now you see….

Wearing Prada pointy toes, Topshop denim and hoodie, Kain blouse, Isabel Marant leather jacket, Jerome Dreyfuss bag.








Yum outfit! and i totally get your point about the shoulder maximizer equals booty minimizer. I should incorporate that in more of my outfits!

Let me introduce you to the best acquisition I’ve ever done in my entire shopping life. It’s this Isabel Marant fur coat bought from the designer’s Rue Jacob boutique, two years prior. It’s like a wardrobe chameleon which constantly saves me from every freaking winter night monotony. My ultra cozy glam factor. What’s yours?

Also wearing Surface To Air suede pants, J.Crew shirt, YSL pumps, Jimmy Choo clutch.

PS. If you really like it and desperately want it, I’ve found excactly the same here.

 

LOVE this outfit.  Are you able to advise where to get the pants from. Thanks

Hey Rebecca,
Thank you for your lovely comment. My pants are from the previous season so they don’t excist anymore. BUT i’ve found for you a similar one here http://www.net-a-porter.com/product/170420. If you find them too expencive, they are, pay a visit at your H&M local store because i’ve seen something similar. Hope i’ve helped.

I can’t decide which piece I love more…The fur or the suede pants. Love this!

Hey guys what’s smoking??? Wait, wait, don’t tell me that you’re staying home on a Saturday night? Go out and backstab every single snowman with your killer heels. I’m talking about you NY! Unleash your fanger*. Revenge Nemo!

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, have you noticed? There’s a new denim species in town. First there were the boyfriends and now…the grannies. High-waisted baggies straight out of the middle-age zone or else the answer to the entirely shitty “Where do you see yourself in twenty years” question*(*see above and below). But attractively evolved. Lowering the crotch does it seem attractive? Get it together, woman. You should definitely improve your English vocabulary(Mini-Me talking). Modernized, is that the exact word, no? The additional shot to stay forever young! That’s it.

Oh how we love our granny…:)

*hybrid: fashion-anger

Ps. There’s always one song continiously playing when editing a post. Always. Today’s one is old n’sexy like the afformentioned pants...Enjoy!

 

I love your style!!

*Canonization: the act of admitting a person into the canon of saints.

And just like that, experiencing  Saint Laurent’s seduction from head to (almost) toe, is the ultimate spiritual frenzy. Yes it is. Better than sex. Ok maybe i’m exaggerating completely a little bit but let’s be honest: If someone knows how to celebrate simplicity, then it’s this blog.

Hedi Slimane dared it. Dared to liberate the iconic house from it’s heritage.  That alone is worth applauding. Because even when you know that simplicity is the greatest ability, the common belief says that it’s not sartorial worthy. And there come the guts.

So less is more for SL and as to these skin tight skinnies, ahhhh…they have the best fit ever! I swear guys. Sainted! You just have to size up if you don’t want to die of butt asphyxiation…

Hey guys, I though it was just me who had a hard time to find the perfect ballet flats but it seems to be a risky business for everyone. These kind of shoes might be the easiest way for everyday comfort but after a little usage they tend to look like boats. Tory Burch’s flats hug beautifully your feet and they even keep their form after playing a football match. So my little Beckhams stack them up in both colours, yes you can they’re on budget, and they’re the ideal transitional footwear for the upcoming fall. What more could you ask for? You can find them here.

Wearing Maison Martin Margiela Flame-print cotton-jersey T-shirt, Isabel Marant Ulyse parka and mesh dress, Jerome Dreyfuss Bobi bag, Alexander Wang sandals.

 Margiela brought the magic back and I’m a happy burning bush, girl. I have been eyeing this  bold, adrenaline filled t-shirt( meant to be dress) for a while, but only the last week I’ve found a decent size that shows more flames and less flesh. ..Got it? Like it? Do tell…

Hi Evangelie,

Thanks.. I just got caught up in work for a while and  – poof – the Ulyse was sold :-(.. Well, maybe I didn’t need it anyway, at least I know next time I may see one.. You sure have to move fast, when it comes to Isabel Marant 😉 – no time to stop and think for a while..

Maybe I should just focus on the new AW collections instead; so much I’m dying to get my hands on and they will hit the stores soon. I’m going to Paris in a few weeks, so I should probably give my credit card a rest until then :-)..

Take care and thanks for always replying so promptly :-)..

Berit

Hi,
Which size is your Ulyse jacket..? Thinking of getting it, but unsure whether it will be very oversize, if I get a size FR38 (which is the only one available); I’m usually a size FR36/EU34/36..
Would appreciate your help 🙂
xx
Berit

Hi Berit.
It’s a 38 size. I’ve tried 36 and was shorter so I didn’t like it. We’re the same size btw…

Φοβερό το φλογερό μπλουζάκι!

Chloe knit(and in black)/Stella McCartney boots/Gucci bag/Ray-Ban sunglasses

Outfit ph Timur Emek

In collaboration with Luisa World

 If comfort comes when you flip the sides of your blouse then….just do it! For me there should be not any kind of manuals or rules when dressing. All of us should feel comfortable and confident in our own clothes. And if our back wants to be free instead of our nipples then so be it. The depicted knit’s cleavage was way too deep to be worn over naked chest(and you know how much I dislike layering). On the contrary its structural V was perfect to point out my complete spinal anatomy, no?

You must be kinda willing to get comfortable with the discomfort…

So he were again, back to the future, on that rainy Monday morning at Stella McCartney show. The show was at 10am and I had a super early wake up call just to wash my hair with Paris’ nasty water and then take forever to blow-dry them. The result…the depicted bird’s nest. On Mondays the hairdressers in the city d’amour go on vacation and the clumsy us have to fight with our own Medusa-heads and be on time. And thank God, I was on-time to watch Stella’s ethereal creations, gracefully floating around the Opera Garnier, my second favorite place to see the PFW collections. McCartney did present maybe the most comfortable pieces of the season with personal favorites, of course, the silk parachute flight suits. A dream. And I still imagine myself living in this dream for the whole next season. I really don’t know how she does it…

Well Medusa kicked ass, so you are in good company. The sweater is a dream, and yes layering can be a…well, anyway, great photos of the show!

Wearing Etoile Isabel Marant top, Les Chiffoniers leather pants, Isabel Marant boots, Jerome Dreyfuss bag.

For the recipe you’ll need:

A brand new frivolous top. Or else your instant mood fixer.

Leather pants. They will give so much love and warmth to your precious legs that you’ll forget you’re wearing a spring blouse.

Knee boots. For the same reasons.

A fur coat. Who needs a knit when has an animal all over the body?

ps. I’m Greek, you know a hot temperamented mediterranean, living in a country with mild winters, who could wear a simple tank inside of a coat and not be considered as completely crazy (except from this damn freezing week).




great mix and match 🙂

 Jacket/Zara   pants/Zara  heels/Celine(similar here) clutch/Jil Sander fur/Isabel Marant
Photos by Charlie Makkos.

Happy February intergalactic pals. Here’s to a month that according to Susan Miller, my favorite witchy(in good way) astrologer, every single fishie(aka Pisces) gonna shine like a diamond. Bam. We’re gonna have a  light bulb hanging over our heads people! Can I have a fluorescent mysterious one over me please?
Anyways, back to the original blogging purposes, the last few months I’ve been leaning towards jackets. As blouses. From blazers, to tuxedos, to hybrid pajamas, all(and there goes my insanity) being in complete denial to cooperate with a decent top. I’m not going to pretend and say that the lack of ta-tas’ support becomes unimportant but the deep razor-sharp Vs of the jackets definitely ban any kind of such garments. On the other hand, have you ever thought that it’s this kind of intimate relationship what makes the aforementioned dressing so damn irresistible? It’s only me I guess…or not?



Perfect outfit!
You look gorgeous!

http://www.stylelove.gr

cool outfit. love the fur and celine heels. =)

the clutch is amazing!

Pisces got scales. Them shine anyway. WORD. (your pj’s-whatchamacallit) ensemble is dreamy. (sleep induced word intended) 🙂

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Bonjour!!!!! Just before heading to the beach.

I love your flats…you’re so wright, i though they were Lanvin

Second and third Acielle/Style Du Monde

So here I am just after the Acne show, surprisingly in good condition since, as I have already mentioned, Palais de Tokyo is not the best place to watch a show if it’s hot outside. I had melted, literally and not. Literally because that unavoidably happens when you are in a sauna and metaphorically because I so fell in love with the whole show. It’s a collection that I could live in for the whole next summer. If you don’t believe me check for yourselves. Does it remind you someone?

I am seriously obsessed with those cargo pants! So perfect in every way!! LOVE! Perfection!! Exquisite! Ok, I’ll stop 🙂

Love this look!! The trousers, the jumperrr!! SOSOOO amaazing!!

Hey style heroines. Did you miss me? Uhhh, stop whining, it was only two days. On the other hand when it comes to love, two days seem like eternity..Do you like my newest fur? Don’t rush to judge me. My goat was an aged, old mountain one who’s days were little. Yeah it has a special note on the tag about this, like a forgiveness paper..So point at other goats, mine is innocent.

Wearing DVF fur, Chaser t-shirt, Superfine denim, Jerome Dreyfuss handbag, Ash ankle boots.

PS. Thanks Greg for the awesome pics!

YUM! I love the tee.. and your goat is gorgeous. 😉

Two days do seem like a long time, but I knew you would have something wonderful up your sleeve when you returned 😉 This was well worth the wait, love the outfit!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I can hardly blog guys. I’m completely sleepless. A damn horny cat was shouting from the road all night long. She still is. And I’m asking a simple question to the universe: is there a new species of hybrid cats with loudspeakers in their throats? If so I’d like to order a new pair of ears with embedded ear plugs please…Pffffffff…

PERFECT!!

You look great, actually beter than great.

Beautiful Ev with the beautiful alaias<3

Bag Valentino(via Luisa World, similar here)/Sweater Valentino/Sunglasses Ray-Ban

Ph George Angelis

*Color-surprise.

No, no, no…It’s not a transitional step to the rainbow life, neither an act just to please my mom, who’s constantly complaining about my monochromatic, dark choices. I’ll be what I am. However in rare occasions there might be something out-of-the ordinary that will make my heart pounding in ears. A slice of orange in our case….

-GET IT…GET IT

And you know me…I am a getter…But who could actually resist to Valentino’s color-block supremacy, Marni’s deepest green or Mark Cross’ sleekest red? When it comes to bags we are all too weak ….

[show_lookbook_widget id=”167090″]

Wow, that bag is the cutest ! Love its color (and red suits you so well !) 

The Valentino sweater also looks incredible !

http://www.pardonmyobsession.com/

Valentino just keeps coming out with total candies. I love that top, too (I’m currently on the lookout for a perfect grey jumper-despite having about 10 in my closet already).

Wearing Karl terry and PVC sweater, Givenchy pants,  Gianvito Rossi pumps, rings from Cambodia.

Couldn’t it be a super name for a rock band? And with Lagerfeld and Tisci as its founding members, we would definitely be their groupies, wouldn’t we?

Aside from the aforementioned banana talking, I want to declare my endless love for the above outfit. Yes, I have this sporty dark side which went crazy when saw the contrast sleeve sweater from Karl Lagerfeld’s newest line, Karl. It’s probably the powerful mix of PVC with French terry which makes it so unique and a great evening top. And now the pants, ahhh the pants with the fangs.  I’ve been eyeing for these stunners for such a long time but the pricing only recently became as alluring as their looks. Falling in a body-con manner Riccardo Tisci‘s most amazing pants from his winter collection apart from making my legs lean and mean is my newest, hottest crush. Fangtastic!

ps: I would like to apologize for bad blogging the last few days but the weekend found me helpless in the country side with no internet connection. Some ideas really suck!

 

 

 

I just discovered your blog and I fell in love with your style. …FLAWLESS!

Thank you Anna…welcome girl<3

Wearing H&M men shirt, Isabel Marant shorts, bracelet and belt, Jimmy Choo fringed bag and Soixante Neuf necklaces.

I’ve always had a soft spot for the tropics and when Paola, fellow blogger and amazing illustrator, announced that she was a lucky chica moving to Mexico, I’ve made  heroic efforts to remain indifferent.

So here I am, completely uncool, in a super hot Monday noon, standing leggy by my house’s tufted fence, saluting tropics with a total vacation ready outfit. Because you know miracles happen…Yes, yes and shit too!

 

Those shorts!! They are so perfect and of course look fantastic on you 🙂

Enjoy your nice weather it’s been pretty crap here 🙁

Hey everyone! The picture is taken this morning at work, from Aspa. She’s a trainee photographer, just joking, she’s my friend who tries to handle my super f***** complicated lenses and for the first time she’s done pretty well, don’t you think? So I’m going through a phase in which I’m very fond of knits that look like modern armors..Cozy but fancy, simple but unique, warm but stylish..Sounds like an all in-one-shampoo adv? Don’t rush, miracles happen guys, and they won’t break your bank account, like this ultra sky-ish coloured sweater from Nowhere. Don’t judge me, I’ve told you I have the full collection….I’m leaving you for now, I have an appointment with my worst nightmare…my dentist! Wish me luck!

Wearing Nowhere knit, H&M pants,shirt and necklace, Alexander Wang bag.

 

 

Har du läst om läkaren som blivit anmäld för ofredande, ev våldtäkt, läs mitt inlägg om du är nyfiken. Kan man känna sig säker när man går till läkaren efter man läst något sådant?

This knit looks so cozy and wonderful! I wish the Nowhere collection was available stateside because it is soo amazing! 🙂

Miranda

My latest blinding colour obsession is nothing more than a desperate attempt to imitate the effects of an early summer’s coming. My typhoon striken head and my returning  pale complexion don’t care though…

Thank you Karina. No it’s not a large cut. It’s true to size.  I’m a size 4 btw;-)

Shirt and skirt Saint Laurent/Boots Celine/Sunglasses Ray-Ban.

Ph Timur Emek.

In collaboration with Luisa World.

None of the designers stirs our nostalgia for the past like Hedi. Into the seventies glam mood, his girls marched though a genius holographic rotating installation (which created myriad spots of rainbow light spinning around the black curtained walls) under  Aleide’s 1,2,3 uplifting beats. This was a show, drug for the tired souls. A show that left us with a cheeky smile and an unfulfilled wish: We wanted more! Yes, even first row’s stiffest legs were synchronically  moving with the rhythm. We all had a good time.The collection itself has been, per me, the sexiest ever the Historic house has presented. Breathtaking don’t-you-even-try-to-tie-alone-your-laces minis, cropped jackets, barely there shorts all modeled on his feminine army’s lean long stocking legs and their XL glittering seventies heeled sandals. A collection that left me wondering:

Will the scientists notice the sudden increase in the female population’s height? Because his sky-high heels will definitely sell out.

But where was Hedi ?

You can see photos and videos from the Saint Laurent SS15 collection on my instagram account.



Really strong look, love the boots! I have an obsession with Celine, hope you can checkout my blog! x

 Wedges/Stella McCartney(and here)
Photo by me
What you’re seeing here is the end of the madness. I was born and raised in the age of panic during which “matching” was the bible and “don’ts” the commandments. Don’t wear leather in the summer, you’re not allowed to sport chessboards for shirts(see Vuitton), the horizontal stripes make you fat, don’t mix patterns, green doesn’t ever match with blue, leopard is slutty and please don’t DON’T wear your fluffy slippers in public(see Celine). But a dish best served cold and somehow the aforementioned visual nonsense has been broken down permitting the leopards(among others) to have the sweetest revenge of all….Fasion domination! Long live the queen!

1. Charlotte Olympia 2. Christian Louboutin 3.Nicholas Kirkwood 4. Giavito Rossi 5. Mulberry 6. Kenzo 7. Manolo Blahnik  8. Jimmy Choo 9. Christian Louboutin (also with spikes) 10. Celine

Stella’s leopard print definitely does stand out to me and I’m totally into all the pieces she has out right now using it. Those wedges are incredible! 

xxTheresa

totally agree about breaking those boring rules but you are so right!!!! love your new Stella babies!

Nice selection ! Love all of them !!

MCQ oversized coat/MCQ skinny denim pants
Ph Haris Farsarakis

Back to almost winter clothing (and I say almost because this stealthy greyness belongs to the McQ Alexander McQueen Pre-Fall collection) with one coat so-chic and classy that could be seen on my all-time heroines, Lauren Hutton and Francoise Hardy. Thank GAWD, we have finally reached the turning point in fashion that trends are no more worshiping the unflattering bulkiness (or as I name it HULK-Y-NESS),  but on the contrary, they currently adore the more feminine shapes. The woman’s body is put on the map again guys and for the upcoming season the outerwear are SO buttery soft that can actually be worn as a dress, a very sexy one if you leave then unbuttoned. Do you feel it? I did and still do, demanding an invitation to cooler climates just because I need to RE-wear this stunner SOON. Yeah, winter is not coming, pffff give me a break!

Isabel Marant blouse(Grey and Blue)/ Celine pants via LuisaWorld/ Bottega Veneta bag/ Louis Vuitton earring.

Ph Timur Emek

In collaboration with Luisa World

Rumors of nasty winters have been greatly exaggerated. Winter is a wonderful thing. It’s the only season that I can dramatically layer piles of wools without complaining much. Don’t get me wrong, I adore wools, I just don’t get along well with layered cakes.  Winter came rather late to Paris this year. So the only time we could throw on us some lovin wool without getting unwanted rashes was when the sun was going to sleep. At the Parisian twilight, I wore one of my favorite outfits for this fashion week. From the stealthy grey pants to the understated brownish grey (that perfectly matched my skin’s pale colour) blouse, this shade symphony was like a multi-vitamin to my soul.   No, I am not trying to impress you by amplifying words, these are definitely not my intentions. For me feeling great in an outfit nurtures my soul, balances my aura, boosts my energy. You see it’s deeper than you think….

 

so perfect!

Your shirt is insanely cool. So envious of your Marant pieces- in a good way 🙂

I love those pants

I am dying for your track-inspired trousers! Also, where is that lovely leather and metal cuff from!? I noticed it in one of your other blog posts, and had to ask 😉

Three Thai Dresses

Hey vacationers! I am still in town and I’m envy you. But I’m doing my best to change this stinky situation..programming, programming, programming.

Remember the post, once shared about mood fixers? If yes, I love you my loyal readers….If not, WELCOME!!! So today, giving an exotic note to my stroll seemed a good anti-boredom pill and what more could i ask from a folklore Thai outfit. All the above dresses(skirts originally) were brough in January from a local market in Krabi and were the most inexpensive purchase I’ve ever done in my entire life! They really glamoured me with their vibrant patterns and their lightweight texture. Aren’t they a little Isabel-Marantish?

This evening i’ve decited to put on the first one, and actually there were many girls who stopped me while walking to ask about it’s origin. And…somehow a blogging idea was born….  Take a look of how simply i’ve combined it.



Wearing unknown designer Thai dress-skirt, Gucci handbag, Christiane Louboutin sandals, sunglasses Mykita. Geia!

 

 

you look chic exotic…:-)

i have the same one in black!!!!a perfect gift from my best frend !!!!!LOVE THAILAND!!!!!!!!!;-)

:-p

All the dresses are absolutely fabulous!!!  I really loved the first one. If i ever go to Krabi i will definitely visit the local market.I hope soon…..

i wish you’ll go soon…;-)

Gorgeous dress!

Honestly, although I am not a person that easily compliments others, these dresses look really nice and cute…I just love them on you…

thank you……big hit hahhhh

i appreciate it…….

Hey fashion lovers . What a psychedelic weather. Three days prior was winter and today… early June! A complete brain damage. But on the other hand it’s a great opportunity for some rocking autumn wear, a phrase completely strange to the greek dictionary, as there were always only two seasons for us. Summer-winter. Hot-cold. So in such a rare occasion how about sporting a jumpsuit? Yeah, a long sleeved cottoned one would be perfect. Excited? Wear it alone, or even with a tee from inside. I won’t stop you, as long as you’re happy. Just do it!

Wearing Zadig & Voltaire jumpsuit, Isabel Marant jacket, Alexander Wang booties, Kooba handbag, Matthew Williamson sunnies.

AMAZING!!!!!!!!

Ps- Missed you too 🙂

This is simply divine! And the sunnies are the perfect touch 😉

Did you know that snakes are worn traditionally in Greece for protection from evil? Imagine something like the “evil eyes” you all must acknowledge by now, but with a tail.

My own virtual 10 meter fence against viciousness are these two beloved pieces from Ileana Makri. Makri is a Greek born jewellery designer inspired by our own country’s heritage, without being folklore. Her creations are fresh and stylish, and if you believe their symbolic meaning like me,  can be proven really useful. Geia!

SNAKE JEWELRY …. NEW TREND… IN NEW YORK!!!!  U  DID KNOW  ALSO THAT MY EVANGELIE???? I DONT BELIEVE UUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I always been scare of snake ever since I was a little girl but I like to wear them as jewelry because my grandmother always did.  She always loved them and I always wonder why.  Reading this post I think I just found out why she did like to wear them and even decorate her house with some snakes pieces.  I bet she knew about this but of course never shared it, but then again I never asked her.  Always admired her taste and wanted to be like her.  Now more than ever I will wear them specially this particular ring that was hers.  It will be my protection.  Thanks for sharing this article.

Bertie. Apparently your good taste is inherent. You should try the snake thing…I swear it works!

Well cauliflower stinks like hell, there’s no need for more explanation but bell bottoms…Seriously ladies… Am I the only woman who still believes in the ultimate conspiracy theory/ flare pants as the lethal  mass destruction weapons? I mean haven’t you ever noticed that flared figures, no matter how tall or skinny you are, show off your butt with Australia’s perimeter? Hmmmmmm? If you’re anything like me, raise your hands.

However, while I ponder this dilemma, I won’t deny that there are always these crazily awesome little shits that remind us that there should be no space for the round red “stop” signs in our precious brains(the annoying creatures area is excluded). I’m referring to these Stella McCartney overalls. They’re the living proof that as long as the waste sits high enough to squeeze your ta-tas the flare style works. And flatters already.

Moral of the story: Don’t believe in rumors.

Isabel Marant pants via LuisaWorld(in size 38 to succeed the loose fit, also in black)/ Anine Bing shirt/ Balenciaga booties(in suede and wedge)/Bottega Veneta bag/ Louis Vuitton belt.

Ph Timur Emek

 

Isabel continues to be Isabel. Slouchy pants, toned shoulders and a super hot leggy army, in the sexiest ever flared minis. The coolest Marant girl was all over her latest collection. Not that I’m complaining, I am a big fan of everything she represents and I’m delighted to see her gracefully evolving. And by gracefully I mean that yes, she developes slowly her journey through fashion but one thing’s for sure, she is swimming upstream. This season the evolution came in the form of pleats. The flagship…that accordion skirt, that, I already know, will forever hunt my wish list.

The day of the show was freakin hot in Paris. I had originally planned, yes I plan my outfits during the fashion weeks, to wear my grey wool Celine pants that you will be able to witness on the next post but I have swapped them for these kinda airy cotton ones and guess what…they saved my day. Palais de Tokyo, the place of the show, is a beautiful space, has a unique façade but if you ask me, honestly is kinda unfit to demonstrate a collection during warm days. It’s a relatively small chamber, usually packed, inevitably turning into a sauna crisis when the catwalk’s lights turn on. Of course you can carry one of these portable hand-held fans but then again the question arises…Would it be chic?

 

 

fascinating trousers!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Wearing Isabel Marant Itzel pants (similar here), top and earings, Celine shoes, Jerome Dreyfuss bag.

 

And while all the previous days I’ve wished to show you how beautifully these tie dye fancies match with a plain boxy short-sleeved black sweatshirt, much to my surprise when today I laid them side by side with the above massively patterned top, the attraction between them was instant and fatal. Like the usual the good girl/ bad guy relationship. Haters until you close them in a room together. Fireworks*****

Ps. In case you’re wondering where’s my stereotypical simple aesthetic cruising right now, I shall inform you that It’s expected to arrive tomorrow…Morning! Early morning!

unexpectedly beautiful combination!

I love thoes jeans!

Both the top and pants are so pretty and special  !

 Heels/Gianvito Rossi (and the full hologram version here)   denim/Current Elliott    skull bracelet/Ileana Makri   top/Chloe(same in dress and jumpsuit)  bag/Chloe(via LuisaWorld)

And so it seems that the upcoming summer will get ruffled to death.

But have you ever wondered how in the world did we end up with this style evolution? Hear me out people: Last year’s naughty peplum got exiled(punished for misbehaviour) by the fashion mafia to the more distant sites of our bodies, arms, limbs (see Balenciaga)etc. The peplum got furious and unleashed a poisonous gas to the humanity that transformed every single fashionista to flamenco dancer to rescue. No effective antidote has as yet been discovered.

And so in the name of the “ole” madness, cheers to the insanely amazing Chloe raffled blouse which gave my shoulders the reason to shout already: Asi se baila! Hehehe…

This top is seriously amazeballs.  One of the best pieces I’ve seen thus far for spring 2013.

ALWAYSJUDGING.COM

My gosh, those heels!! Totally obsessed with hologram right now <3

WITH LOVE,
LINSEY / POSE-BLOG.COM

ahhh those shoes!! a dream <3

I love it and your writing makes me smile too

♥ Thankfifi

Amazeballs!
You look great as always!

You give FAB a whole other meaning! 

post of the day, babe!! you made me laugh out loud!

Love //VIENNA WEDEKIND//

Oh how I loved the quirky peplum story.. Could I also add that the ruffled sleeves found the perfect gal to lay their weary wings on her shoulders? and you both lived happily ever after. 

ps Greek pride hallelujah!

 Lanvin jacket/Lanvin skirt/Celine booties/Bottega Veneta bag(and in the deepest blue)
Ph Timur Emek

Well-rested, your freshly returned sofa-champion gets finally chatty. Silence was not gold in our case and even though I love styling more than writing, the second one is the only way to communicate my Parisian this time not-so adventurous adventures. Not-so because during this fashion week I was a good girl…no parties, no drinks, not staying late at night. Almost a health junkie, after a quite nasty food poisoning just a day before I touched-down Paris . Those seven days were all about the shows and enjoying the designing houses’ creative grandeur.

For this season’s fashion marathon I’ve collaborated with Luisa World, the beloved department store that carries the majority of my sartorial wishes, in order to celebrate their brand new(and super cool if I may) blog. I’d taken over their instagram for the whole six days and nights. No, no, I’ve been honest with you, my night life was quiet yet some of the shows, like Lanvin for example did start after the last rays of the sun had set.

On the 25th of September, astrologically the best day of the year according to my friend Billy,  Alber Elbaz popped up the Champaign for the historic House’s 125 years anniversary by celebrating individuality. Yes, Elbaz’s simple lines of jersey, brocade shift and rose silk dresses or the minimal shapes of the shouldered jackets over pencil skirts and wide-leg pants had nothing to do with creating an impressive, out-of-the-ordinary collection. The epicenter of the show was the face. In particular the familiar faces of Amber Valletta, Kirsten Owen, Violetta Sanchez, Natasa Vojnovic , who were wisely chosen by the designer to prove that there’s nothing more beautiful than a woman who feels confident in simple, minimal lines. Simplicity is the greatest ability, Elbaz knows….we know.

 

 

 

125 is a long time! Lanvin has such an amazing history & Alber Elbaz is such a talented designer.

If you are going to do the harem thing, do it all way. Add a knoted shirt, which i predict will be a major trend in the near future and a sassy belt worn low down on your hips. Et voila an urbanish harem princess ready to socialize across the globe.

What a fabulous look and the jacket is beautiful!

Hey my loves. Tough times? I know…But even in our darkest hours there’s always a light, somewhere. Have faith.

So, I’ve just received the first pieces from Nowhere, the collaboration between Elin Kling and  Nhu Dhuong, and I have to admit that they’re awesome! Super soft fabrics, flattering shapes, glorious easiness and the most important nowadays, affordable prices. Elin is our genie in the bottle.. What more could we ask?

You can find them here.

Jumpsuit from my capsule collection with Tom Wood, Heroine by Tom Wood/boots Stella McCartney via Luisa World(also in flat)/bag Bottega Veneta /sunglasses Ray-Ban

Ph Timur Emek

On the pic, chit chattin with Irina.

Je suis très fatigué, I am very tired, French, English, whatever, the first thing being said though to every single taxi driver when in Paris. Not due to the fact that I was (literally) running late to most of the fashion week’s shows (the traffic was insane) but also because I wore heels! Heels are killers, in the very bad way.

This time, not wisely, I’ve convinced myself to follow my bestie’s advice and turn my back on flats.

-Darling flats are so last year…people will hate seeing you every single season in trainers and combat boots. Wear some heels please, be a woman for God’s sake!

And the result…..Bare foot on the Parisian streets. Yes I’ve done that. Not one of the ten things though I would suggest someone to do in life. You know… French smoke a lot…so you might step in some (unwanted) hotness. Let me rest for a bit guys…I’ve just returned from Paris and I will be back and hopefully very chatty…Meanwhile…I can hear you…ask…ask…what would you like to know?

Those boots

Wearing Carven tribal bag, Zara fringed top and mesh t-shirt, H&M denim and Dolce & Gabbana sandals.

In between roasted lambs and red fighting eggs (the big fat Greek Easter holidays are officially ending today), I’ve found some tiny space of time to post my entire previous outfit. The  Carven bag, although is the most frivolous thing I’ve ever held, I’ve surprisingly and unconditionally loved it. Isn’t it fantastic?

totally in love with this looks sis!! all for all white at the mo with a black shoe – so very french. xxx

looking gorgeous as always, white suits you to perfection and screams ALMOST SUMMER! CAn’t wait for spring to be back here, at the moment it is freezing! Oh and your new Celine sandals from your previous posts are the loveliest sandals ever, wish I could afford them! I’m anxious to see how you’ll style them 😉

Stunning as ever, so perfect that you ‘wore’ this bag with an all white outfit. If I could pull white off like you do I would wear it more often, but I would probably end up looking like Casper the friendly ghost 🙂

This clutch is honestly to die for, the pattern & colors are really harmonious! Love how you matched it,

These boots are made for walking…I’m not singing guys, this is for real. Except from the fact that i’m totally in love with their aggressive style, they’re so comfortable that they could easily be a candidate for the heel-a-thon(aka marathon in heels).

One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you..lalala..Oops!

Wearing Ash booties, J.Crew skirt, Etoile Isabel Marant top (there’s the same at Zara), Isabel marant leather jacket.

I am sure you are walking all over many in these lovely  booties 😉 I also adore the touch of sparkle!

There is only one thing in life that’s priceless. Memories.

Yesterday my dear mother gave me the ultimate present. My grandfathers beautiful ruby ring. The  ring has a huge presence in our family history. It’s like our symbol of luck. Inherited from the males, was lost in the fields by my grandfather in the distant past. After many years, like a miracle, was rediscovered in a hole in the ground, when digging to plant melons. The ruby  from the hit has a small crack but my family never replaced it, as it is considered an extremely lucky rock.

So it was time, according to my mother,  as the only child, to receive it. It was an emotional moment. I remembered my granddad. His sparkling eyes, his long stories, the times we were playing, the love he had for me. Everything. Memories that I had buried when we lost him and the ring unleashed.

I love you my ” Mits” and missed you.

Wearing Diane von Furstenberg dress, HTC booties.

This is a beautiful post and thank you so much for sharing it with us.

 Sweatshirt/T by Alexander Wang (and here)   sunglasses/Celine   skirt/Roberto Cavalli   bag/Chloe(via LuisaWorld)
Happy Monday lil fellas.

Whoa, there’s a sudden burst of frivolousness in the air, even my sunnies are  harassing my ass, don’t you see that? Ping..ping…ping. So Athens is living the dream of “Alkionides”( the warm sunny days which according to mythology were given by the Gods to the kingfisher during January in order to lay its eggs on the rocks)-bad teacher-and somewhere in between here I am with an unexpected, shameless, desire of girliness(as it happens every single time a couple of sunrays heat my brain). Limited though, because the leopard can’t change its stripes spots, nope, so when Alex left home, I secretly invaded in his closet, stoooooole the depicted sweater…for real (I swear) and disciplined that nasty cuteness of the stripped tutu. Sorry babe, I know you’re still pissed off but hun do you actually know how impossibly difficult it is to find a descent boxy sweater? You don’t care…pfff..


 

Love the Chloe Marcie…Just convinced me to get it! I was between this and a Moschino one.

Equipment knit/Belanciaga pants(Freeshop)/Saint Laurent boots (here and here)/Rayban sunglasses

Ph Jordan Makarof

Forget about camouflage. Patterns are a past issue. All the young women soldiers who want to look cool have decided on upgrading themselves to the Special Forces Elite. That means no patterns should be used to survive the style-defence game. Special Forces’ uniforms are discrete, monochromatic and fierce. Because to be a real heroine you just have to be and feel strong and confident, not loud. Got it? If not, drop and gimme 50 push-ups. Let’s go!

You can never go wrong with an all black look.

Hey loves. I’m displaying a couple of shots before heading to the brrrrrs(bars) with my man. Thus my camera is going for a little nap, my hands will be extra busy holding Daquiries. .. Do yo like my dress? Is the last thing left to remember Carrie, Bradshaw. Just kidding, i can’t stand the idea of another SATC, with the same old team, but this outfit is one of the most beautiful pieces from Halston Heritage.  I love its understated luxury that  I can easily style with so many different ways. Today I dared to put it with my Ash booties and thank God the breezy July air was totally by my side . My black studded shoulder bag is from Marc Jacobs.  Ah, let me share a story about it. I was in Dubai and taking the elevator to leave my floor, I’ve met a middle-aged local woman dressed in gold from head to toe. When she saw my bag, her eyes popped out and with her heavy accent she asked me:” Chanel(chhhhhanel)?” Happy me, I’ve started to explain who the designer was, but the moment the doors opened she turned to me with a derogatory tone :”No Chanel(chhhhhanel)???? Hmmmmmmmmm” and left.

So my No Chanel bag is simply wonderful, for me…..Geia!

This dress is gorgeous!!!

Acne bermudas(same in leather)/Acne knit(both via Freeshop)/Louis Vuitton belt/Alexander Wang boots(similar here).

Ph Jordan Makarof

 

I know, It’s hard to reminisce about the old days without iPhone yet weren’t they much easier? I’m experiencing an i-phone crisis people. A major one! The previous one had been stolen when in Paris, replaced by a brand-new one and now my shiny-precious-I-cannot-live without mobile doesn’t work. Kaput. I’ve tried to snap a juicy Pavlova and the screen got stuck on black.

-It might got choked by the calories. I phones are too chic for sloppy desserts…

Pfffff…. Dunno. I’ve just bravely saluted it and prayed for the quickest replacement. The positive thing, you see there is always a bright side, now that I don’t have the devil on hand to interrupt my focus, I can blog more. So  voila, the outfit that will probably be my winter armor. Mid lengths and high boots. But first, let me tell you a secret. If you are all into covering your legs while wearing long skirts or bermudas, you’d better start to wear heels. Because you know, sporting flat boots with mid-lengths, will inevitably tag you into the “Middle-Earth-Hobbits” category, thing that nobody wants to happen(before Christmas). Karlie Kloss is excluded. She always is :).

U manage to put all the hot new trends for this winter together (mid pants, turtle neck sweater, boots and of corse the amazing belt bag) and u look gorgeous bravo!!

You look stunning….like a model!!

This is probably one of your best outfits to date ! Love this so much, your Acne knit and your boots are wonderful !

Hey little mermaids! How are you coping with all this rain? What? Mermaids are waterproof! Oh you clever girls…I can’t help notice that weather is tight ready. Yes it’s true you can finally sport the winter’s beloved polka-dot prints on your legs like I apparently did. And I have to admit this is the season’s cutest fashion trend. Perfectly coordinated with a midnight blue wool dress and low heeled ankle booties for a super comfy casual Saturday night. Cheers!

Granny or not, I love throwning heavy coats over my shoulders. I know this is awkward for some of you but think about it, when Phillip Lim, the glorious trend setter, attached straps inside his cover-ups in order to preserve their position over your shoulders while moving, I’m certainly not the one to resist.Go batgirls!

Wearing 3.1 Phillip Lim Silk satin-crepe straight-leg pants (find them here and here) and oversized clutch, Etoile Isabel Marant tank, Givenchy Obsedia cuff, A.Wang sandals.

It’s 3:58 am and I’ve just started exposing my remaining awake brain cells to the entire blogosphere. This is not good, not good at all.

It’s 4:03. Five minutes for 25 words. Wow. I’m completely crawling.

Anyway, as you’ve probably have assumed by now, I have a huge affection for the sport silhouettes. I remember when I firstly spotted the Isabel Marant Uden pants on her s/s catwalk. At that point of time, I knew that these thick liners would completely dominate my drooling syndromes. Unfortunately the aforementioned pants were a huge disappointment. Their jersey heavy fabric was completely identical with my youth’s athletic pants. And that’s not cool. That’s school.

Searching for their more refined version I stumbled upon the above Lims.That was It! The bright side of the track pants. Soft lightweight silky texture that feels like a feather’s touch. Bonus point: The thick side lines makes your legs look lean and mean. Just heaven!

 

 

 

My favourite blogger…..Really perfect.

You are such an insperation! Im soon going to work at the filmfestival in Cannes, I hope you can check in on my blog sometime 🙂

I really like this outfit! 🙂

Leather jumpsuit Heroine by Tom Wood(available in stores mid October)/Acne t-shirt/Adidas trainers, model code Samba(similar here)

Ph Jordan Makarof

Finally! From lookbook to reality. One of the best parts of creating magic. Because isn’t it magic when one of your thoughts comes alive?

So here I am dressed like a sexy mechanic ready to solve world’s style issues(well almost). The depicted jumpsuit, was actually my second design for Tom Wood (first one was my father’s shirt). I needed in my life a sleek all in one piece which with some styling additions could turn from sporty to a hell of a night-wear. A piece that actually brought me back to the days that all-in-one(s) were the biggest part of my mom’s wardrobe.

When I was a child, I was sitting for hours on the floor watching her getting ready. And mom was always super late, with my dad in the car furiously blasting the horn. His own way to speed her up yet a woman Aries easily adapts to ignore… Our weekends’ reality.

So Mrs Smyrniotaki had a massive collection of jumpsuits, all with huge golden buttons thought..It was late 80’s you see. Fashion was totally injected with blings and golden buttons were likely to be considered as a turn to minimalism.

As a consequence to the aforementioned history lesson I’ve been brainwashed. The jumpsuits became my lifetime obsession. No wonder why they were among the first clothes I’ve designed.

And now it’s live, I’m all ears…like?

I love your clothes for tomwood, I live in greece, where can I buy them?

Hi my dear. Thank you.
Please contact Tom Wood for all the points of sale.

You are really talented as designer as well as a fashion blogger I really like ur blog and this post particularly! Keep on rocking! Xx

And I wonder…Has fashion been (accidentally) channeling the typical Charlie Chaplin uniform or  it’s just that THE high-waist pants to fit on every single body have been miraculously discovered ? Who’s gonna answer? I….I will! I have mentioned too many times on my posts about the most-wanted leg elongators but never before there was the one to match with every single figure. The fan part is that until now, I’ve considered Marant to be the ultimate babe-maker designer but never a master of the looser shapes. Well I was wrong. Slouchiness in the most flattering way, was her evolution. And I love, love people who are discreetly evolving themselves. So here we go girls, put your winter net on, tie the highest you can your softest wool pants and you are ready almost for anything.

 

 

 

You look great in all black.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

Brrrr…It’s snowing baby…and I really should be outside with the rest of the gang maniacally building snow castles and big fat snowmen but my all-time cold, embarrassingly freezing nose and hands, have permanently banned me from such risqué activities. So here it goes live from the depths of my sofa, breaking the ice, literally, with a couple of espresso shots and in full sweats.

The fact is that snow is not granted for Athens so every time it happens it’s a huge fiesta for every single kid or kid-at-heart. I can remember myself at kindergarten, yes I still can, wondering what magic was behind the mechanism that turned the green fences into whites. Then I knew…it was snow-white!

Anyways, there I am a whole 1.72 meters full in conflicts locked up in the house. Innocent preppy-ish upside, fetish downside. Good girl gone bad in the blink of an eye. The YSL red riding hood’s dream, was bought in an unexpected twist of sales and it’s so lightweight yet warm which makes it the perfect layering piece(even over a leather jacket) for the winter. For the Sofia‘s I don’t have to say that much..Still haunting every staughtish* girl’s dreams. Am I right?;)

Ph Jordan Makarof

But seriously, did you ever think that I would welcome back Autumn? Yes it’s still hot in here but we, the Greeks, are the children of summer and we actually still enjoy some spare sun-rays. You guys…I’m saluting my inspiration. Despite the temperatures, August was rather a frozen moth for me. It practically felt impossible to brainstorm anything. Maybe some evil planets had been squaring over my head for the whole moth, blocking thus my cosmic vibes…who knows. But I’ll be back, like another Arni (Schwarzenegger) ready to make some serious noise. However I can’t really sing say that I’m back to black. Because as you already might know I’m forever coupled with the darkest shade of all. A Morticia in rise. So welcome me back family, with my all-time favorite outfit. Le Smoking tuxedo .

What in the world? Why my hat does look like the dust magnet from hell? R: just because it is!

 

Love the jacket, I tend to find that at times, Balmain runs big on coats/jackets– what size are you wearing?

Peek a boo! Don’t you love this embellished collar?  I had a Dolce & Gabbana moment when I dug up this old shirt from my closet and boy it surely gave a lot of spice to this cow-ish yet warm knit dress. Like a hidden treasure…

I love your collar…I am into precious collars too… my favorite is by Pinko… just got it today!!!

Is it possible wearing an androgynous outfit and look like a marsh mellow? Of course! Let me remind you Celine’s light pink catwalk ensemble for fall 2011. See now?  Exactly to the point.

Wearing a Junya Watanabe Comme des Garcons playsuit, Maje belt, Alexander Wang backpack and Giuseppe Zanotti sandals which I’ve just found for you here. Geia!



So simple but right on style in the light pink. These pictures are beautiful too … the Acropolis in the background and the lush greens. Am totally obsessed with your blog right now.

Hey my little centipedes! We belong to the same species you know. The happy feet coocoos . But I think I’m done with the shoes. Ok, ok, at least for now. Don’t you know that I have strong will? You’ll see. Of course any presents are welcomed!

So a good friend of mine asked me which i think are the best shoes for this season. The above image serves like my personal survivor kit winter ready yet fancy feet.  Here’s my best from right: Prada pointy toes, Ysl Tribtoo and Opyum pumps, Alexander Wang Fabiana sandals and Ashley boots, Isabel Marant Manly and Bekett boots and finally Ash Crosby booties.

I want them all but even more the white cowboy boots!!!

**D O U B L E ***** L I K E!!!!!!!!**

This selection is so impressive 🙂 Your taste is impeccable love!

Black coloured pedicure is not for the gothic people. Is for the most stylist fashionistas in the world. And to answer to my good friend Gina: Black nails just rock!

Shoes are giuseppe zanotti design.

i also have a thing with black nails 🙂

Nice pedi ! Matches perfectly with the sandals ! Go Gina !

lol! welcome Elena!

I love them! One of my favorite colors when it comes to pedicure 😉

Wearing Zayan dress(gifted from Dubai’s boutique Sauce), 3.1 Phillip Lim oversized clutch, Isabel Marant belt and sandals, Soixante Neuf bracelet.

Happy Easter everyone! In Greece we celebrate it this Sunday and I’m aleady packing for my country home, so prepare for dozens of kitchy red egg filled photos.

To  divert your attention back to the sartorial purpose of this post, let me ask you: have I ever mentioned  my favorite colour? Ahh I know it’s too obvious. The title is huge to get ignored. So let me make it harder. My favorite type of dress? Hmmmm….mini whatever is not an answer.

It’s the shirt-dress and evidently this Saturday’s frivolous outfit was like a full ” like” checker. Far more playful than the ones I usually wear, this loose yet quite luxurious midnight blue dress was one of these surprises that really steals your heart. I’ve smarten it with a metallic low-waisted belt for a more rebel chic easy look.

Thank you Laila and Zayan I’ve absolutely enjoyed it!

Vive le Dubai!

 

 

 

This is really fascinating, You’re an overly professional blogger.
I’ve joined your feed annd sit up for in the huntt for extra of you great post.

Love this colour and dress on you.  Are you able to tell where that cuff is from…Love it !!!!

Hi Rachael..I’m so sorry I’ve forgot to put a link of my cuff. Mind issues… It’s Soixante Neuf. I’ll try to find it online and update it. Thank you.

Hey easy goers! How are you doing? Hard Saturday night or it was a playground like mine?  Mara’s twins had their first birthday and i was invited in a party full of joy, colours and endless games. So what to wear in a children’s party? The big No: minis. Unless you want your panties to be a public spectacle after hours of kneeling to catch the little devils, avoid them. I’ve went the safe way by wearing a dark pair of jeans. Classic for an untrained eye but not for yours. I’m sure you can see the black rolling contrast at it’s end. So awesome. I’m crazy about little hidden details which makes you feel more daytime chic less survivor’s costume…

Wearing Etoile denim, H&M knit, Prada pointy toes, Maje belt.

 

 

What jeans size do you have? 🙂

Hey prada girl, generally I fit in 26, these particular ones got them in size one.
Hope I’ve helped!

Simplicity at it’s best!

love it

I love denim with pointy toes… So feminine!

I know you think white is a good color for us brunettes, however I am really loving this black knit on you! It is an amazing little piece.

Lovely post 🙂

XX,
Miranda

I had such a long time to see Irene. She is my sister, from another father and mother. Just kidding. She is my best best friend, a Capricorne, and for those who don’t know about horoscopes, incurable optimist and honest to a fault.  She is also a super stylish gorgeous blonde but these characteristics could only be inherited. We’ve met in a new hot spot for having a quick brunch. The place is hip but for me with a small defect. In the restaurant area  you could only see huge rectangular tables with hungry strangers seating together. This automatically transformed our original idea about a table of two, to six and later to eight. Is this overloaded intimacy a new trend? Our little secrets must be public news by now and that’s not me at all. Next time Starbucks, i believe it will be a better idea..Geia!

Wearing Isabel Marant pants which you can find here in grey colour, Acne top and shoes, Zara belt, Stella McCartney bucket bag, Marc by Marc Jacobs bracelet.



Absolutely gorgeous Darl!!<3

wow…killer pants

thanks babe!!!!!LOVE YOU!!!!!next time randevouz at starbucks ……PROMISE!!!!!

Ni hao! I have it all figured out! If I’m continuously repeating Mandarin words by the end of the day the universe’s completely shorted out system will simultaneously teleport me to the top of Jin Mao Tower so I can happily watch the new year’s fireworks burning Shanghai’s cloudy sky.  It’s simple no?

Deprivation syndrome. These are the exact words for my recently acquired insanity. Actually this year might be the first time that me and Alex are staying home since 2003 that we’re together.  It’s no secret that both of us, have a massive affection to Southeast Asia’s distance shores, all the way across from Thailand to Indonesia and then back to Malaysia(I wish I was blogger at that point of time).  However our plans for the night are pretty awesome and our company even more.

Back to blogality*, here I am, frivolous depicted(not so much), in a  ruby whirlwind, and a story that goes like this… Girl mad for Marant’s western shirts. Shirts hit the stores ridiculously overpriced. Girl mad with Marant. Marant doesn’t give a damn. Girl waits for the sales. Sales happen. Girl finds the shirt. Shirt perfectly fits. Girl salutes Marant. Gotcha!

HAPPY NEW YEAR PALS.

Hybrid:blog-reality

I love this!

Kiss,

You are so gorgeous!!!!!

Isabel Marant’s catwalk featherish accessories have started to dominate the magazine’s editorials one by one,  making them the most popular trend for this fall. But  if you are a fashionista, spending 180$ for four feathers(two per ear)  is too much. I’ve had this Anna Selezneva’s photo of my previous post stuck in my subconscious all day, hurting my deprived shopping mania and seriously I’ve needed a feather to heal me. My medicine was one stop at H&M. I passed by to shop the famous necklace for my good friend Marilie and look, I’ve  found a treasure. Aren’t they pretty? And they’ve only cost me 6$. Now tell me mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?

Hey party animals. World economy sucks which raises philosophical questions like what should I wear on Friday night denim or dress? Am I right? Come on guys, save the irony, it’s just the woman’s nature who in crisis situations can pull the plug and search for an easy antidote, a natural calmer. Back to our main purpose, if your daily routine is blue like the pile of jeans in our closet, don’t you want to get a little more dressy? I do! Isabel Marant for once again is your gal. Down to earth, comfort dresses  with a lot of guts and fun. You know it needs guts  to wear a goat’s beard between your tits. Stand out and wear it plain, nothing on your neck, a big No, because the cheerful sympathetic previous animal will transform to a nasty arabic camel, and we don’t want this girls, right?

Wearing Isabel Marant dress which you can find it here and the same designers boots which, as fas as I know, are globally sold out in this colour! Catch them in burgundy here while it lasts. Damn production!

 

Speechless!!!! You look fantastic!!!!

Agreed. Sometimes a great dress, such as this IM one is needed for a little mood booster, and I need those fringe boots in my life soon….

Miranda

Ps- You look gorgeous as always  😉

Hey golden girls. I don’t know about you, but jewelry have special significance for me. They usually serve a purpose than  just making the bling effect. Remember back in September when I was vacationing in Cambodia? This is the red rope on my left hand. I was diagnosed by a Khmer monk that I have really bad luck, but fortunately he was my mighty savior and he tied it on my wrist to castaway the evil. Whatever. The shield ring  and the snake pendant are my protectors. My bad luck juju. On the right hand is just the Arty. That was hard but every simple outfit needs a little fancy.

Wearing Ileana Makri’s serpent pendant, Ysl Arty ring.

Love your bling 😉

There are days you just want  to dress in comfort, to walk many miles, to seat on filthy benches, and eat like a pig  lying over the park’s green grass. My evening was exactly like this and I wanted to cherish those moments as much as I could. I wore my Jimmy Choo trainers , the ripped lightwashed Zara shorts and my beloved Maje silk shirt. It’s a piece that I’m extremely emotionally tied with.  It reminds me my latest trip to Paris, a fully romantic week where I enjoyed its beauties at their maximum. I got it instantly, since it was exactly what  I was looking for, a beige silk shirt with buttons starting from the bust line, something a little more feminine than the usual granny style. Maje is a french brand created from Moroccan-born designer Judith Milgrom, ideal for embracing the Pasisian chic in a more affordable way than Isabel Marant for example. Anyhow all these beautiful memories from Paris combined with our extra  free time today, brough an unexpected decision!!!I won’t reveal it yet but in a while be sure that you’ll be the first to know….

Lovely trainers!!!

You look fabulous.  Love the cut-off shorts, they are my favorites!

Well, well, well. You’ve had a long time to see my back. Right. It’s not that I’m kind of rude, you know that I love you, but what else could I do to prove to you that boxy knits don’t get you fat? Hello Myth Busters.. In fact except that they’re an awesome cover up for the upper thigh area after the summer’s misdemeanors, they’re somewhat doing the lengthen effect to the body. Really, standing tall. And with these ballet pointes hybrids as sandals, there’s something  in the air tonight girls….

Wearing Alexander Wang knit and sandals, Current Elliott leather pants.



 

 

Alexander Wang’s collection for this season is such incredible! From the shoes, knits, dresses… Ahhh!

You picked some fabulous pieces here!

So easy and cozy….and ultimate stylish!

One word…LOVE! Love the sweater, love the heels, love the leather pants. Sigh***

Good morning loves! I wish you all to have a super great week! White, white, white. How much more of it can you stand from this blog? Be patient, there is definitely more to come. So girlfriends what is our moto? Be large on awesome accessories. They truly transform the most indifferent outfit. For example these ripped off jeans were absolutely dead in my closet ( by the way did you know that white is the colour of death for the Chinese, damn cold hearted Wikipedia)  but by adding my brand new fringe boots and this boxy tuxedo vest don’t they look like the hypest acquisition in the world? You could oppose that who gives a shit about the denim when the lower part of the body is hugged by these two supreme Pocahontas, but then nobody is perfect alone, don’t you think?

It’s a red-hot tie-dye stunner and it’s gonna hug my legs in awhile.. Can you guess? hehehe

MARANT PANTS!

I would like to share this with you bec you are also as big a fan of marant as myself. My first piece was a v-neck flower summer  dress, pure silk,with fringed tiny ruffles at the ends of the neck and shoulders. I met with Marant’s designs through a very fashionable older sisterlike friend of mine and she is the birth mother of my fashion self:) So when i first started reading your blog i was amazed how your sense of fashion reminds me of her hence Isabel Marant pieces that you usually combine. Wish we could start up a Marant sisterhod;)

Ahhh..thank you love.
Oh yeah…we could start it… with pleasure…
Does this means that we could also have free goodies from IM? hehehe

Ha! Never thought of it that way:) that would be icing on the cake, and maybe seats for the shows? 😉

Everything is more than welcomed;-)

I love these jeans… I would guess Isabel Marant and it is one of my wish list items along with the Rea Sandals with ankle straps by Isabel Marant!!!

XOXO

  Just a few days before the dawn of 2012, and I’ve been honored to be asked from Harper’s Bazaar USA to share my style resolution for the upcoming year. For those who know me well, it’s pretty easy to guess(I’m bitching about it all the time) …For the rest…It’s just one click away. Click…Click.
Needless to say I’m in seventh heaven….

Thank you Kerry, thank you Harper’s Bazaar!

I have a tendency to simplicity. Clean lines, blacks, whites and denim make me feel extremely comfortable. It

 

must be something in my DNA. So when I saw this dress hanging in the store I had an instant crush. I was looking for some time for a long-sleeved  one, that could be worn throughout the day and believe me this stunner looks equally amazing with flat sandals or with high-heeled pumps. Last night just before heading to a Japanese restaurant, I though to make it a little more edgy than feminine and added this belt across my body.  Like a modern glamazon. Did you like the outcome?

By the way, yesterday we had a amazing time with the couple we’ve met at Krabi in January. We are not very fond of socializing  in our vacations but this  random meet, was totally karmic. It brought to our lifes two respectfull and integer characters,when interpersonal relationships seems to collapse. What’s happening to this world?

Wearing: the black dress is from Zara, the crossbody belt is vintage, the clutch Alexander McQueen, and the shoes are Gucci.



Great style!!! i love the golden acessories! gold and black means power and simplicity.

kisses
zoe

You could be easily a cover magazine girl! This is a imposing dress! And you paired so well with the acessories!!! 

Great sense of style, you got my heart!

Kisses,
Cis.

Well….how was it? Was the Christmas extravaganza party you’ve all hoped for or so boring that you’d prefer to stab to death yourselves with your killer(but fuckin awesome) sky-high heels. The post is all yours….I want to hear you! Hmm..metaphorically. Don’t call me!

 

You don’t look stunning; you are stunning!

Hi! Follow your blog every day, congratulations on everything!

I must ask though, is that faux or real fur? 

xx

An uber cool look, you never get it wrong.
Happy New Year and look forward to your 2013 posts.

♥ Thankfifi
p.s. I did not want to stab myself with my amazing heels – they were wedges anyway…

Wonderful. Love the outfit. The hat suits you. 

Have good day!

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

What’s your favorite pieces in your wardrobe? Mine are the shirt-dresses. They are the easiest way to have killer looks with minimal efforts. Just throw them on you, add a super sexy pump and you’ll be ready for jaw dropping entrances.

 Today I am wearing a psychedelic green checked hybrid dress, half shirt half draped from Isabel Marant. It is sold out but I believe you’ll be crazy about  this one too. My lustrous leather heels are from Dolce & Gabbana and the clutch is Phillip Lim. Geia!

You look beautiful.  I like this outfit a lot.

I like the colour of the dress, suits with everything. I love the bag

Love the Phillip Lim wristlet! And that bracelet is gorgeous!

  Yumi leather dress/Isabel Marant (still availability at LuisaWorld) white shirt/J.Crew  bag&shoes/Celine

Merry Christmas style heroines! May the eternal sunshine of the mediterranean weather live in your hearts this Christmas and throughout the years to come.

Let’s celebrate the festive season with a thematic post: how to dress when it comes to feasts. Re: natural you!

Here’s the thing: While I loved during my younger years to dress like a Christmas tree(plugged in) lately I’ve developed a strange allergic reaction to whatever shines brighter than Tour Eiffel’s flashing lights. And definitely glitters are festive but now I know I’ll never have that level of glamorousness again…

So behold how I’ve dressed yesterday: the Isabel Marant laser-cut  mini dress paired with my nasty patent leather Celine loafers. And my shocked crowd asks: Flats for Christmas Eve? Why not? I needed something to balance out the sexiness of the dress and the shirt…well the shirt wasn’t  enough. And I wasn’t invited to the Governor’s ball for god’s sake…

ps:lately I have many emails asking me for the pieces I’m wearing that are sold out, where you could find them. Well from now on, I’ll add the link from the shops I’ve bought them with the hope that helps you. xo

LOVELY dress!

X Marjolein – Never Too Polished.com

Thumbs up for staying natural during all the festivities of the season, especially when it includes flat shoes!!  Outfits stay equally polished. Thanks for stating that !:)

Electra xo

AGREED! totally feel for a “natural” way to dress up for the festivities, no excess with glitter or any sky high heels!!! You read my heart honey, and you’re like always, perfect hun!

xo Nicol

I love your style!!!^^

xoxo

It’s a cape no it’s a sweater! But I’ve seen it flying. Just joking! It’s Alexander Wang’s split knit in blush from which you could side expose your goodies…. as you wish!

You can find it here.

Bittersweet memories. I’ve had so many expectations about last night. In all my life I’ve never heard my father’s advice not even once,  to keep my feet on the ground. I’m the type of woman who lives through her imagination and you know when you dream of the ideal, the reality is always harsh. I had the best ticket, the best mood and the best company for the concert. At last I was going to see my teen love, the man I was supposed to marry( when I was 13). 

John Bon Jovi. Come on don’t laugh with me…He was beautiful…. He still is extreme good-looking for his age but also tired. And this leads to my first question.

Who the hell told them to come to Athens in July, the hottest month of the year???? The stadium was like a huge boiling cauldron and we, melting inside. The group did such excessive efforts to overcome the heat and finish as programmed that I believe for two days now they should be sitting on ice cubes.Mentioning that i also have the following query: How on earth, they are 20 years older than me, jumping all night long and I was the one who left with a killer pain on my lower back? The first pain, because the second started today on the back of my neck because I had my head lifted all the time to see them on a stage that looked like a skyscraper. Come on people. You should always have contact with the audience, they don’t bite and the middle age women can’t  jump on stage anymore. This was really ugly. All of us who were at the front we were looking at a huge gap filled with security men, if they had crocodiles they probably had thrown them in, and a big black wall.

John still has it. The voice, the package, everything. He is the living proof, of why some people stand out in life. But as aforementioned he was tired, very tired. And sometimes I think his eyes looked sad. But on the other hand, we all have our moments, or maybe the man was just trying to survive under 50 degrees with all the lights on him. Sambora was  drunk, yet dapper.

Have you ever heard about the tickets phenomenon in Greece? There are people who pay, the stupid ones like me, and people, familiar faces, who always have a way for a free, the clever ones. Yesterday in the circle, the privileged area in front of the group, they were the majority. You could distinct them by the green sponsor tags and was really ridiculous. And the bad thing in this country is that they think in this way they are better.

Anyway even when the camera brakes, you can’t breathe from the heat, and your lower back pains, when John smiles everything else disappears.

Wearing yesterday head to toes Isabel Marant. Today, my top is T by Alexander Wang, skirt and belt 3.1 Phillip Lim and shoes from Giuseppe Zanotti. Geia!

You look gorgeous.  Love the skirt and the shoes! Great outfit!

EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!

I love the shoes! Gorgeous!

Accept my apologies for the quality of the photos but my camera in the last one has broken down for good.

Just came back from a concert that I’ve waited 20 years to experience. I am going to sleep now, I am so exhausted, but  I promise tomorrow you’ll have all the spicy details…..Goodnight…

Thanks alot! I found them at Barney’s. 🙂

Love your skull bracelet…..where is it from?

It’s from Ileana Makri..let me know if you want to find for you a link…

Hey Rapunzels! After years of fighting with my super frizzy lion-like locks i’m in position to advise you that when your hair day sucks….stuck them in your turtleneck! Life has never been easier!

There are some theoretical questions that even hypothetically speaking cannot get answered. Take for example my previous post’s tittle: Where  the angels live…? Does anybody knows the answer?(in heaven doesn’t count…too easy)

However much to my own surprise, miracles do happen.

Yes the city of angels, does exists.  There they live the  most kind, well-mannered, sweet, GOOD people I’ve ever met, with first of all my hostess, Diana. Thank you sweetheart for the amazing stay. You’ve really made me feel like home and I promise you, PROMISE, this summer in Mykonos we’ll have the time of our lives.

Ps. I know that I was a really, really bad blogger lately but now that I’m awake, literally awake, I’ll blog like there’s no tomorrow.

 

 

I love your flats!

My love!
You are a great photographer! These pics are amazing!

I miss you so very much!

Yes your vision works perfectly well and there is a good reason the images are so blurred. This is my personal manifest. I want to understand what makes a fashion blog great, the quality of the pics or the blogger’s style? As the time passes by I see the constant struggle of the bloggers of accessing the ultimate shot, spending thousands on the latest DLSR cameras, forgetting something important. That at the end the only think that matters is your personal style. So take a breath relax and enjoy fashion’s amazing world.

Wearing Kain dress, Isabel Marant leather jacket, Ash booties.

I agree! Lovely post!

I agree with you a lot about this, in the end a good photograph is not important if the subject is not great. But there is still something beautiful about a good photograph 😉

I totally agree with you Paola!

Like!!!

I had been eyeing up this bracelet for a long time but on the other hand you know, the ego of a sworn enemy of anything silverish is huge. Yesterday I gave a chance to try it on and since I am really obsessed with it. Why no one ever tried to pursue me with the flattering abilities of the silver colour on tanned skin? It would have been saved many years silverless. And this bracelet… it’s so beautiful and shiny, hugs my wrist  absolutely perfectly and actually goes with everything. What more could I ask?

 Hello new silver word!

Wearing Marc by Marc Jacobs bracelet, Isabel Marant striped pants, H&M top, Ileana Makri snake ring.

Love these pants girl!!

photos by Sissi Ch.

Transmitting live from Mars Zurich( having a rare moment of enlightenment), I’ve noticed how remarkably a simple strike of green can totally draw you away from your long-lost teenage years` style heroine. Morticia Addams that is(mine at least). Are you surprised? Common..All these months, massive black…it sould ring a bell.

Well, I’m guilty as charged guys. And its the same old tale. Shitty little teen, dressed like crow, accessorized with more crosses than the Pope, pierced like an Emmental, waiting the chance to kick every single boy`s butt with her Dr. Martens. That`s quite a change, no?

However even though everyone around me were heavy metal, I always felt and was a rock ballad.;)

A major hail to the words-  waiting the chance to kick every single boy`s butt with her Dr. Martens… haha and no way, Morticia? really? I loved so much Mortizia Addams, so much!! haha Anyways, I would love to meet that freaking teen with a Mortizia look who kick boy’s butts! Love!

xo, and happy hollidays Ev!

Bling extravaganza. Hey party animals! How many times did you feel the desire to look like a human visual effect, an exploding firework that glamours the crowds? What? Everyday? Come on guys this is not Vegas! Every  Saturday is good for start and I have the absolute solution for your breakthrough appearance. These dazzlingly bright Dolce & Gabbana disco ball pants. Aren’t they something else? In reality they look less silverish than in the picture and they are super low. But remember everything around an outfit like this one must be kept plain and this is a law.  The only catch is that they sting like hell.

Wearing Dolce & Gabbana  pants, Topshop tank, Alexander Wang boots, crocodile clutch from Bangkok.

These are simply amazing! I love throwing some sparkle in my life for some instant gratification.

I’ve searched a lot. Believe me. But nothing I’ve seen could be compared to these Alexander Wang stunners. While their price is high, there is an extreme leg flattering factor on them, rarely existing in low heeled ankle boots. This worths a little sacrifice, doesn’t it? After all they’ll be worn to death!

You can find them here.

I bet you have the most amazing closet! Can’t wait to see the post of you wearing this amazing  pair of boots.

XX,
Miranda

There are some decisions that overcome the logic’s sphere. Spending around 300$ for cut-offs is definitely one of them. But from the moment I saw these Balmainish Erin Wasson shorts, I was totally hypnotised. They became my distinct line between the rational and the absurd. Of course you can see which dominated. For my excuse I call it style instinct and you do know something? It feels better like this, and it might actually save you a little from being a random tourist to be a dashing one. Geia!

Wearing last season’s Erin Wasson X RVCA cut-offs, top, Castaner wedges, Alexander Wang Walker Doodle backpack.

Photos by Charlotte

I can hardly recognize myself lately.

Since I’ve started blogging, I seriously obtained abilities that I thought I’ve never had. Case in point, my long lost self-control.

Apparently I didn’t want to expose the Company’s photo-shoot outfit, so I kept these images in the depths of my hard disk, ignoring a malefic inner voice that just wanted to ruin everything. Behave…behave …behave.

Anyways, back to that day, even thought there were piles of amazing clothes in the studio and I mean PILES, I’ve strategically chosen to dress up with pieces that I’ve had already in my wardrobe. Pieces that I was totally obsessed with and crazily in love with. So…tah-dah… a sneak peek of myself.

Like? Hmmmmmm?

Hmm it seems like your blog ate my first comment (it was extremely long) so I guess I’ll just sum it up what I wrote and say, I’m
thoroughly enjoying your blog. I too am an aspiring blog writer but
I’m still new to the whole thing. Do you have any helpful hints for newbie blog writers? I’d genuinely appreciate it.

Love the shoes!They give a nice accent to your outfit!

loooooooove everything on you,

 hair, clothes, smile,style! EVERYTHING

Good morning, I am wishing to all to have a great great week.

Yesterday I woke up with my batteries filled after the previous laziest day of the year and decided to enjoy some sightseeing around the area . But I had to protect myself from melting in a serious, Finnish sauna, weather situation. So I kept the fabrics the lightest I could and picking this saucy Etro dress seemed a godsend solution. I also endorsed , my latest trend crash, green with everything(if you read my posts you know what I mean), with the sapphire Lanvin bag and finally added the most comfortable sandals in the world, for real, my beloved Louboutins…. Ready for the heat combat don’t you think? Geia!

Wearing Etro dress, Lanvin bag, Christian Louboutin sandals, ASOS cuff.

Remember ….?

you r wearing my favourite dress!!!!!!

Cute dress! Where did you get it????

It’s previous season Etro, so i am afraid you cannot find it now…….

I am so agreeing with your green crush as I have had one my self for a while now…wear green and others will turn green with envy!!!

Hey Autumners! It’s the first rain falling in Athens after about four months and I’m super excited. It was about time. So how did you welcome fall? What naked? Uhhhhhh…. I tried to do my best with a cozy knit, white denim and my sexy low heeled Pradas.  It was a good start because this winter I have decided that yes, I will, too, participate to the light-coloured outfit madness. And I suggest that you should also follow this trend. And to make a union. The snow-white pants! Yeah. Ok enough with my delirium and to put things straight, I really love the idea of dressing with light toned clothing in cold months and in fact I cannot imagine a single reason why I shouldn’t!

Wearing Topshop knit ( you can find it in emerald here), Current Elliott white denim, Isabel Marant belt, Prada pumps.

Great selection! I am diggin lighter colors for fall, it is time to through out the old rules 😉

I love your style! Simple but somewhat sexy..

White trousers for autumn seem like such a refreshing idea for the new season as they carry something from the summer making the  transition less harsh…you look great!

Thank u 😉

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

  Now that’s how it feels to be a star..:)
Joking guys but I have to confess: I’m not only excited.. I’m totally goose bumped being on the cover of January’s Company magazine. I’d honestly have the same feelings even with a tiny pic inside, but featured in the cover..Whoa..The amazing superblogger’s issue just hit the stands and you’ll find inside more images of me and the fellow bloggers, among them my darling Charlotte, plus our funny interviews.

A special thanks and a big kiss to all  guys in the Company who contributed for this outcome.

That’s truly the best Christmas present..:)

I told my friend from London to bring to me for Christmas.
I can’t wait to go to Greece and get this on my hands!!!

Good morning loves! I hope you’ve seen some improvement in my tanning today. I’m back to my country house for a quick four-day vacation and I am excited for spending all day burning under 40 degrees and doing nothing else!  I am a little red, I won’t hide it from you, but my pants are more! Don’t they look like a fire? J’adore…They are actually very masculine but the colour balances the outcome.  To combat the excessive heat  I’ve chosen to wear this black silky, lightweight  blouse. See how it blows up!!! That’s air-conditioning. My shoes are the guest stars. Ultra feminine and sexy. C u tomorrow…Geia!

Wearing Graham & Spencer top, Acne red hot pants, Dolce & Gabbana sandals, ASOS cuff.

 Are you looking for the perfect cropped top? Just look at your belly. Yeah, ladies this part of your gorgeous body is your style meter. 10 cm down(one palm) and it will be your favorite wardrobe piece! Mine is this one from Topshop. Not too short or too long to look proportional with my Isabel Marant skirt. The shoes are from Acne and the bag from Stella McCartney. Geia!

love this outfit….this is so…my style!!!!!!

 Denim/Current Elliott pumps/Manolo Blahnik shirt/Chloe jacket/Chloe bag/Valentino (via LuisaWorld)

If you think that I’m only a black and white person, well you’d be totally right until recently, when I witnessed myself wearing a shade clearly visible from space. Joking. Actually to set the record straight, I’ve never thought that yellow was a good  mix with my pale skin. And so it came, the post’s protagonist, the pretty flawless Chloe tweety-ish coat,  to prove that when we make rules, God laughs. And between you and me being a human buoy really feels and is fantastic!

wow i love this jacket!! the colour is absolutely amazing!

Hey guys! In my last two days I’m running like hell. Is there any planetary conjunction that makes our lives miserable? Anyway I’m getting ready for another wedding, the last I believe for the summer, so excuse me for the rush. The outfit is from the morning, yes I’m not going in leather shorts to the wedding, and is a mix with about everything of what you are going to wear  a LOT this season. Dots, leather and animal prints. Fatal combination.

Wearing Rebecca Minkoff shirt, H&M amazing shorts which by the way if you are fast you can find them in stores now and Tory Burch booties.

Perfect combo! I need those leopard Tory B booties ASAP.

Love love love the mix

Do you remember this dress? It was last season’s greatest hit. You should have seen it everywhere, even Zara once had its pattern copy pasted all over its windows. I was very proud with my acquisition but after a period of full social activity, and extreme love and hate relationship with this frock you can imagine what happened to me. Overdose. My last summer’s treasure was a blurry blue nightmare.

After a year of being separated, today something changed. I felt a little sympathy looking at it, maybe I missed the good old times we’ve  spent together and released it from its loneliness. From the moment I’ve put it on, and touched my skin its supreme silky texture I’ve realized my huge mistake. I didn’t have to put it aside, I should just change the way I wear it. Like that, i layered it over a white tank dress and added a simple leather belt which by the way this month celebrates 14 years in my possession, and voila my new shirt-dress!  Lovely…

Wearing Stella McCartney dress and Etoile Isabel Marant tank slip.

Ankle cuffs.  Tommy Ton’s eagle eye catched the evolution of the chain bracelet we all used to wear in our distant past in the streets of Paris. They look so sexy especially over these Prada heels. Geia!

I was born when the sun was in Pisces and I am naturally attracted to water. It calms me, inspires me and actually makes me feel heavenly. It’s also my main criterion for choosing vacations. Not  so with the idea of tropical islands, as with a metropolis on the sea. For example Hong Kong. Majestic. I’ve been there once in the past and I could surely say that this is the town I could live forever. In fact there is a chance to visit it in August. Small or big….we’ll see.

Today I am dressed with one of my favorite styles. Chic and comfy.I am wearing a Maje high-waisted leather skirt with side pockets and a simple white silk Zara shirt. I just love the skirts with the pockets. It’s so much comfortable and proportional to the body. The leather ones, even better. They are the most versatile items in a wardrobe. They could be mixed in million ways and look differently every time. The oversized wristlet is  from Phillip Lim. I’ve had some issues with it but now I’ve started to liking it. Worth to mention my Acne Arial wedges. Eye candy! Geia!

you inspire me!!!!! i am addicted to your blog really (everyday i check it out at least once!) plus you give me ideas on how to wear my clothes!!! EISAI THEAAAAAAAA KEEP POSTING!

THANXXXXXX……..

when i say that you R a CHIC MUSE …..i m  right….and these  pictures  are the proof !!!!!!!!!.I WANT EVERYTHING THAT YOU R WEARING!!!!!!!
BRAVO !!!!!! kisses !!!!!!

Chic style…Chic way to live…

Chic-Chimple way to live…

Dim sum after a “hard days night” at the shopping malls? Sounds divine…perfect way to end a perfect summer…

  ring/Ileana Makri bag/Valentino Rockstud(brown, black, pink, red ) via LuisaWorld.

The thing about instagram is that for some reason we assume that every single person in this world has access to it. That’s wrong. Completely. Take for example my mom. The fact that at her age she evolved into a computer geek to just follow her daughter’s chaotic sartorial adventures, doesn’t  mean that she simultaneously was initiated into the social networks. And probably doesn’t needed to.

So for my mommy and the rest who don’t have the habit of maniacally picturing their lives, like the crazy lady who’s blogging at five in the morning (me), in instagram, above are my ferocious nature loving accessories posted there yesterday. Such beauties, no?

Wow, love the bag!!

Irrelevant: I just watched a film called Jenifer’s body, starring Megan Fox, and I must warn you that the movie SUCKS. Stay away.

So today I’ve decided to display an outfit that opposes me to stripes. Lately the universe looks so flattened so why not play a little with curves? Dots seemed a good alternative and like their predecessors  flatters the majority of complexes and silhouettes . Aren’t they freshly pretty?

Wearing Topshop playsuit, Stella McCartney belt. Geia!

Like like like sto poua!Panta super thiliko.Agapame 🙂

Urgent! I need a dark circle remedy and a good spell for the evil eye. Whoever has something interesting to declare, could contact with me. Even my camera is broken. It trembles like a fish! Is there any planet retrograde? I should investigate it further. Anyway here I am, going out to a nice restaurant with my man. He is soooo sweet, he always tries to cheer me up by any means. Love you!! But there is another mood fixer that performs miracles. Fashion. In bad times I like to get dressy and this Zara skirt is one of my favorites. It’s fabricated from pleated leather and it looks unexpectedly great when layered with a transparency. Run for it. You might still find it.

Wearing top from Isabel Marant, leather skirt from Zara, pumps YSL, and handbag from  Alexander Wang. Geia!

Cute skirt, really looks good on you !

Hard to get..;=)

  Milwaukee boots/Isabel Marant(and the Memphis here), Acca leather skirt/Isabel Marant, t-shirt/Halmut Lang, fur/Isabel Marant.
Still braneless barelegged yet completely unapologetic. You guys, have to admit it, these boots are stars. They don’t need any Christmas stuffing. They are Christmas by themselves.

Anyways, the depicted outfit is a classic case of what I call “Saturday night” fever basics. Case in point, the leather shirt, the simple white tee and the ankle boot sexifiers. Apparently the aformentioned look definitely needs a fur. Why? You don’t really want to catch a cold. Right? Almost brainless.

waouh the great look

Beautiful look, way too many great items in one outfit! Love it

You are my GODDESS!

Another day, another post. But wait, can you feel it? No? It’s a haaaaappy post guys. Pure happiness. WTF? From when Marant does create coats doped up on endorphines? Like forever… maybe?

That coat looks amazing, would make me happy too!

Looking at the tittle you might assume that I’ve had a “national geographic” close encounter with endangered species and that’s…wrong! It’s simply my nickname. My inventive daddy gave it to me during my early high-school years, in a desperate attempt to convince me to go early in bed. Dear daddy that bird stuck with me forever and I’m still permanently jet lagged.

Honestly,  I AM a night owl. For sure. My activity level insanely peeks around midnight, leaving me inevitably zombie-ish in the mornings.  And yet I somehow manage to live in this time zone.

Somewhere in the world a zoo is mourning the loss of the rare greater black owl. Ready to fly? No?

those shoes are amazing!! gorgeous night owl 😉

That fur, those boots… lovely!

 Alexander Wang front slit skirt(also here and here) in size 0(size down…a lot), Acne shirt, Alexander Wang Sofia boots(and here), Topshop Boutique coat(similar here), Chanel Boy bag, Helmut Lang beanie, Celine bracelet.

Happy Friday universe. Now that I’m spreading love in the air will you smile back at me? Just a tiny teeth display…

Anyways, my limbs still have a rare allergic reaction to whatever tries to resemble them to giant wrapped burritos so I’m still brainless barelegged in the middle of November. Only this time the intergalactical Sofias do that armour thing, repelling any hostile cold simultaneously peek-a-booing naughtily from this season’s (according to my master mind) craziest skirt.  Alexander Wang is my man, one word, GENIUS. I love the center part of it. The slit is so balanced in perfection. Arghhhh…the man is the lost brother that I’ve always wished for,  can you even imagine…unlimited access to his collections? Seriously if he really has a sister…well that’s annoying.

wow, you just reinvented that skirt. again. craze

 Maison Martin Margiela/tuxedo (also check out this)  LNA/t-shirt, Balmain/denim Alaia/sandals Celine/bag Zara Men/hat Celine/bracelet House of Waris/skull earings

In a theoretical conversation with myself, asking the critical question what’s the epitome of chicness, well my answer would be this and only this: a super simple tuxedo jacket. Well…I need some company here…are you going to join this dialogue before it becomes too wacky or what?:)



You look cute as a button but so stylish at the same time, I love coming here for inspiration!

<3

a tuxedo jacket can make the plainest outfit chic. and your one is stunning!

  Lace top/Alice and Olivia(and here), leather sweatpants/Josh Goot(similar here), beanie/Helmut Lang, clutch/Jil Sander, shoes/Celine, bracelet/Celine, skull earings/House of Waris(thanks to MyTheresa)

Look, I get it. I definitely need a haircut. It’s like a resurrected Meduse furiously blooming from the bottom of my head. Beware, the girl seriously bites. But in the end, nah… It’s my pet and I’m frankly in my “I don’t care” age. The truth is that I don’t recall myself not being at a hair salon at least once per week over the past ten years. Nasty multiply if you think about it seriously. But lately I feel like detangled, freed from the curse of the pursuit of the perfect curl. So that’s me, au naturale,  a little blow-dried with a large round brush only at the end of my locks. And I kind of like it…no?

I’m loving the soft lace contrast with the leather sweatpants!

I’m loving this mix of styles, sport chic looks great on you dear!

Virginie/ Style Reload

LOL I’m at that point too, and to be frank I think the au natural looks much better than a tidier curl. Rock it gorgeous!

Din dong…Does these shoes say anything to you? Hidden treasures my girls. They’re the iconic Gucci pumps from an ancient collection, when I was a little child…They’re my mother’s!!!!Nahhhh just kidding. I recovered them from the bottoms of my closet yesterday and I immediately thought that it’s a good chance to prove to all of you that classic choices are timeless. Aren’t they still pretty? So elegant and edgy that clearly stand out of the whole outfit. And something else. I am convinced by now that the only way this H&M necklace be removed from my neck is only by surgery. I am officially obsessed. Wearing T by Alexander Wang dress and the same designer’s handbag. Geia!

you are the style godess!!!!Se parakolouthw kathe mera!!!

Love u…xx

  Isabel Marant Quidor knit, Sass & Bide sequined leggings, Jerome Dreyfuss Bobi bag.
While this pair of garments initially avoided to randomly meet each other, eventually clashed on my last day’s outing and since they’ve found love (in a hopeless place). Who said that sequins and knits don’t match? Well?

amazing! what size do you have in the knit?

Thank u Renee’
I’ve got it in size 40 because I’ve wanted it a little boxy.

In summer I prefer vacationing in major capitals, metropolis full of energy and inspiration. I usually start my day early in the morning and finish it late in the night, with no intermediate visits to the hotel. So I like to wear pieces that are easy to translate for any occasion. This dress is the perfect  representative of my travel wardrobe. Fabricated with light cotton, but long-sleeved is an all day apparel. I teamed it with my new Acne low heeled(8 cm) wedges for extra comfort. I never forget to carry a backpack (to have my hands free) with a pair of  flip-flops inside that i’ll definitely need at the end of the day. Wearing Paul & Joe’s Sister dress, Acne shoes, Alexander Wang bag. Geia!

 Topshop dungaree (check also my other favorites here), Etoile Isabel Marant Flavie top, Jerome Dreyfuss Bobi bag, Celine shoes, Topshop beanie.
File this outfit under “you ask, I make it happen”, again. So after I’d instagramed ( of course we can invent words, no?) the depicted Topshop dungaree many of you email me If I could make a post about it. Apparently the diabolical Mercury planet which, damn, turns retrograde in a couple of hours hasn’t affected our intergalaxial communication, we still have it folks, and behold your girl, me me me, strolling incognito in the most, dare I say, asexual-sexy over-all. Say what? Yes, our clothes get mutated through our mood. Haven’t you learned yet? And this dungaree is no exception.

Love this whole collection as I have been Wearing DUNGAREES FOR YEAR’S 

Love this whole collection as I have been Wearing DUNGAREES FOR YEAR’S

It was 3pm on a sunny day in downtown Athens. The center looked perfectly peaceful after all these days of riots. Christine and I met at the shopping district and started to stroll around the area. People seemed to be relaxed and happy on the streets and we’ve had a fantastic mood, talking about our future vacations. The most entertaining incident happened when we entered a well-known high-end designers store in the area. We  faced the rudest salesman in the world. He was such a caricature with an attitude like “I am raised in Buckingham palace and you are my poor cousins from Scotland”. Imagine him keeping all the way his arms folded, his chin up, admiring himself in the mirrors,  pissed off when we took a cloth from the selves and when we dare to ask(after we had both purchased numerous things) if he could put aside a dress for a day to decide, he had a crisis shouting that the item is for free, only 400 euros, and he couldn’t do that for such a negligible amount of money. We should just purchase it.  Dear prince Hali, I have heard that the palace is revamped and opened its doors for all its old habitants, so the road is open!  Funny personality…Wearing T by Alexander Wang top, the same designer’s bag and Isabel Marant pants and bracelet. Geia!

Somebody with such a huge chip on their shoulder, and might I add such a huge nose, is bound to be a bad salesman so too bad for him as we could have spent a lot more…

 Isabel Marant Lina dress, Alexander Wang Sofia boots, Jardin des Orangers beanie, Chanel bag, Zadig & Voltaire by Gaia Repossi ring, Ileana Makri serpent ring.

Hello your dress is amazing, I would buy it but Im not sure for the size, in which size did you buy it, is it true to size?
xo

Hi Gabrielle,
The dress is in 38 size. I usually size up because I love the clothes to be more loose on me. For the particular one I think that if you are a full size, size up cause its short.
I hope my complicated answer helped you:)
Happy new year

Thank you so much for your answer it very helped me : )
Happy new year too

I’ve just laid my hands on my Arial sandals after a long wait,due to strikes. I was lucky enough to find my size on sales with 40% off the original price. For me Acne is a major brand, producing great pairs of shoes, fierce and super comfy, a mission impossible in the market . Geia!

Good morning everyone! Say hello to my first parking picture. Yes, it is taken outside the Village cinemas just before entering to watch the Transformers 3 movie.  I am usually getting excited seeing sci-fi films but at the end of this one and after having a 3D  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley overdose, I had so many questions since Shutter Island. Like, what is this girl?  Is she an animated computer graphic resembling human or just an alien?  How the hell is she running  the whole way in sky-high heels? Are her legs duplicated by a prima ballerina like Black Swan and most important is this a real booty? I am joking. The girl is a stunner thanks to her good genes and her sexy attitude. For me she is the absolute beauty and I really can’t even imagine what happened to the men in the cinema.   Wearing Surface To Air top, Stella McCartney shorts, Castaner shoes, Alexander Wang bag. Geia!

Thanks to wear Castañer!

I love you blog!

I post today: http://www.facebook.com/castaner1927

 Isabel Marant oversized plaid shirt (and a darker version), Topshop Boutique coat, Joseph roll neck sweater, Jardin des Orangers beanie(in teal and grey).

Transmitting live from bed, or at the moment ” bed of pain”. I’m sick guys, really, exhaustingly sick and this post is not a usua l ” style” one. Is a pin reminder programmed to send signals to my brain cells every single time I intend to leave my head unprotected to October’s fierce nature. Don’t forget your beanie…bip bip bip…or elsey..bip bip…Damn!

Ahah, I hope you got better! Totally love this look. But GOD you must be freezing in this dress. Are you actually wearings tights!? x Romi

Romina the temperature in Greece today reached
26c so I’ll probably need sandals in a while;)

Love the look, so easy but sooo good looking! 🙂

Haaaappy Monday lil pals!
Can we take a moment and all hail Sofia, the brave boots which have been bizarrely kept as hostages for more than a month and half in customs, because they were accidentally confused with a beastie cargo of starving alligators. Beware they bite!

Where would that fuchsia fusion be without the black netty dress layered inside? In the closet!  I’ve had it about a year unworn, because every time I had tried it on, I thought there was missing something. And suddenly, like a survival kit , I’ve discovered Marant’s tank dresses and layering acquired a new attractive substance. Isn’t it super? Easy breezy wonderful. And for all of you who asked where can you find it, click here or else go to a Zara  store where I saw a similar one. It’s your choise whether you’ll go the fast way or the smart one?   Wearing Isabel Marant dresses, Dolce & Gabbana booties, Hermes bracelet. Geia!

When it comes to clubbing I really like to dress in comfort avoiding unnecessary exposures (aka Britneys). But yesterday i’ve noticed that a lot of girls have adopted a look like porn queens, barely leaving anything to imagination. They had done it all way, mixing backless, super minis, fierce decoltes and most important trasparencies. Is it the weather too hot for dressing or I am just getting older? Maybe it is a global trend that i am completely unaware of. Anyway, this is my last night’s pic, exactly before heading out. I am wearing a black silk shirt from Topshop that i have rolled it’s collar inside, leather shorts from Maje, shoes from Sergio Rossi, necklace from H&M and Alexander McQueen clutch. Geia!

THUMBS UP!!!!!!!

 Alice + Olivia leather pants, Isabel Marant shirt, Topshop booties, Celine bag.

Bam means kaput!  No matter how hard I blink my eyes, every time I open them, there it is, the “50 blah, of grey” thing. Again! It’s like a “midlife crisis” pandemia, hornyfied every single female in this planet. Common..you know that  I’m joking, surely educating yourself is the ultimate source of evolution,  but I’m just done with it.

Cuckoo confension right? Not so. Every time I’ ve given a thought to the post’s tittle there it was, THE phrase popping out again and again. 3 shades of red…lol

Keep it out of my face! Please…I’ll bite you.

Photos by Chryssi

Great outfit! Loving the red. I really want to get those pants. Is it true to size or should I get a size down / up?  Thanks heaps!

Hey R, they’re true to size but mine are in size 6 so to be a little slouchy. I usually wear 4.
xo

Amazing!
Kiss from Poland!

Those boots are so badass… Now I am starting to feel that my grey ones from last season are a bit inadequate. I need flames now, damnit! Hehe

The pic is from my last night’s outing in a club-restaurant on the beach. We had sushi for main dish but it was really bad. Like tasting a piece of paper. In Athens they still seem to ignore the price/quality relationship. Otherwise, it was a good chance reuniting with friends and dancing all night long. I’ll post soon my outfit. Geia!

sorry for your bad experience..it always depends where you dine! there are millions of places with sushi but only 3-4 high quality restos..
lovely bags all TDF!

Oh ma Queen, is it three Mcqueen in a row I see? Candy for the eyes …

At least we have eaten with our eyes…

Maximun length equals maximum impact. The dramatic silhouette of this silk dress can take your style to another level as it silent dynamism steals the spotlight.  The maxis this season are worn alone, for a simpler urbanish look, or as aforementioned with a leather gilet for an instant modernization. Wearing Wildwood dress, Jimmy Choo flat sandals, Kooba handbag, H&M necklace. Geia!

Excellent Combination …Wildwood Dress with gold jewellery!!

  Etoile Isabel Marant jacket and pants(similar here and here), Celina shoes, bag, bracelet and sunglasses. Zadig & Voltaire by Gaia Repossi ring, Ileana Makri serpent ring  and the same designer’s skull bracelet.

Either my eyesight is so blurry(again) or my depicted outfit really resembles to the sleekest wool jumpsuit ever?

But instead of answering, that rather unanswered question, let’s take a moment to digest today’s post important lesson: Best things happen by accident! Period!

Fierce! I like it.

  Isabel Marant Abadi leather coat(in 36 size Laura), Etoile Isabel Marant t-shirt, J Brand denim, Maison Martin Margiela sneakers, Carven bag, Celine sunglasses.

Does it look like a lovestruck? To your surprise it was not!

In fact when it comes to Isabel Marant usually is the same old story (with mathematical order). Shocked, digesting, obsessed. Wacky approach, no? For example the Abadi, the enormous stuffed coat resembling Bibendum (or Michelin man). I can’t really say that the first time I saw it I was actually thrilled to bits. But then it’s memory has slowly started to haunt me and eventually torture me. No,yes,no,yes. Bitch! After a week I was completely brain washed! And now I can literally live in it. Gimme some privacy please….

Hi! Could I ask your height please? I noticed you said it’s size 36, I’m just trying to gauge the size on myself 🙂 thank you!

Hey amazing Jayne,
so I’m 1.72cm and i always shop Marants in 38 cause I love them boxy. But that one was way too boxy from itself so 36 was perfect. I hope I’ve helped. If you’d like to ask me anything more please dont hesitate.
xoxoxoxo

Even if the coat it’s not among my favourites I have to admint that you look stunning with it! Love the look!
xo,Clochet

absolutely gorgeous!

That jacket is a dream.  I love it, and it looks fabulous on you!  Enjoy it!!
xo,
Ali

Great post, your blog is so lovely!
Would you maybe like to follow eachother?
Love, Anne

http://www.movieanne.com

Isabel Marant items can have that yes, no, yes, no effect but some how we end on yes!  The coat looks brilliant on you.  I just received the Isabel Marant David coat but that was a huge yes for me and love at first sight.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

The ultimate way to balance comfort with style when dressing is to coordinate a cashmere cardigan, a low-key item, with something bolder like my sequined J.Crew skirt. The result will be absolutely charming. Wearing cardigan from Gucci, Louis Vuitton shoes and Alexander McQueen clutch. Geia!

Nice shoes! I am so into wearing all the stuff I have bought in previous years as I think it is such a pitty and waist to just leave them lying there in my closet. Plus I believe that wearing things from older collections really reflects ones style instead of just being the fashion victim of each season. Mix and match really defines a true fashionista!

True. Some things are just timeless.

When It comes to London an extended, six hours at least, visit at Topshop is definitely mandatory. For me this time was a bit easier. In fact it was only a matter of seconds. Saw, blinded, fainted, grabbed and out of the door. The inflamed sexifiers were meant to get back with me…

Topshop boots. For similar check here, here and here.

Nice : )

Why on earth do men have their shirt’s collar lifted? Has anyone told them that a lifted collar pairs with masculinity? Maybe they think that it’s a confidence booster like AXE! Or that it is the ticket to be the rooster in the henhouse, the sultan in the harem,  the boss in the office or just the MAN. I hope someday they’ll understand that there is no logical reason for such annoying actions. Collars are meant to be down and not communicating with the outer space. From my perspective, I could only protest silently by having my own lifted by half(I cannot stand the idea of whole) to oposse to this trend. See how stupid it looks? Exactly to the point. Wearing J.Crew denim shirt, Current Elliott shorts, Maje belt, Dolce & Gabbana booties, Alexander McQueen bag. Geia!

Thank God there is Burberry Prorsum who has made the most comfortable high heeled sandals in the planet otherwise i would have my parachute silk pants sweep all the dirty tiles of Athens. With 35 degrees i refused to sausaging my legs into skinny jeans, so i chose to wear these airy but long, i’m ashamed that i have to say this for one more time, Isabel Marant (from her ss2008, vintage yeah)pants. The crying lady on my chest belongs to Browns Focus collections and the bag is from Alexander Wang. Geia!

I endlessly love you and completely missed you. I’m so sorry guys for disappearing from the blogosphere for such a long time but that’s the result of hitting PFW completely unprepared. No breath! The least I could do right now, besides sending to every each one of you a sweet kiss, is to start blogging like a lunatic.
Let’s go.

Great clutch!

 Karl sweatshirt, Balmain jeans, Valentino pumps, Miu Miu wristlet.

Advice seeking: Well you should probably know by now that on Saturday, the day according to my favorite astrologer/witch(in a good way) Mrs Miller that nobody should travel ( a terrifying monster moon will at least haunt us), I’m landing in Paris and I’ve practically have packed zero… So you Parisian style heroines what should I take with me? Jacket, coat, fur??? Is it damn freezing for someone who’s still sunbathing or they’re just rumors?

 

amazing outfit!!

The first photo is really cool!

Hola guapa!!

Good morning world!!! There has been already 15 days since Styleheroine has been launched and I’m ecstatic. With this chance I want to THANK all of my friends who have supported my sudden wild idea to be a blogger, and hugged my personal efforts with lots lots of love and attention. THANK you guys you are the BEST! Enough with my Oscaric speech (wow I’ve always wanted to do that). Let’s talk about outfits. You’ve probably seen these Isabel Marant denim shorts everywhere, on bloggers, editorials, actresses on your cousin and now on me. To blur a little your recent memories I’ve tried to spice it up with an asian touch by adding this Zara kimono style jacket. And the portion got ready…Isn’t it fangtastic?(Yeah True Blood started yesterday). The just caught a mermaid top is also from Marant. Snake pendant from Ileana Makri. Geia!

p.s. The shorts are shold out but you will also love this pink  jbrand cutt-off.

ZEN=MEDIDATION=RELAXATION=BALANCE=PERFECT OUTFITS
and you girl have it all…..SO keep up the EXELLENT JOB you r doing…..*

Luv u!!!!

OMG where are those pants from?! I LOVE them!!

They’re from Balmain. You can find a link on my next post. xo

ohhh my fellow Valentino Rock stud sister. Love the reptilian print and the ankle zip pants. I’ve noticed quite a few fierce pairs on you- VERY chic

So gorgeous! 🙂 xx

ok, now, that’s sick sick sick .. rock n rolla baby, You know well balmain is my dreamland, but when there are even some sick awesomeness of gold zippers.. You catch my heart!!
It would suit perfectly these €7803.00 rose quilted balmain jacket, eh? 😉

Earlier this afternoon I took my new hat and my bleached flag printed topshop shorts out for some serious action. Surprisingly I discovered an old empty railway station near my country house that I’ve never seen before. For a moment I felt like starring in a western movie, the badass chick, and started to look for something interesting…a saloon maybe? ? I had left my wild imagination run free playing around when suddenly my chick flick scenario changed to the “cowboys & aliens” film. I saw a faded figure approaching me seriously fast from the depth of the railway path. Really! Of course I didn’t wait for socializing in the middle of nowhere, and jumped into my car like Speedy Gonzales, the mighty badass….huh! Next time i’ll better play Snow White! Wearing Isabel Marant shirt, and Jimmy Choo trainers. Geia!

Iro Jill shirt, Iro leather pants, Alexander Wang Lydia clutch, Givenchy cuff.
So…how have you spent your weekend babes? Autumn vibes curled up on a sofa? Yes, London I’m talking about you! Common do tell and I’ll show you my back! Semi-naked of course. Joking. Just a prologue to introduce you to my perfectly translucent Iro shirt. Owning the aforementioned top made me think that finding the ideal transparency used to cover your upper assets is rather risky. It can look really cheap or amazingly chic. There’s no middle ground. I personally try to focus on the texture. Extra refined and super delicate. The rest between you and me are pretty much the same. I guess that nobody wears transparencies falling on a body-con way…Am i right?

Amazing  blog! U have a new follower!
I hope you like my blog too! muak!

http://byourway.wordpress.com

I think you’re right and it can be tricky but as you say, all about how you wear it – I like that the shirt is loose and the turn up cuffs add a relaxed edge

♥ ThankFifi

Really amazing shirt!

holy, i was so confused by the texture. nice find xx

The blouse is too pretty!

  The very exciting news for this fall is that Balmain somehow tries to show a more , how can I say it, accessible character by reducing the prices of the lengendary biker denim by at least half. So massfriendliness or not, heck with it, the jeans that I haven’t been able to take my eyes off of them for a couple of years are finally home. Welcome BB*!

You can find them here.

Summer officially begun for me today. I am so exhausted working intensively all year-long, that I’ve forgotten that June is going to end in a while. So this weekend escape from town is like a rejuvenating pill and nothing is more appropriate and  fresh to wear than a white lace dress. This one from Phillip Lim’s ss10 collection is my favorite.  In my fantasy world, it is my a modern light  armor, that i can wear from day to night. I added a vintage men’s belt for a more aggressive attitude. Handbag from Gucci and sandals from Christian Louboutin, soooo comfortable. Geia!

LOVE IT!

CHIC, SIMPLE, PERFECT!!!THATS MY GIRL!!!!

so beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!love it!!!!!

thank u joanna..

brilliant Evangelie!!!!!!I adore ur style!!!!!!!!

love love love….

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

  Isabel Marant leather trousers(via LouisaWorld), Acne t-shirt, Celine sunglasses, Chanel Boy bag.

Hi, 

Now that you probably have had the opportunity to wear these leather pants more than once (hopefully), how did you find them? would you buy them again?I own a pair of reds same style….

Also what size of pants are you wearing here?

Thxs,
AB

Hi AB,
I’m wearing 38 size(Marants were small in fit this year) and yes I’d definitely buy them again.

  Carven dress, Celine shoes(also check out that awesomeness) and sunglasses, Chanel bag, Ileana Makri ring.

Happy Monday little fellas! I know what are you thinking. And the answer is… of course I wear dresses. In fact I wear anything that blurs my vision and steals my heart. And since that massively patterned, or heavy crossed, dress did them both,  I’ve decided that it should be punished with in-my-wardrobe lifetime sentence. From now on, miss little Carven and I, we’ll be together foreva and eva and eva…Oh gosh…you see, Mondays always hit me hard.

I love your dress with the shoes!
So stylish 🙂

The dress with the Celineeeees….!!! Babe, you look stunning

I cry! I tried to find a pair of perfect brogues while in NY but the Celines were gone… arghhh. My only hope is that Saks Mexico will bring them soon. Fingers crossed!

very nice dress, lovely combination

http://7-sevendays.blogspot.it/

Lovely as always. I like the camera editing effect you used- very instagram esque. Greetings from London 😉

Thank you dear…a great Kiss to London…

The first photo darling is one of your best!!It could be a magazine cover at Vogue!

That’s one gorgeous dress and you look absolutely stunning in it! xx

Did you know that lace is a man repeller? Yes it sounds weird but unfortunately is the harsh reality. In a small survey I have done among friends, most of men hate lace in any form, like a top, a skirt, or even a wedding dress. Surprised? Anyway representing all the fearless fashionistas of the world I’ve informed them that, we just don’t care!!! One tip, if you are going to embrace this trend, leave  the lace to make its own statement, without any loud accessories. Geia!         Wearing Isabel Marant top and pants, Alexander Wang bag and Miu Miu shoes.

simply perfect………….

THAT’S MY STYLE !
VERY NICE COMBINED 🙂

thanx love…

  Givenchy men’s sweater (check out this amazingness) and the same designer’s bag (via LuisaWorld), Acne shirt, Current Elliott denim, Alexander Wang Lina pumps, Celine sunglasses.

Asexual definition:

1. Lacking interest in or desire for sex. The hell I’m not!

2. Relating to, produced by, or involving reproduction that occurs without the union of male and female gametes, as in binary fission or budding. Too complicated.

3. Having no evident sex. Well, that’s it!

At the risk of completely misinterpreted describing the fashion tendency, obviously I’ve picked up the dictionary. And while fashion has taken the sexless road, boys wear women’s clothes and vise versa, why do I feel so damn sexy every time I slip into men’s apparel?

Please don’t tell me that I’m completely coocoo…

Just amazing!!!

You look hot in this ‘asexual’ look! xx

Givenchy has climbed to the top of all my wishlists lately!GorgeousCheck out my new blog:http://www.asparklyhanger.blogspot.ro/!

Hi E! I love love this bag, so stunning and elegant. Any idea where I can get it in black – does it come in black? Where’d you get yours?? xx

Hi Jen, I’ve got it from LuisaWorld in Athens and if I remember correctly they have it in black. I’ll upload a link in my following post in an hour so you can contact them. I’ve tried to find it for you but I think that there’s no availability at any online store. And it’s really perfect….
Please tell me if you need any further help.
xo

Thank you so much. What do you think of this one, http://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/designer-givenchy-chain-strap-shoulder-bag-item-10250909.aspx

I like yours much better – yours is a bit chicer, this one is more old-lady like, haha! I will contact luisaworld and ask then…I live in NYC and have not seen yours anywhere! Givenchy is the best!!!

Thank you always for your kind help, you are the best! xo

Hey Jenn,
To be honest I prefer mine’s design. It’s so unique and sleek..I hope you find it and I’m sure you’ll rock it like no one else…

Isabel Marant Rodwell tasseled mid-rise skinny jeans (also check out the amazing blacks), Equipment blouse, Chrome Hearts necklace (via LuisaWorld), Manolo Blahnik pumps, Bottega Veneta clutch, Celine sunglasses.

Has the fashion world been shrinking lately or it’s just my wild imagination?

Initially I’ve thought that the biggest part of my body was just…getting bigger but after an IM fitting marathon I’ve realized that practically every single pant from her winter collection had been downsized. So size up girlfriends, it’s not you, it’s just the universe.

 

I love these pants!

Xoxo

Nice photos. The black top seems to really go well with the red skinny jeans. Thanks for sharing.

so gorg baby! love!! xxxx

9:00 am. It΄s early in the morning and the sun has risen hotter than ever. In such a warm day the only thing that crosses your mind before leaving your house is how to be saved. My personal saviour is this star patterned Etoile jumpsuit. It’s light and breezy texture feels like a piece of heaven in the summer. I added my low heeled Miu Miu pumps for extra comfort. Geia!

….the perfect style….as always ofcourse…:-)

Isabel Marant skirt (similar shape in blush) Chloe top (via LuisaWorld), Bottega Veneta clutch, Alexander Wang Oxfords, Celine sunglasses.

Since all the week will be dedicated to my IM newest acquisitions, I’ve thought what the heck with It let’s start with the unexpected. Tah dah… surprise! The balloon skirt. Hear me out though. This in not the same fluffy stuff that the school prom’s nightmares were made of. The fact of the matter is that from a certain point that particular sexifier seems completely flat. Just the usual suspect mini.  So don’t let this post be any short of new trend guide. I just fell in love with it.

 Joan Jett΄s alter ego or Flash Gordon΄s partner in crime, this Emilio Pucci top wakes up all the hidden fighter instincts. For a true statement style combine bold graphic prints like this one with ripped hotpants and bare legs. Standout with sky high pumps, a studded whristlet and you are ready to steal the spotlight. Geia!   Wearing Emillio Pucci top, Erin Wasson x RVCA hotpants, Phillip Lim whristlet.

What a lovely pair of shorts and as for the top it is absolutely fabulous!!!

Ok, everyone is so into backpacks this season and i believe not unreasonably.  Their perfectly simple shapes can be worn over almost everything , adding an aggressive touch to the total outfit. But don΄t  rush to possess your dreamy one. There are other ways…I had my moment of eureka with this Stella McCartney bucket shape handbag. I tried it΄s chains on both of my shoulders and…tah tah… behold the backpack. Actually yesterday that i tried this look , i got the most positive comments in the street for my imaginary backpack. So…just dare it. Wearing Stella McCartney jumpsuit ss10, Isabel Marant  top, Ash booties. Geia!

I want to declare that i am an affluent Isabel Marant collector, thought that probably has already passed through your mind. There are oddities about this girl.  She can team a baseball-inspired dress with ultra feminine pointy pumps, denim shorts with tailored jackets or ruffled  mini skirts with athletic tanks. In a closer look  my everyday life resembles a lot with Marant΄s collections . Full of peculiarities and diversities. From the things i crave to eat  to the people i like to speak to the outfits i choose to wear. Uniformity is just boring. Today i layered Isabel Marant dress over a netty slip,  and added the same designer’s bracelet, Alexander Wang bag and Sergio Rossi heels. Geia!

awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Carven shirt, DVF shorts, Celine shoes and sunglasses, Chanel bag, Ileana Makri ring and COOEE earings.

Hear me out lovebirds. The upcoming winter collections are completely surreal!!! While I was trying to focus on the celebrational aspect of the week, two of my girlfriends were getting married, the folks from LuisaWorld acknowledged to me that there was a breath of fresh air in-shop. And… honestly guys the following season our bank accounts will be absolutely demolished. I really had never witnessed such a massive inspirational whirlwind from the designers in my entire shopping life.  Stella’s blues are extraterrestrial, Balmain greens breathtaking, Alaia’s leopards…ok you better kill me now…and the Marants….arghhhhh…adopt me Idaho! That’s her best collection ever. And I couldn’t resist, I’ve sinned, already sinned… Isabel is the devil. That’s it!

 

 

WOW! And your Chanel… love it.

You look so chic ! I’m super curious to see what you’ve bought 

http://www.tripsandtreasures.net
new outfit post

you look incredible – next on my shopping list is a crisp white shirt – all my current ones are kinda slouchy.

♥ ThankFifi
p.s. I just bought a hat a lot like the one in the first shot – wearing it in tomorrow’s post.x

I understand exactly what you are talking about…
I am on the exact point where I cannot sleep at night thinking about what I should buy and how they will match with other stuff I already have in my closet.
Isn’t fashion life a nightmare some times or what?

Between a caipirinha and a mojito somewhere in the French riviera, Marant must have visualized this etheral dress. It’s message is clear: have fun. Wear it all day long with flat sandals, high heels or even slouchy boots. So if you are going to invest in a dress, do it with this one. It won’t disappoint you. Geia!                                             Isabel Marant dress, Phillip Lim whristlet.

Love the wristlet!!!

HOT STUFF!!!!!!LOVE IT!!!

The bad snake is the most common one. It  watches you but won΄t attack until it feels threaten. The ugly is the most dangerous. Twisted around itself this one will never establish eye contact with you, and when you show a little compassion, takes advantage of your weakness and bites. The good one is dead. Nature΄s law, the strongest survive and being good is a weakness in the jungle…………Today i am wearing pants and top from Zara, Gucci backpack, shoes Castaner. Geia!

Let me swing among those stars…I know it’s a traumatic experience to hear me singing but I’m in seventh heaven folks. In just 11 hours I’ll be literally up in the air, flying for my vacations. Even thought waking up at 2:30 in the morning simultaneously means two dark heavy bags under my eyes, I don’t really give a shit. After all these McCartneys know how to hide…

such a cute bag!!!

Nice casual outfit. The shirt is great! x Romi

Yesterday i was invited to a birthday party. Sometimes, is quite difficult to decide what to wear at small gatherings. There are many things to consider. You mustn΄t be too sexy or too edgy. For me attention-grabbing outfits are forbidden (it΄s someone else΄s day). So i΄ve picked these Isabel Marant pants that flatter my figure and i actually feel good in them.Bodysuit from American Apparel and shoes from Prada. Geia!

PERFECT!!!!!!

THANK U…SMOUTS

  Well you know how summers go…colorful pretty little blings permanently attached to our arms, non-stop, 24/7.  That’s me, that’s you, that’s summer for god sake. And since many of you have asked about my loving cords I’ve thought, what the heck, a quickie before I go into a deep, massive vacation planning, yeah in a couple of days we’re gonna fly babies, wouldn’t harm anyone. So behold, among the proud to be Greek things, the Apriati bracelets which have completely obsessed me the latest couple of weeks. Apriati is a  Greek brand which, remember this, is going to be a huge global trend. Their philosophy is so fresh, precious stones and gold mixed with silk  magical textures, bringing that cool chicness that all rad girls want. Something like the Marants of jewellery. Anyhow, I’ve chosen my favorite cords from their site to see the awesomeness itself and eventually become my cravings syndrome partner. Hehehe…I know I can be bad sometimes. 🙂

These are so cute! I love them!

Love this, so simple and summery!

http://www.creativityandchocolate.blogspot.com

These bracelets look so refined, I would love to have one. Especially the black/yellow are my favorite ones. Thanks for sharing!

XxX A.

Love these and I’m excited to see that they have a store in Mykonos as I am going there in a couple of weeks…do you have any more Greek brand recommendations that I should check out? Kate xo

Hi Kate, you should definitely go to a pharmacy store and try the Apivita products. I love their shampoos and the face masks, especially the green clay.

 …you’ll find a million reasons to get obsessed with Hakaan’s total leather burgundy looks. Dig in the massive padded hoodie or the cropped leather hyper pants . Seriously…it’s a love!

I have the same cravings 🙂 I just bought a piece of burgundy leather, can’t wait to work on it already! http://ohblabla.wordpress.com/

I love burgundy and I adore leather so this is perfect.

Yeah totally awesome. Love the color and the jacket is pretty cool but I almost fainted when I
saw the price 😀

Yes, it’s really cool! Sure you will rock it. X

  Ash booties, Roberto Cavalli dress (you can find it at Luisaworld in Greece).
Hey, hey happy Monday cyber-pals! This week starts with super exciting news. Haven’t you heard? Nasa has just landed on Mars, bringing ET..back home. Meanwhile, astrological speaking, Mercury is turning direct on the 8th of August, cooling off, for awhile, our recent illogical disorientation. Woohoo***

In other news, wedding bells keep ringing in this summer. And the side effect? Long, frivolous fishtails tearing up the dancefloors. Oh yes this time the theme was formal wedding, and this massive red-tailed Cavalli dress, only the dress, was that white day’s outfit.  Animal print enthusiasts can go anywhere…don’t you think?



Beautiful photos!

These HTC  booties, purchased from men΄s department as i am a size 11 lucky girl, are the perfect partner for my everyday

effortless outfits. I mixed it with this ultra feminine Isabel Marant stretch-lace dress layered over a white slip. Today  i have

added my beloved fringed Jimmy Choo bag. Geia!

hi….i am marias friend paulina!
i liked your outfit. i actually have the same dress and was wearing it over black… p

Hi paulina, black should be perfect with slouch boots. How do you wear it? When you΄ll come to the islands try the white with flat sandals. You will look amazing…..

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

  Emilio Pucci nubuck suede leather shoulder bag, Stella McCartnet tunic.
…the depicted awesomeness happens: a marriage between Peter Dundas'( the Norwegian artistic director of Emilio Pucci) super dark goth aesthetic with Greece’s heritage cross-body bags. Pierced and twisted yet amazingly crafted with a super soft suede leather and the traditional tassels on both bottom sides  replaced by these massive wind-swept ones. Hellish stylish and ultimately glamorous. That’s Dundas.



AWESOME BAG. LOVE IT!

  Givenchy rottweiler-print top, Balmain destroyed denim, Givenchy belt worn as a necklace, Alexander Wang Lina pointy-toes.

The latest and  last acquisition of the ultimate dog gang, was the pictured,  viciously biting my hand, naughty rottweiler. But the real scene stealers are these pants. Da pants!!! Two sizes up from my normal one just to succeed the perfect loose fit at the price of  Current Elliotts. Now that’s sales!

wow I have to admit that I was expecting to see you in an outfit like that but you definitely nailed it!

 Givenchy black chain (similar here), Chrome Hearts bracelet (love this alternative),  (also check out the Margiela’s ID stunner).

Lately chains do excite me. Huge chains precisely.

Well I do believe that your wild imagination has conjured a fantasy that would even blush Jenna Jameson but I hate to be the one to bring you down to earth: this is a fashion blog and these accessories when mentioned here are only for some styling reasons. So the above pictured ones are my latest huge addictions. Heavy, massive pure metals, smelling like tons of steel.  And I really love to sport them with about everything. From cocktail dresses to sexy cut-offs, from the morning until the sun goes down and beyond… Maybe it’s this particular versatility that I’m crazy about or maybe I should look it a lot further…But until my next obssesion…Cheers to chains!

Chrome Hearts <3

love all these chains!!

Recap in http://cravingforbarneys.com

These are so badass… Major love 😉

Much <3
XX,
Miranda

unchain my heart!

I’m a jewelry freak myself too. I always buy more jewels then clothes (my sin).
Currently on the hunt for that Celine bracelet but no where to find (???)

Vanja

Those chains excite me as well! Love them, especially the ‘alternative chain’ by Michael Kors. Xo

 Stella McCartney dress (and in total blue), Chloe sandals, Lanvin turban, Chanel Boy bag, Chrome Hearts bracelet.

You’ve asked for it…I did it. This is the exact outfit I’ve worn in the last week’s wedding, the brownish-red polka(flower) dot, mini lace Stella dress. That day was impossible my camera’s fat ass to fit into my delicate Boy bag, so my fancy moment was recreated this weekend in the typical Greek country nature ( no wonder all those funny looks from the passing joggers and their dogs).. As for my dress decision was an effort to avoid the summery white, we should always respect the bride,  but still feel effortlessly breezy and look ultimately classy in the hottest evening party/ wedding ever. That’s allt folks, now I can hear you…

Which Chrome Hearts bracelet is that? I *LOVE* IT!!  <3

I love this look and the metal chain bracelet adds the perfect touch of edginess.

Perfection of an summer outfit:)

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.

What does one wear to a Valentino Couture show? Valentino of course! I picked this little S/S18 number that matches the majestic decor of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild where the show was held. It's sweet as candy and chic as only Valentino can be.

A lip and cheek tint is THE travel essential. When you don't feel like wearing a full face of make-up, you can lightly put it on for a healthy pop of colour anywhere on your face. It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

It’s also waterproof making sure you look cute outside as well as in the water. PS! Paired with a glamorous choker from Isabel Marant.

I am in love with these light-weight body oils from Chanel that leave your body feeling supple and soft and give a beautiful healthy glow. They come in four different amazing scents depending on which mood you're in but they are all a part of the chance experience.
