by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of
this great world
you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in
the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
yet for aught i see they are as sick that surfeit
with too much as they that starve with nothing it
is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the
mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but
competency lives longer
good sentences and well pronounced
they would be better if well followed
if to do were as easy as to know what were good to
do chapels had been churches and poor men s
cottages princes palaces it is a good divine that
follows his own instructions: i can easier teach
twenty what were good to be done than be one of the
twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may
devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps
o er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
youth to skip o er the meshes of good counsel the
cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose me a husband o me the word choose i may
neither choose whom i would nor refuse whom i
dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed
by the will of a dead father is it not hard 
nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none 
your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their
death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery 
that he hath devised in these three chests of gold 
silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning
chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any
rightly but one who shall rightly love but what
warmth is there in your affection towards any of
these princely suitors that are already come 
i pray thee over-name them and as thou namest
them i will describe them and according to my
description level at my affection
first there is the neapolitan prince
ay that s a colt indeed for he doth nothing but
talk of his horse and he makes it a great
appropriation to his own good parts that he can
shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his
mother played false with a smith
then there is the county palatine
he doth nothing but frown as who should say if you
will not have me choose: he hears merry tales and
smiles not: i fear he will prove the weeping
philosopher when he grows old being so full of
unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be
married to a death s-head with a bone in his mouth
than to either of these god defend me from these
two 
how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon 
god made him and therefore let him pass for a man
in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker: but 
he why he hath a horse better than the
neapolitan s a better bad habit of frowning than
the count palatine he is every man in no man if a
throstle sing he falls straight a capering: he will
fence with his own shadow: if i should marry him i
should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me
i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i
shall never requite him
what say you then to falconbridge the young baron
of england 
you know i say nothing to him for he understands
not me nor i him: he hath neither latin french 
nor italian and you will come into the court and
swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english
he is a proper man s picture but alas who can
converse with a dumb-show how oddly he is suited 
i think he bought his doublet in italy his round
hose in france his bonnet in germany and his
behavior every where
what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour 
that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he
borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and
swore he would pay him again when he was able: i
think the frenchman became his surety and sealed
under for another
how like you the young german the duke of saxony s nephew 
very vilely in the morning when he is sober and
most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk: when
he is best he is a little worse than a man and
when he is worst he is little better than a beast:
and the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall
make shift to go without him
if he should offer to choose and choose the right
casket you should refuse to perform your father s
will if you should refuse to accept him
therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a
deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket 
for if the devil be within and that temptation
without i know he will choose it i will do any
thing nerissa ere i ll be married to a sponge
you need not fear lady the having any of these
lords: they have acquainted me with their
determinations which is indeed to return to their
home and to trouble you with no more suit unless
you may be won by some other sort than your father s
imposition depending on the caskets
if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as
chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner
of my father s will i am glad this parcel of wooers
are so reasonable for there is not one among them
but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant
them a fair departure
do you not remember lady in your father s time a
venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither
in company of the marquis of montferrat 
yes yes it was bassanio as i think he was so called
true madam: he of all the men that ever my foolish
eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady
i remember him well and i remember him worthy of
thy praise
how now what news 
servant
the four strangers seek for you madam to take
their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
fifth the prince of morocco who brings word the
prince his master will be here to-night
if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should
be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had
rather he should shrive me than wive me come 
nerissa sirrah go before
whiles we shut the gates
upon one wooer another knocks at the door
in terms of choice i am not solely led
by nice direction of a maiden s eyes 
besides the lottery of my destiny
bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
but if my father had not scanted me
and hedged me by his wit to yield myself
his wife who wins me by that means i told you 
yourself renowned prince then stood as fair
as any comer i have look d on yet
for my affection
you must take your chance 
and either not attempt to choose at all
or swear before you choose if you choose wrong
never to speak to lady afterward
in way of marriage: therefore be advised
first forward to the temple: after dinner
your hazard shall be made
i am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
our house is hell and thou a merry devil 
didst rob it of some taste of tediousness
but fare thee well there is a ducat for thee:
and launcelot soon at supper shalt thou see
lorenzo who is thy new master s guest:
give him this letter do it secretly 
and so farewell: i would not have my father
see me in talk with thee
farewell good launcelot
alack what heinous sin is it in me
to be ashamed to be my father s child 
but though i am a daughter to his blood 
i am not to his manners o lorenzo 
if thou keep promise i shall end this strife 
become a christian and thy loving wife
call you what is your will 
his words were farewell mistress nothing else
farewell and if my fortune be not crost 
i have a father you a daughter lost
who are you tell me for more certainty 
albeit i ll swear that i do know your tongue
lorenzo certain and my love indeed 
for who love i so much and now who knows
but you lorenzo whether i am yours 
here catch this casket it is worth the pains
i am glad tis night you do not look on me 
for i am much ashamed of my exchange:
but love is blind and lovers cannot see
the pretty follies that themselves commit 
for if they could cupid himself would blush
to see me thus transformed to a boy
what must i hold a candle to my shames 
they in themselves good-sooth are too too light
why tis an office of discovery love 
and i should be obscured
i will make fast the doors and gild myself
with some more ducats and be with you straight
go draw aside the curtains and discover
the several caskets to this noble prince
now make your choice
the one of them contains my picture prince:
if you choose that then i am yours withal
there take it prince and if my form lie there 
then i am yours
a gentle riddance draw the curtains go
let all of his complexion choose me so
quick quick i pray thee draw the curtain straight:
the prince of arragon hath ta en his oath 
and comes to his election presently
behold there stand the caskets noble prince:
if you choose that wherein i am contain d 
straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
but if you fail without more speech my lord 
you must be gone from hence immediately
to these injunctions every one doth swear
that comes to hazard for my worthless self
too long a pause for that which you find there
to offend and judge are distinct offices
and of opposed natures
thus hath the candle singed the moth
o these deliberate fools when they do choose 
they have the wisdom by their wit to lose
the ancient saying is no heresy 
hanging and wiving goes by destiny
come draw the curtain nerissa
where is my lady 
here: what would my lord 
madam there is alighted at your gate
a young venetian one that comes before
to signify the approaching of his lord 
from whom he bringeth sensible regreets 
to wit besides commends and courteous breath 
gifts of rich value yet i have not seen
so likely an ambassador of love:
a day in april never came so sweet 
to show how costly summer was at hand 
as this fore-spurrer comes before his lord
no more i pray thee: i am half afeard
thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee 
thou spend st such high-day wit in praising him
come come nerissa for i long to see
quick cupid s post that comes so mannerly
bassanio lord love if thy will it be 
i pray you tarry: pause a day or two
before you hazard for in choosing wrong 
i lose your company: therefore forbear awhile
there s something tells me but it is not love 
i would not lose you and you know yourself 
hate counsels not in such a quality
but lest you should not understand me well 
and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought 
i would detain you here some month or two
before you venture for me i could teach you
how to choose right but i am then forsworn 
so will i never be: so may you miss me 
but if you do you ll make me wish a sin 
that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes 
they have o erlook d me and divided me 
one half of me is yours the other half yours 
mine own i would say but if mine then yours 
and so all yours o these naughty times
put bars between the owners and their rights 
and so though yours not yours prove it so 
let fortune go to hell for it not i
i speak too long but tis to peize the time 
to eke it and to draw it out in length 
to stay you from election
upon the rack bassanio then confess
what treason there is mingled with your love
ay but i fear you speak upon the rack 
where men enforced do speak anything
well then confess and live
away then i am lock d in one of them:
if you do love me you will find me out
nerissa and the rest stand all aloof
let music sound while he doth make his choice 
then if he lose he makes a swan-like end 
fading in music: that the comparison
may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream
and watery death-bed for him he may win 
and what is music then then music is
even as the flourish when true subjects bow
to a new-crowned monarch: such it is
as are those dulcet sounds in break of day
that creep into the dreaming bridegroom s ear 
and summon him to marriage now he goes 
with no less presence but with much more love 
than young alcides when he did redeem
the virgin tribute paid by howling troy
to the sea-monster: i stand for sacrifice
the rest aloof are the dardanian wives 
with bleared visages come forth to view
the issue of the exploit go hercules 
live thou i live: with much much more dismay
i view the fight than thou that makest the fray
song
tell me where is fancy bred 
or in the heart or in the head 
how begot how nourished 
reply reply
it is engender d in the eyes 
with gazing fed and fancy dies
in the cradle where it lies
let us all ring fancy s knell
i ll begin it ding dong bell
all
ding dong bell
[aside] how all the other passions fleet to air 
as doubtful thoughts and rash-embraced despair 
and shuddering fear and green-eyed jealousy o love 
be moderate allay thy ecstasy 
in measure rein thy joy scant this excess
i feel too much thy blessing: make it less 
for fear i surfeit
you see me lord bassanio where i stand 
such as i am: though for myself alone
i would not be ambitious in my wish 
to wish myself much better yet for you
i would be trebled twenty times myself 
a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich 
that only to stand high in your account 
i might in virtue beauties livings friends 
exceed account but the full sum of me
is sum of something which to term in gross 
is an unlesson d girl unschool d unpractised 
happy in this she is not yet so old
but she may learn happier than this 
she is not bred so dull but she can learn 
happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
commits itself to yours to be directed 
as from her lord her governor her king
myself and what is mine to you and yours
is now converted: but now i was the lord
of this fair mansion master of my servants 
queen o er myself: and even now but now 
this house these servants and this same myself
are yours my lord: i give them with this ring 
which when you part from lose or give away 
let it presage the ruin of your love
and be my vantage to exclaim on you
my lord and lady it is now our time 
that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper 
to cry good joy: good joy my lord and lady 
is this true nerissa 
madam it is so you stand pleased withal
what and stake down 
so do i my lord:
they are entirely welcome
there are some shrewd contents in yon same paper 
that steals the colour from bassanio s cheek:
some dear friend dead else nothing in the world
could turn so much the constitution
of any constant man what worse and worse 
with leave bassanio: i am half yourself 
and i must freely have the half of anything
that this same paper brings you
when i was with him i have heard him swear
to tubal and to chus his countrymen 
that he would rather have antonio s flesh
than twenty times the value of the sum
that he did owe him: and i know my lord 
if law authority and power deny not 
it will go hard with poor antonio
is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble 
what sum owes he the jew 
what no more 
pay him six thousand and deface the bond 
double six thousand and then treble that 
before a friend of this description
shall lose a hair through bassanio s fault
first go with me to church and call me wife 
and then away to venice to your friend 
for never shall you lie by portia s side
with an unquiet soul you shall have gold
to pay the petty debt twenty times over:
when it is paid bring your true friend along
my maid nerissa and myself meantime
will live as maids and widows come away 
for you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer:
since you are dear bought i will love you dear
but let me hear the letter of your friend
o love dispatch all business and be gone 
i never did repent for doing good 
nor shall not now: for in companions
that do converse and waste the time together 
whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love 
there must be needs a like proportion
of lineaments of manners and of spirit 
which makes me think that this antonio 
being the bosom lover of my lord 
must needs be like my lord if it be so 
how little is the cost i have bestow d
in purchasing the semblance of my soul
from out the state of hellish misery 
this comes too near the praising of myself 
therefore no more of it: hear other things
lorenzo i commit into your hands
the husbandry and manage of my house
until my lord s return: for mine own part 
i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
to live in prayer and contemplation 
only attended by nerissa here 
until her husband and my lord s return:
there is a monastery two miles off 
and there will we abide i do desire you
not to deny this imposition 
the which my love and some necessity
now lays upon you
my people do already know my mind 
and will acknowledge you and jessica
in place of lord bassanio and myself
and so farewell till we shall meet again
i wish your ladyship all heart s content
i thank you for your wish and am well pleased
to wish it back on you: fare you well jessica
now balthasar 
as i have ever found thee honest-true 
so let me find thee still take this same letter 
and use thou all the endeavour of a man
in speed to padua: see thou render this
into my cousin s hand doctor bellario 
and look what notes and garments he doth give thee 
bring them i pray thee with imagined speed
unto the tranect to the common ferry
which trades to venice waste no time in words 
but get thee gone: i shall be there before thee
come on nerissa i have work in hand
that you yet know not of: we ll see our husbands
before they think of us
shall they see us 
they shall nerissa but in such a habit 
that they shall think we are accomplished
with that we lack i ll hold thee any wager 
when we are both accoutred like young men 
i ll prove the prettier fellow of the two 
and wear my dagger with the braver grace 
and speak between the change of man and boy
with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps
into a manly stride and speak of frays
like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies 
how honourable ladies sought my love 
which i denying they fell sick and died 
i could not do withal then i ll repent 
and wish for all that that i had not killed them 
and twenty of these puny lies i ll tell 
that men shall swear i have discontinued school
above a twelvemonth i have within my mind
a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks 
which i will practise
why shall we turn to men 
fie what a question s that 
if thou wert near a lewd interpreter 
but come i ll tell thee all my whole device
when i am in my coach which stays for us
at the park gate and therefore haste away 
for we must measure twenty miles to-day
and what hope is that i pray thee 
that were a kind of bastard hope indeed: so the
sins of my mother should be visited upon me
i shall be saved by my husband he hath made me a
christian
i ll tell my husband launcelot what you say: here he comes
nay you need not fear us lorenzo: launcelot and i
are out he tells me flatly there is no mercy for
me in heaven because i am a jew s daughter: and he
says you are no good member of the commonwealth 
for in converting jews to christians you raise the
price of pork
past all expressing it is very meet
the lord bassanio live an upright life 
for having such a blessing in his lady 
he finds the joys of heaven here on earth 
and if on earth he do not mean it then
in reason he should never come to heaven
why if two gods should play some heavenly match
and on the wager lay two earthly women 
and portia one there must be something else
pawn d with the other for the poor rude world
hath not her fellow
nay but ask my opinion too of that
nay let me praise you while i have a stomach
well i ll set you forth
from both my lord bellario greets your grace
he attendeth here hard by 
to know your answer whether you ll admit him
i did my lord
i am informed thoroughly of the cause
which is the merchant here and which the jew 
is your name shylock 
of a strange nature is the suit you follow 
yet in such rule that the venetian law
cannot impugn you as you do proceed
you stand within his danger do you not 
do you confess the bond 
then must the jew be merciful
the quality of mercy is not strain d 
it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath: it is twice blest 
it blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
the throned monarch better than his crown 
his sceptre shows the force of temporal power 
the attribute to awe and majesty 
wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings 
but mercy is above this sceptred sway 
it is enthroned in the hearts of kings 
it is an attribute to god himself 
and earthly power doth then show likest god s
when mercy seasons justice therefore jew 
though justice be thy plea consider this 
that in the course of justice none of us
should see salvation: we do pray for mercy 
and that same prayer doth teach us all to render
the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much
to mitigate the justice of thy plea 
which if thou follow this strict court of venice
must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there
is he not able to discharge the money 
it must not be there is no power in venice
can alter a decree established:
twill be recorded for a precedent 
and many an error by the same example
will rush into the state: it cannot be
i pray you let me look upon the bond
shylock there s thrice thy money offer d thee
why this bond is forfeit 
and lawfully by this the jew may claim
a pound of flesh to be by him cut off
nearest the merchant s heart be merciful:
take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond
why then thus it is:
you must prepare your bosom for his knife
for the intent and purpose of the law
hath full relation to the penalty 
which here appeareth due upon the bond
therefore lay bare your bosom
it is so are there balance here to weigh
the flesh 
have by some surgeon shylock on your charge 
to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
it is not so express d: but what of that 
twere good you do so much for charity
you merchant have you any thing to say 
your wife would give you little thanks for that 
if she were by to hear you make the offer
tis well you offer it behind her back 
the wish would make else an unquiet house
a pound of that same merchant s flesh is thine:
the court awards it and the law doth give it
and you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
the law allows it and the court awards it
tarry a little there is something else
this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood 
the words expressly are a pound of flesh: 
take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh 
but in the cutting it if thou dost shed
one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods
are by the laws of venice confiscate
unto the state of venice
thyself shalt see the act:
for as thou urgest justice be assured
thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest
soft 
the jew shall have all justice soft no haste:
he shall have nothing but the penalty
therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more
but just a pound of flesh: if thou cut st more
or less than a just pound be it but so much
as makes it light or heavy in the substance 
or the division of the twentieth part
of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn
but in the estimation of a hair 
thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate
why doth the jew pause take thy forfeiture
he hath refused it in the open court:
he shall have merely justice and his bond
thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture 
to be so taken at thy peril jew
tarry jew:
the law hath yet another hold on you
it is enacted in the laws of venice 
if it be proved against an alien
that by direct or indirect attempts
he seek the life of any citizen 
the party gainst the which he doth contrive
shall seize one half his goods the other half
comes to the privy coffer of the state 
and the offender s life lies in the mercy
of the duke only gainst all other voice
in which predicament i say thou stand st 
for it appears by manifest proceeding 
that indirectly and directly too
thou hast contrived against the very life
of the defendant and thou hast incurr d
the danger formerly by me rehearsed
down therefore and beg mercy of the duke
ay for the state not for antonio
what mercy can you render him antonio 
art thou contented jew what dost thou say 
clerk draw a deed of gift
i humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
i must away this night toward padua 
and it is meet i presently set forth
he is well paid that is well satisfied 
and i delivering you am satisfied
and therein do account myself well paid:
my mind was never yet more mercenary
i pray you know me when we meet again:
i wish you well and so i take my leave
you press me far and therefore i will yield
give me your gloves i ll wear them for your sake 
and for your love i ll take this ring from you:
do not draw back your hand i ll take no more 
and you in love shall not deny me this
i will have nothing else but only this 
and now methinks i have a mind to it
i see sir you are liberal in offers
you taught me first to beg and now methinks
you teach me how a beggar should be answer d
that scuse serves many men to save their gifts
an if your wife be not a mad-woman 
and know how well i have deserved the ring 
she would not hold out enemy for ever 
for giving it to me well peace be with you 
inquire the jew s house out give him this deed
and let him sign it: we ll away to-night
and be a day before our husbands home:
this deed will be well welcome to lorenzo
that cannot be:
his ring i do accept most thankfully:
and so i pray you tell him: furthermore 
i pray you show my youth old shylock s house
sir i would speak with you
i ll see if i can get my husband s ring 
which i did make him swear to keep for ever
[aside to female] thou mayst i warrant
we shall have old swearing
that they did give the rings away to men 
but we ll outface them and outswear them too
away make haste: thou knowist where i will tarry
come good sir will you show me to this house 
in such a night
did thisbe fearfully o ertrip the dew
and saw the lion s shadow ere himself
and ran dismay d away
in such a night
medea gather d the enchanted herbs
that did renew old aeson
in such a night
did young lorenzo swear he loved her well 
stealing her soul with many vows of faith
and ne er a true one
i would out-night you did no body come 
but hark i hear the footing of a man
i am never merry when i hear sweet music
that light we see is burning in my hall
how far that little candle throws his beams 
so shines a good deed in a naughty world
when the moon shone we did not see the candle
so doth the greater glory dim the less:
a substitute shines brightly as a king
unto the king be by and then his state
empties itself as doth an inland brook
into the main of waters music hark 
it is your music madam of the house
nothing is good i see without respect:
methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day
silence bestows that virtue on it madam
the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark 
when neither is attended and i think
the nightingale if she should sing by day 
when every goose is cackling would be thought
no better a musician than the wren
how many things by season season d are
to their right praise and true perfection 
peace ho the moon sleeps with endymion
and would not be awaked
he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo 
by the bad voice
we have been praying for our husbands healths 
which speed we hope the better for our words
are they return d 
go in nerissa 
give order to my servants that they take
no note at all of our being absent hence 
nor you lorenzo jessica nor you
this night methinks is but the daylight sick 
it looks a little paler: tis a day 
such as the day is when the sun is hid
let me give light but let me not be light 
for a light wife doth make a heavy husband 
and never be bassanio so for me:
but god sort all you are welcome home my lord
you should in all sense be much bound to him
for as i hear he was much bound for you
sir you are very welcome to our house:
it must appear in other ways than words 
therefore i scant this breathing courtesy
a quarrel ho already what s the matter 
what talk you of the posy or the value 
you swore to me when i did give it you 
that you would wear it till your hour of death
and that it should lie with you in your grave:
though not for me yet for your vehement oaths 
you should have been respective and have kept it
gave it a judge s clerk no god s my judge 
the clerk will ne er wear hair on s face that had it
ay if a woman live to be a man
you were to blame i must be plain with you 
to part so slightly with your wife s first gift:
a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
and so riveted with faith unto your flesh
i gave my love a ring and made him swear
never to part with it and here he stands 
i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
that the world masters now in faith gratiano 
you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
an twere to me i should be mad at it
what ring gave you my lord 
not that i hope which you received of me
even so void is your false heart of truth
by heaven i will ne er come in your bed
until i see the ring
nor i in yours
till i again see mine
if you had known the virtue of the ring 
or half her worthiness that gave the ring 
or your own honour to contain the ring 
you would not then have parted with the ring
what man is there so much unreasonable 
if you had pleased to have defended it
with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty
to urge the thing held as a ceremony 
nerissa teaches me what to believe:
i ll die for t but some woman had the ring
let not that doctor e er come near my house:
since he hath got the jewel that i loved 
and that which you did swear to keep for me 
i will become as liberal as you 
i ll not deny him any thing i have 
no not my body nor my husband s bed:
know him i shall i am well sure of it:
lie not a night from home watch me like argus:
if you do not if i be left alone 
now by mine honour which is yet mine own 
i ll have that doctor for my bedfellow
and i his clerk therefore be well advised
how you do leave me to mine own protection
sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding
mark you but that 
in both my eyes he doubly sees himself 
in each eye one: swear by your double self 
and there s an oath of credit
then you shall be his surety give him this
and bid him keep it better than the other
i had it of him: pardon me bassanio 
for by this ring the doctor lay with me
and pardon me my gentle gratiano 
for that same scrubbed boy the doctor s clerk 
in lieu of this last night did lie with me
speak not so grossly you are all amazed:
here is a letter read it at your leisure 
it comes from padua from bellario:
there you shall find that portia was the doctor 
nerissa there her clerk: lorenzo here
shall witness i set forth as soon as you
and even but now return d i have not yet
enter d my house antonio you are welcome 
and i have better news in store for you
than you expect: unseal this letter soon 
there you shall find three of your argosies
are richly come to harbour suddenly:
you shall not know by what strange accident
i chanced on this letter
ay but the clerk that never means to do it 
unless he live until he be a man
how now lorenzo 
my clerk hath some good comforts too for you
ay and i ll give them him without a fee
there do i give to you and jessica 
from the rich jew a special deed of gift 
after his death of all he dies possess d of
it is almost morning 
and yet i am sure you are not satisfied
of these events at full let us go in 
and charge us there upon inter gatories 
and we will answer all things faithfully
my noble father 
i do perceive here a divided duty:
to you i am bound for life and education 
my life and education both do learn me
how to respect you you are the lord of duty 
i am hitherto your daughter: but here s my husband 
and so much duty as my mother show d
to you preferring you before her father 
so much i challenge that i may profess
due to the moor my lord
nor i i would not there reside 
to put my father in impatient thoughts
by being in his eye most gracious duke 
to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear 
and let me find a charter in your voice 
to assist my simpleness
that i did love the moor to live with him 
my downright violence and storm of fortunes
may trumpet to the world: my heart s subdued
even to the very quality of my lord:
i saw othello s visage in his mind 
and to his honour and his valiant parts
did i my soul and fortunes consecrate
so that dear lords if i be left behind 
a moth of peace and he go to the war 
the rites for which i love him are bereft me 
and i a heavy interim shall support
by his dear absence let me go with him
i thank you valiant cassio
what tidings can you tell me of my lord 
o but i fear how lost you company 
alas she has no speech
you have little cause to say so
o fie upon thee slanderer 
you shall not write my praise
what wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst
praise me 
come on assay there s one gone to the harbour 
i am not merry but i do beguile
the thing i am by seeming otherwise
come how wouldst thou praise me 
well praised how if she be black and witty 
worse and worse
how if fair and foolish 
these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i 
the alehouse what miserable praise hast thou for
her that s foul and foolish 
o heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best
but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
woman indeed one that in the authority of her
merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself 
to do what 
o most lame and impotent conclusion do not learn
of him emilia though he be thy husband how say
you cassio is he not a most profane and liberal
counsellor 
let s meet him and receive him
my dear othello 
the heavens forbid
but that our loves and comforts should increase 
even as our days do grow 
what s the matter 
good morrow good lieutenant: i am sorry
for your displeasure but all will sure be well
the general and his wife are talking of it 
and she speaks for you stoutly: the moor replies 
that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus 
and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
he might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you
and needs no other suitor but his likings
to take the safest occasion by the front
to bring you in again
pray you come in 
i will bestow you where you shall have time
to speak your bosom freely
be thou assured good cassio i will do
all my abilities in thy behalf
good madam do: i warrant it grieves my husband 
as if the case were his
o that s an honest fellow do not doubt cassio 
but i will have my lord and you again
as friendly as you were
i know t i thank you you do love my lord:
you have known him long and be you well assured
he shall in strangeness stand no further off
than in a polite distance
do not doubt that before emilia here
i give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee 
if i do vow a friendship i ll perform it
to the last article: my lord shall never rest 
i ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience 
his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift 
i ll intermingle every thing he does
with cassio s suit: therefore be merry cassio 
for thy solicitor shall rather die
than give thy cause away
madam here comes my lord
why stay and hear me speak
well do your discretion
how now my lord 
i have been talking with a suitor here 
a man that languishes in your displeasure
why your lieutenant cassio good my lord 
if i have any grace or power to move you 
his present reconciliation take 
for if he be not one that truly loves you 
that errs in ignorance and not in cunning 
i have no judgment in an honest face:
i prithee call him back
ay sooth so humbled
that he hath left part of his grief with me 
to suffer with him good love call him back
but shall t be shortly 
shall t be to-night at supper 
to-morrow dinner then 
why then to-morrow night or tuesday morn 
on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn:
i prithee name the time but let it not
exceed three days: in faith he s penitent 
and yet his trespass in our common reason 
save that they say the wars must make examples
out of their best is not almost a fault
to incur a private cheque when shall he come 
tell me othello: i wonder in my soul 
what you would ask me that i should deny 
or stand so mammering on what michael cassio 
that came a-wooing with you and so many a time 
when i have spoke of you dispraisingly 
hath ta en your part to have so much to do
to bring him in trust me i could do much 
why this is not a boon 
tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves 
or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm 
or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
to your own person: nay when i have a suit
wherein i mean to touch your love indeed 
it shall be full of poise and difficult weight
and fearful to be granted
shall i deny you no: farewell my lord
emilia come be as your fancies teach you 
whate er you be i am obedient
how now my dear othello 
your dinner and the generous islanders
by you invited do attend your presence
why do you speak so faintly 
are you not well 
faith that s with watching twill away again:
let me but bind it hard within this hour
it will be well
i am very sorry that you are not well
i am glad i have found this napkin:
this was her first remembrance from the moor:
my wayward husband hath a hundred times
woo d me to steal it but she so loves the token 
for he conjured her she should ever keep it 
that she reserves it evermore about her
to kiss and talk to i ll have the work ta en out 
and give t iago: what he will do with it
heaven knows not i 
i nothing but to please his fantasy
do not you chide i have a thing for you
ha 
o is that all what will you give me now
for the same handkerchief 
what handkerchief 
why that the moor first gave to desdemona 
that which so often you did bid me steal
no faith she let it drop by negligence
and to the advantage i being here took t up
look here it is
what will you do with t that you have been
so earnest
to have me filch it 
if it be not for some purpose of import 
give t me again: poor lady she ll run mad
when she shall lack it
do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies 
why man 
go to: where lodges he 
can any thing be made of this 
can you inquire him out and be edified by report 
seek him bid him come hither: tell him i have
moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well
where should i lose that handkerchief emilia 
i know not madam
believe me i had rather have lost my purse
full of crusadoes: and but my noble moor
is true of mind and made of no such baseness
as jealous creatures are it were enough
to put him to ill thinking
is he not jealous 
who he i think the sun where he was born
drew all such humours from him
look where he comes
i will not leave him now till cassio
be call d to him
how is t with you my lord
well my good lord
it yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow
you may indeed say so 
for twas that hand that gave away my heart
i cannot speak of this come now your promise
i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you
here my lord
i have it not about me
no indeed my lord
is t possible 
indeed is t true 
then would to god that i had never seen t 
why do you speak so startingly and rash 
heaven bless us 
it is not lost but what an if it were 
i say it is not lost
why so i can sir but i will not now
this is a trick to put me from my suit:
pray you let cassio be received again
come come 
you ll never meet a more sufficient man
i pray talk me of cassio
a man that all his time
hath founded his good fortunes on your love 
shared dangers with you 
in sooth you are to blame
is not this man jealous 
i ne er saw this before
sure there s some wonder in this handkerchief:
i am most unhappy in the loss of it
tis not a year or two shows us a man:
they are all but stomachs and we all but food 
to eat us hungerly and when they are full 
they belch us look you cassio and my husband 
how now good cassio what s the news with you 
alas thrice-gentle cassio 
my advocation is not now in tune 
my lord is not my lord nor should i know him 
were he in favour as in humour alter d
so help me every spirit sanctified 
as i have spoken for you all my best
and stood within the blank of his displeasure
for my free speech you must awhile be patient:
what i can do i will and more i will
than for myself i dare: let that suffice you
he went hence but now 
and certainly in strange unquietness
i prithee do so
something sure of state 
either from venice or some unhatch d practise
made demonstrable here in cyprus to him 
hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases
men s natures wrangle with inferior things 
though great ones are their object tis even so 
for let our finger ache and it indues
our other healthful members even to that sense
of pain: nay we must think men are not gods 
nor of them look for such observances
as fit the bridal beshrew me much emilia 
i was unhandsome warrior as i am 
arraigning his unkindness with my soul 
but now i find i had suborn d the witness 
and he s indicted falsely
pray heaven it be state-matters as you think 
and no conception nor no jealous toy
concerning you
alas the day i never gave him cause
but jealous souls will not be answer d so 
they are not ever jealous for the cause 
but jealous for they are jealous: tis a monster
begot upon itself born on itself
heaven keep that monster from othello s mind 
lady amen
i will go seek him cassio walk hereabout:
if i do find him fit i ll move your suit
and seek to effect it to my uttermost
save you friend cassio 
and i was going to your lodging cassio
what keep a week away seven days and nights 
eight score eight hours and lovers absent hours 
more tedious than the dial eight score times 
o weary reckoning 
o cassio whence came this 
this is some token from a newer friend:
to the felt absence now i feel a cause:
is t come to this well well
why whose is it 
leave you wherefore 
why i pray you 
but that you do not love me
i pray you bring me on the way a little 
and say if i shall see you soon at night
tis very good i must be circumstanced
let the devil and his dam haunt you what did you
mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now 
i was a fine fool to take it i must take out the
work a likely piece of work that you should find
it in your chamber and not know who left it there 
this is some minx s token and i must take out the
work there give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever
you had it i ll take out no work on t
an you ll come to supper to-night you may an you
will not come when you are next prepared for
and what s the news good cousin lodovico 
cousin there s fall n between him and my lord
an unkind breach: but you shall make all well
my lord 
a most unhappy one: i would do much
to atone them for the love i bear to cassio
my lord 
what is he angry 
trust me i am glad on t
my lord 
why sweet othello 
i have not deserved this
i will not stay to offend you
my lord 
nor ever heard nor ever did suspect
but then i saw no harm and then i heard
each syllable that breath made up between them
never my lord
never
never my lord
i durst my lord to wager she is honest 
lay down my soul at stake: if you think other 
remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom
if any wretch have put this in your head 
let heaven requite it with the serpent s curse 
for if she be not honest chaste and true 
there s no man happy the purest of their wives
is foul as slander
my lord what is your will 
what is your pleasure 
what horrible fancy s this 
upon my knees what doth your speech import 
i understand a fury in your words
but not the words
your wife my lord your true
and loyal wife
heaven doth truly know it
to whom my lord with whom how am i false 
alas the heavy day why do you weep 
am i the motive of these tears my lord 
if haply you my father do suspect
an instrument of this your calling back 
lay not your blame on me: if you have lost him 
why i have lost him too
i hope my noble lord esteems me honest
alas what ignorant sin have i committed 
by heaven you do me wrong
no as i am a christian:
if to preserve this vessel for my lord
from any other foul unlawful touch
be not to be a strumpet i am none
no as i shall be saved
o heaven forgive us 
alas what does this gentleman conceive 
how do you madam how do you my good lady 
faith half asleep
good madam what s the matter with my lord 
with who 
why with my lord madam
who is thy lord 
he that is yours sweet lady
i have none: do not talk to me emilia 
i cannot weep nor answer have i none 
but what should go by water prithee tonight
lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember 
and call thy husband hither
here s a change indeed 
tis meet i should be used so very meet
how have i been behaved that he might stick
the small st opinion on my least misuse 
i cannot tell those that do teach young babes
do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
he might have chid me so for in good faith 
i am a child to chiding
alas iago my lord hath so bewhored her
thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her 
as true hearts cannot bear
am i that name iago 
such as she says my lord did say i was
he call d her whore: a beggar in his drink
could not have laid such terms upon his callat
i do not know i am sure i am none such
hath she forsook so many noble matches 
her father and her country and her friends 
to be call d whore would it not make one weep 
it is my wretched fortune
nay heaven doth know
i will be hang d if some eternal villain 
some busy and insinuating rogue 
some cogging cozening slave to get some office 
have not devised this slander i ll be hang d else
if any such there be heaven pardon him 
a halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones 
why should he call her whore who keeps her company 
what place what time what form what likelihood 
the moor s abused by some most villanous knave 
some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow
o heaven that such companions thou ldst unfold 
and put in every honest hand a whip
to lash the rascals naked through the world
even from the east to the west 
o fie upon them some such squire he was
that turn d your wit the seamy side without 
and made you to suspect me with the moor
o good iago 
what shall i do to win my lord again 
good friend go to him for by this light of heaven 
i know not how i lost him here i kneel:
if e er my will did trespass gainst his love 
either in discourse of thought or actual deed 
or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense 
delighted them in any other form 
or that i do not yet and ever did
and ever will though he do shake me off
to beggarly divorcement love him dearly 
comfort forswear me unkindness may do much 
and his unkindness may defeat my life 
but never taint my love i cannot say whore: 
it does abhor me now i speak the word 
to do the act that might the addition earn
not the world s mass of vanity could make me
if twere no other 
your honour is most welcome
my lord 
i will my lord
how goes it now he looks gentler than he did
he says he will return incontinent:
he hath commanded me to go to bed 
and bade me to dismiss you
dismiss me 
it was his bidding: therefore good emilia
give me my nightly wearing and adieu:
we must not now displease him
i would you had never seen him 
so would not i my love doth so approve him 
that even his stubbornness his cheques his frowns 
prithee unpin me have grace and favour in them
i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed
all s one good faith how foolish are our minds 
if i do die before thee prithee shroud me
in one of those same sheets
come come you talk
my mother had a maid call d barbara:
she was in love and he she loved proved mad
and did forsake her: she had a song of willow 
an old thing twas but it express d her fortune 
and she died singing it: that song to-night
will not go from my mind i have much to do 
but to go hang my head all at one side 
and sing it like poor barbara prithee dispatch
shall i go fetch your night-gown 
no unpin me here
this lodovico is a proper man
a very handsome man
he speaks well
i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot
to palestine for a touch of his nether lip
[singing] the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree 
sing all a green willow:
her hand on her bosom her head on her knee 
sing willow willow willow:
the fresh streams ran by her and murmur d her moans 
sing willow willow willow 
her salt tears fell from her and soften d the stones 
lay by these: 
sing willow willow willow 
prithee hie thee he ll come anon: 
sing all a green willow must be my garland
let nobody blame him his scorn i approve -
nay that s not next hark who is t that knocks 
it s the wind
[singing] i call d my love false love but what
said he then 
sing willow willow willow:
if i court moe women you ll couch with moe men 
so get thee gone good night ate eyes do itch 
doth that bode weeping 
tis neither here nor there
i have heard it said so o these men these men 
dost thou in conscience think tell me emilia 
that there be women do abuse their husbands
in such gross kind 
there be some such no question
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world 
why would not you 
no by this heavenly light 
nor i neither by this heavenly light 
i might do t as well i the dark
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world 
the world s a huge thing: it is a great price
for a small vice
in troth i think thou wouldst not
in troth i think i should and undo t when i had
done marry i would not do such a thing for a
joint-ring nor for measures of lawn nor for
gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty
exhibition but for the whole world why who would
not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
monarch i should venture purgatory for t
beshrew me if i would do such a wrong
for the whole world
why the wrong is but a wrong i the world: and
having the world for your labour tis a wrong in your
own world and you might quickly make it right
i do not think there is any such woman
yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would
store the world they played for
but i do think it is their husbands faults
if wives do fall: say that they slack their duties 
and pour our treasures into foreign laps 
or else break out in peevish jealousies 
throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us 
or scant our former having in despite 
why we have galls and though we have some grace 
yet have we some revenge let husbands know
their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
and have their palates both for sweet and sour 
as husbands have what is it that they do
when they change us for others is it sport 
i think it is: and doth affection breed it 
i think it doth: is t frailty that thus errs 
it is so too: and have not we affections 
desires for sport and frailty as men have 
then let them use us well: else let them know 
the ills we do their ills instruct us so
good night good night: heaven me such uses send 
not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend 
what is the matter ho who is t that cried 
o my dear cassio my sweet cassio o cassio 
cassio cassio 
alas he faints o cassio cassio cassio 
las what s the matter what s the matter husband 
alas good gentleman alas good cassio 
he supp d at my house but i therefore shake not
fie fie upon thee strumpet 
i am no strumpet but of life as honest
as you that thus abuse me
as i foh fie upon thee 
who s there othello 
will you come to bed my lord 
ay my lord
alas my lord what do you mean by that 
talk you of killing 
then heaven
have mercy on me 
if you say so i hope you will not kill me
and yet i fear you for you are fatal then
when your eyes roll so: why i should fear i know not 
since guiltiness i know not but yet i feel i fear
they are loves i bear to you
that death s unnatural that kills for loving
alas why gnaw you so your nether lip 
some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
these are portents but yet i hope i hope 
they do not point on me
i will so what s the matter 
no by my life and soul 
send for the man and ask him
ay but not yet to die
then lord have mercy on me 
and have you mercy too i never did
offend you in my life never loved cassio
but with such general warranty of heaven
as i might love: i never gave him token
he found it then 
i never gave it him: send for him hither 
let him confess a truth
what my lord 
how unlawfully 
he will not say so
o my fear interprets: what is he dead 
alas he is betray d and i undone
o banish me my lord but kill me not 
kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night 
but half an hour 
but while i say one prayer 
my lord my lord what ho my lord my lord 
[within] what ho my lord my lord 
[within] o good my lord i would speak a word with you 
[within] i do beseech you
that i may speak with you o good my lord 
o my good lord yonder s foul murders done 
but now my lord

help help ho help o lady speak again 
sweet desdemona o sweet mistress speak 
a guiltless death i die
o who hath done this deed 
nobody i myself farewell
commend me to my kind lord: o farewell 
alas who knows 
she said so: i must needs report the truth
o the more angel she 
and you the blacker devil 
thou dost belie her and thou art a devil
thou art rash as fire to say
that she was false: o she was heavenly true 
my husband 
that she was false to wedlock 
my husband 
my husband 
o mistress villany hath made mocks with love 
my husband say that she was false 
if he say so may his pernicious soul
rot half a grain a day he lies to the heart:
she was too fond of her most filthy bargain
do thy worst:
this deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
than thou wast worthy her
thou hast not half that power to do me harm
as i have to be hurt o gull o dolt 
as ignorant as dirt thou hast done a deed 
i care not for thy sword i ll make thee known 
though i lost twenty lives help help ho help 
the moor hath kill d my mistress murder murder 
o are you come iago you have done well 
that men must lay their murders on your neck
disprove this villain if thou be st a man:
he says thou told st him that his wife was false:
i know thou didst not thou rt not such a villain:
speak for my heart is full
but did you ever tell him she was false 
you told a lie an odious damned lie 
upon my soul a lie a wicked lie
she false with cassio did you say with cassio 
i will not charm my tongue i am bound to speak:
my mistress here lies murder d in her bed 
all
o heavens forfend 
and your reports have set the murder on
villany villany villany 
i think upon t i think: i smell t: o villany 
i thought so then: i ll kill myself for grief: 
o villany villany 
good gentlemen let me have leave to speak:
tis proper i obey him but not now
perchance iago i will ne er go home
nay lay thee down and roar 
for thou hast kill d the sweetest innocent
that e er did lift up eye
o heaven o heavenly powers 
twill out twill out: i peace 
no i will speak as liberal as the north:
let heaven and men and devils let them all 
all all cry shame against me yet i ll speak
i will not
o thou dull moor that handkerchief thou speak st of
i found by fortune and did give my husband 
for often with a solemn earnestness 
more than indeed belong d to such a trifle 
he begg d of me to steal it
she give it cassio no alas i found it 
and i did give t my husband
by heaven i do not i do not gentlemen
o murderous coxcomb what should such a fool
do with so good a woman 
ay ay: o lay me by my mistress side
what did thy song bode lady 
hark canst thou hear me i will play the swan
and die in music
willow willow willow 
moor she was chaste she loved thee cruel moor 
so come my soul to bliss as i speak true 
so speaking as i think i die i die
set down set down your honourable load 
if honour may be shrouded in a hearse 
whilst i awhile obsequiously lament
the untimely fall of virtuous lancaster
poor key-cold figure of a holy king 
pale ashes of the house of lancaster 
thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood 
be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost 
to hear the lamentations of poor anne 
wife to thy edward to thy slaughter d son 
stabb d by the selfsame hand that made these wounds 
lo in these windows that let forth thy life 
i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes 
cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it 
cursed the blood that let this blood from hence 
more direful hap betide that hated wretch 
that makes us wretched by the death of thee 
than i can wish to adders spiders toads 
or any creeping venom d thing that lives 
if ever he have child abortive be it 
prodigious and untimely brought to light 
whose ugly and unnatural aspect
may fright the hopeful mother at the view 
and that be heir to his unhappiness 
if ever he have wife let her he made
a miserable by the death of him
as i am made by my poor lord and thee 
come now towards chertsey with your holy load 
taken from paul s to be interred there 
and still as you are weary of the weight 
rest you whiles i lament king henry s corse
what black magician conjures up this fiend 
to stop devoted charitable deeds 
what do you tremble are you all afraid 
alas i blame you not for you are mortal 
and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell 
thou hadst but power over his mortal body 
his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone
foul devil for god s sake hence and trouble us not 
for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell 
fill d it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds 
behold this pattern of thy butcheries
o gentlemen see see dead henry s wounds
open their congeal d mouths and bleed afresh 
blush blush thou lump of foul deformity 
for tis thy presence that exhales this blood
from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells 
thy deed inhuman and unnatural 
provokes this deluge most unnatural
o god which this blood madest revenge his death 
o earth which this blood drink st revenge his death 
either heaven with lightning strike the
murderer dead 
or earth gape open wide and eat him quick 
as thou dost swallow up this good king s blood
which his hell-govern d arm hath butchered 
villain thou know st no law of god nor man:
no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
o wonderful when devils tell the truth 
vouchsafe defused infection of a man 
for these known evils but to give me leave 
by circumstance to curse thy cursed self
fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make
no excuse current but to hang thyself
and by despairing shouldst thou stand excused 
for doing worthy vengeance on thyself 
which didst unworthy slaughter upon others
why then they are not dead:
but dead they are and devilish slave by thee
why then he is alive
in thy foul throat thou liest: queen margaret saw
thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood 
the which thou once didst bend against her breast 
but that thy brothers beat aside the point
thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind
which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
didst thou not kill this king 
dost grant me hedgehog then god grant me too
thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed 
o he was gentle mild and virtuous 
he is in heaven where thou shalt never come
and thou unfit for any place but hell
some dungeon
ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest 
i hope so
thou art the cause and most accursed effect
if i thought that i tell thee homicide 
these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks
black night o ershade thy day and death thy life 
i would i were to be revenged on thee
it is a quarrel just and reasonable 
to be revenged on him that slew my husband
his better doth not breathe upon the earth
name him
why that was he
where is he 
would it were mortal poison for thy sake 
never hung poison on a fouler toad
out of my sight thou dost infect my eyes
would they were basilisks to strike thee dead 
arise dissembler: though i wish thy death 
i will not be the executioner
i have already
i would i knew thy heart
i fear me both are false
well well put up your sword
that shall you know hereafter
all men i hope live so
to take is not to give
what is it 
with all my heart and much it joys me too 
to see you are become so penitent
tressel and berkeley go along with me
tis more than you deserve 
but since you teach me how to flatter you 
imagine i have said farewell already
if he were dead what would betide of me 
the loss of such a lord includes all harm
oh he is young and his minority
is put unto the trust of richard gloucester 
a man that loves not me nor none of you
it is determined not concluded yet:
but so it must be if the king miscarry
the countess richmond good my lord of derby
to your good prayers will scarcely say amen
yet derby notwithstanding she s your wife 
and loves not me be you good lord assured
i hate not you for her proud arrogance
derby
i do beseech you either not believe
the envious slanders of her false accusers 
or if she be accused in true report 
bear with her weakness which i think proceeds
from wayward sickness and no grounded malice
what likelihood of his amendment lords 
god grant him health did you confer with him 
would all were well but that will never be
i fear our happiness is at the highest
brother of gloucester you mistake the matter
the king of his own royal disposition 
and not provoked by any suitor else 
aiming belike at your interior hatred 
which in your outward actions shows itself
against my kindred brothers and myself 
makes him to send that thereby he may gather
the ground of your ill-will and so remove it
come come we know your meaning brother
gloucester 
you envy my advancement and my friends :
god grant we never may have need of you 
by him that raised me to this careful height
from that contented hap which i enjoy d 
i never did incense his majesty
against the duke of clarence but have been
an earnest advocate to plead for him
my lord you do me shameful injury 
falsely to draw me in these vile suspects
my lord of gloucester i have too long borne
your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
by heaven i will acquaint his majesty
with those gross taunts i often have endured
i had rather be a country servant-maid
than a great queen with this condition 
to be thus taunted scorn d and baited at:
small joy have i in being england s queen
and lessen d be that small god i beseech thee 
thy honour state and seat is due to me
out devil i remember them too well:
thou slewest my husband henry in the tower 
and edward my poor son at tewksbury
yea and much better blood than his or thine
a murderous villain and so still thou art
which god revenge 
hie thee to hell for shame and leave the world 
thou cacodemon there thy kingdom is
as little joy my lord as you suppose
you should enjoy were you this country s king 
as little joy may you suppose in me
that i enjoy being the queen thereof
a little joy enjoys the queen thereof 
for i am she and altogether joyless
i can no longer hold me patient
hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out
in sharing that which you have pill d from me 
which of you trembles not that looks on me 
if not that i being queen you bow like subjects 
yet that by you deposed you quake like rebels 
o gentle villain do not turn away 
but repetition of what thou hast marr d 
that will i make before i let thee go
i was but i do find more pain in banishment
than death can yield me here by my abode
a husband and a son thou owest to me 
and thou a kingdom all of you allegiance:
the sorrow that i have by right is yours 
and all the pleasures you usurp are mine
so just is god to right the innocent
what were you snarling all before i came 
ready to catch each other by the throat 
and turn you all your hatred now on me 
did york s dread curse prevail so much with heaven 
that henry s death my lovely edward s death 
their kingdom s loss my woful banishment 
could all but answer for that peevish brat 
can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven 
why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses 
if not by war by surfeit die your king 
as ours by murder to make him a king 
edward thy son which now is prince of wales 
for edward my son which was prince of wales 
die in his youth by like untimely violence 
thyself a queen for me that was a queen 
outlive thy glory like my wretched self 
long mayst thou live to wail thy children s loss 
and see another as i see thee now 
deck d in thy rights as thou art stall d in mine 
long die thy happy days before thy death 
and after many lengthen d hours of grief 
die neither mother wife nor england s queen 
rivers and dorset you were standers by 
and so wast thou lord hastings when my son
was stabb d with bloody daggers: god i pray him 
that none of you may live your natural age 
but by some unlook d accident cut off 
and leave out thee stay dog for thou shalt hear me
if heaven have any grievous plague in store
exceeding those that i can wish upon thee 
o let them keep it till thy sins be ripe 
and then hurl down their indignation
on thee the troubler of the poor world s peace 
the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul 
thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest 
and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends 
no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine 
unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils 
thou elvish-mark d abortive rooting hog 
thou that wast seal d in thy nativity
the slave of nature and the son of hell 
thou slander of thy mother s heavy womb 
thou loathed issue of thy father s loins 
thou rag of honour thou detested 
richard 
i call thee not
why so i did but look d for no reply
o let me make the period to my curse 
thus have you breathed your curse against yourself
poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune 
why strew st thou sugar on that bottled spider 
whose deadly web ensnareth thee about 
fool fool thou whet st a knife to kill thyself
the time will come when thou shalt wish for me
to help thee curse that poisonous bunchback d toad
foul shame upon you you have all moved mine
to serve me well you all should do me duty 
teach me to be your queen and you my subjects:
o serve me well and teach yourselves that duty 
peace master marquess you are malapert:
your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current
o that your young nobility could judge
what twere to lose it and be miserable 
they that stand high have many blasts to shake them 
and if they fall they dash themselves to pieces
and turns the sun to shade alas alas 
witness my son now in the shade of death 
whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
hath in eternal darkness folded up
your aery buildeth in our aery s nest
o god that seest it do not suffer it 
as it was won with blood lost be it so 
urge neither charity nor shame to me:
uncharitably with me have you dealt 
and shamefully by you my hopes are butcher d
my charity is outrage life my shame
and in that shame still live my sorrow s rage
o princely buckingham i ll kiss thy hand 
in sign of league and amity with thee:
now fair befal thee and thy noble house 
thy garments are not spotted with our blood 
nor thou within the compass of my curse
i ll not believe but they ascend the sky 
and there awake god s gentle-sleeping peace
o buckingham take heed of yonder dog 
look when he fawns he bites and when he bites 
his venom tooth will rankle to the death:
have not to do with him beware of him 
sin death and hell have set their marks on him 
and all their ministers attend on him
what dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel 
and soothe the devil that i warn thee from 
o but remember this another day 
when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow 
and say poor margaret was a prophetess 
live each of you the subjects to his hate 
and he to yours and all of you to god s 
i never did her any to my knowledge
catesby we come lords will you go with us 
here hastings i will never more remember
our former hatred so thrive i and mine 
a holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
i would to god all strifes were well compounded
my sovereign liege i do beseech your majesty
to take our brother clarence to your grace
all seeing heaven what a world is this 
no boy
boy
why do you wring your hands and beat your breast 
and cry o clarence my unhappy son 
girl
why do you look on us and shake your head 
and call us wretches orphans castaways
if that our noble father be alive 
my pretty cousins you mistake me much 
i do lament the sickness of the king
as loath to lose him not your father s death 
it were lost sorrow to wail one that s lost
boy
then grandam you conclude that he is dead
the king my uncle is to blame for this:
god will revenge it whom i will importune
with daily prayers all to that effect
girl
and so will i
peace children peace the king doth love you well:
incapable and shallow innocents 
you cannot guess who caused your father s death
boy
grandam we can for my good uncle gloucester
told me the king provoked by the queen 
devised impeachments to imprison him :
and when my uncle told me so he wept 
and hugg d me in his arm and kindly kiss d my cheek 
bade me rely on him as on my father 
and he would love me dearly as his child
oh that deceit should steal such gentle shapes 
and with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile 
he is my son yea and therein my shame 
yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit
boy
think you my uncle did dissemble grandam 
ay boy
boy
i cannot think it hark what noise is this 
oh who shall hinder me to wail and weep 
to chide my fortune and torment myself 
i ll join with black despair against my soul 
and to myself become an enemy
what means this scene of rude impatience 
to make an act of tragic violence:
edward my lord your son our king is dead
why grow the branches now the root is wither d 
why wither not the leaves the sap being gone 
if you will live lament if die be brief 
that our swift-winged souls may catch the king s 
or like obedient subjects follow him
to his new kingdom of perpetual rest
ah so much interest have i in thy sorrow
as i had title in thy noble husband 
i have bewept a worthy husband s death 
and lived by looking on his images:
but now two mirrors of his princely semblance
are crack d in pieces by malignant death 
and i for comfort have but one false glass 
which grieves me when i see my shame in him
thou art a widow yet thou art a mother 
and hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
but death hath snatch d my husband from mine arms 
and pluck d two crutches from my feeble limbs 
edward and clarence o what cause have i 
thine being but a moiety of my grief 
to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries 
boy
good aunt you wept not for our father s death 
how can we aid you with our kindred tears 
girl
our fatherless distress was left unmoan d 
your widow-dolour likewise be unwept 
give me no help in lamentation 
i am not barren to bring forth complaints
all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes 
that i being govern d by the watery moon 
may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world 
oh for my husband for my dear lord edward 
children
oh for our father for our dear lord clarence 
alas for both both mine edward and clarence 
what stay had i but edward and he s gone
children
what stay had we but clarence and he s gone
what stays had i but they and they are gone
was never widow had so dear a loss 
children
were never orphans had so dear a loss 
was never mother had so dear a loss 
alas i am the mother of these moans 
their woes are parcell d mine are general
she for an edward weeps and so do i 
i for a clarence weep so doth not she:
these babes for clarence weep and so do i 
i for an edward weep so do not they:
alas you three on me threefold distress d 
pour all your tears i am your sorrow s nurse 
and i will pamper it with lamentations
god bless thee and put meekness in thy mind 
love charity obedience and true duty 
with all our harts
i long with all my heart to see the prince:
i hope he is much grown since last i saw him
but i hear no they say my son of york
hath almost overta en him in his growth
york
ay mother but i would not have it so
why my young cousin it is good to grow
york
grandam one night as we did sit at supper 
my uncle rivers talk d how i did grow
more than my brother: ay quoth my uncle
gloucester 
small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace: 
and since methinks i would not grow so fast 
because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste
good faith good faith the saying did not hold
in him that did object the same to thee 
he was the wretched st thing when he was young 
so long a-growing and so leisurely 
that if this rule were true he should be gracious
archbishop of york
why madam so no doubt he is
i hope he is but yet let mothers doubt
york
now by my troth if i had been remember d 
i could have given my uncle s grace a flout 
to touch his growth nearer than he touch d mine
how my pretty york i pray thee let me hear it
york
marry they say my uncle grew so fast
that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
twas full two years ere i could get a tooth
grandam this would have been a biting jest
i pray thee pretty york who told thee this 
york
grandam his nurse
his nurse why she was dead ere thou wert born
york
if twere not she i cannot tell who told me
a parlous boy: go to you are too shrewd
archbishop of york
good madam be not angry with the child
pitchers have ears
archbishop of york
here comes a messenger what news 
how fares the prince 
what is thy news then 
who hath committed them 
for what offence 
ay me i see the downfall of our house 
the tiger now hath seized the gentle hind 
insulting tyranny begins to jet
upon the innocent and aweless throne:
welcome destruction death and massacre 
i see as in a map the end of all
accursed and unquiet wrangling days 
how many of you have mine eyes beheld 
my husband lost his life to get the crown 
and often up and down my sons were toss d 
for me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
and being seated and domestic broils
clean over-blown themselves the conquerors
make war upon themselves blood against blood 
self against self: o preposterous
and frantic outrage end thy damned spleen 
or let me die to look on death no more 
come come my boy we will to sanctuary
madam farewell
i ll go along with you
you have no cause
archbishop of york
my gracious lady go 
and thither bear your treasure and your goods
for my part i ll resign unto your grace
the seal i keep: and so betide to me
as well i tender you and all of yours 
come i ll conduct you to the sanctuary
who m eets us here my niece plantagenet
led in the hand of her kind aunt of gloucester 
now for my life she s wandering to the tower 
on pure heart s love to greet the tender princes
daughter well met
god give your graces both
a happy and a joyful time of day 
as much to you good sister whither away 
no farther than the tower and as i guess 
upon the like devotion as yourselves 
to gratulate the gentle princes there
kind sister thanks: we ll enter all together
and in good time here the lieutenant comes
master lieutenant pray you by your leave 
how doth the prince and my young son of york 
brakenbury
right well dear madam by your patience 
i may not suffer you to visit them 
the king hath straitly charged the contrary
the king why who s that 
brakenbury
i cry you mercy: i mean the lord protector
the lord protect him from that kingly title 
hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me 
i am their mother who should keep me from them 
i am their fathers mother i will see them
their aunt i am in law in love their mother:
then bring me to their sights i ll bear thy blame
and take thy office from thee on my peril
brakenbury
no madam no i may not leave it so:
i am bound by oath and therefore pardon me
o cut my lace in sunder that my pent heart
may have some scope to beat or else i swoon
with this dead-killing news 
despiteful tidings o unpleasing news 
o dorset speak not to me get thee hence 
death and destruction dog thee at the heels 
thy mother s name is ominous to children
if thou wilt outstrip death go cross the seas 
and live with richmond from the reach of hell
go hie thee hie thee from this slaughter-house 
lest thou increase the number of the dead 
and make me die the thrall of margaret s curse 
nor mother wife nor england s counted queen
o ill-dispersing wind of misery 
o my accursed womb the bed of death 
a cockatrice hast thou hatch d to the world 
whose unavoided eye is murderous
and i in all unwillingness will go
i would to god that the inclusive verge
of golden metal that must round my brow
were red-hot steel to sear me to the brain 
anointed let me be with deadly venom 
and die ere men can say god save the queen 
go go poor soul i envy not thy glory
to feed my humour wish thyself no harm
no why when he that is my husband now
came to me as i follow d henry s corse 
when scarce the blood was well wash d from his hands
which issued from my other angel husband
and that dead saint which then i weeping follow d 
o when i say i look d on richard s face 
this was my wish: be thou quoth i accursed 
for making me so young so old a widow 
and when thou wed st let sorrow haunt thy bed 
and be thy wife if any be so mad 
as miserable by the life of thee
as thou hast made me by my dear lord s death 
lo ere i can repeat this curse again 
even in so short a space my woman s heart
grossly grew captive to his honey words
and proved the subject of my own soul s curse 
which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest 
for never yet one hour in his bed
have i enjoy d the golden dew of sleep 
but have been waked by his timorous dreams
besides he hates me for my father warwick 
and will no doubt shortly be rid of me
poor heart adieu i pity thy complaining
no more than from my soul i mourn for yours
farewell thou woful welcomer of glory 
adieu poor soul that takest thy leave of it 
go thou to richmond and good fortune guide thee 
go thou to richard and good angels guard thee 
go thou to sanctuary and good thoughts possess thee 
i to my grave where peace and rest lie with me 
eighty odd years of sorrow have i seen 
and each hour s joy wrecked with a week of teen
stay yet look back with me unto the tower
pity you ancient stones those tender babes
whom envy hath immured within your walls 
rough cradle for such little pretty ones 
rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow
for tender princes use my babies well 
so foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell
so now prosperity begins to mellow
and drop into the rotten mouth of death
here in these confines slily have i lurk d 
to watch the waning of mine adversaries
a dire induction am i witness to 
and will to france hoping the consequence
will prove as bitter black and tragical
withdraw thee wretched margaret: who comes here 
ah my young princes ah my tender babes 
my unblown flowers new-appearing sweets 
if yet your gentle souls fly in the air
and be not fix d in doom perpetual 
hover about me with your airy wings
and hear your mother s lamentation 
hover about her say that right for right
hath dimm d your infant morn to aged night
so many miseries have crazed my voice 
that my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb 
edward plantagenet why art thou dead 
plantagenet doth quit plantagenet
edward for edward pays a dying debt
wilt thou o god fly from such gentle lambs 
and throw them in the entrails of the wolf 
when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done 
when holy harry died and my sweet son
blind sight dead life poor mortal living ghost 
woe s scene world s shame grave s due by life usurp d 
brief abstract and record of tedious days 
rest thy unrest on england s lawful earth 
unlawfully made drunk with innocents blood 
o that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
as thou canst yield a melancholy seat 
then would i hide my bones not rest them here
o who hath any cause to mourn but i 
if ancient sorrow be most reverend 
give mine the benefit of seniory 
and let my woes frown on the upper hand
if sorrow can admit society 
tell o er your woes again by viewing mine:
i had an edward till a richard kill d him 
i had a harry till a richard kill d him:
thou hadst an edward till a richard kill d him 
thou hadst a richard till a richard killed him 
i had a richard too and thou didst kill him 
i had a rutland too thou holp st to kill him
thou hadst a clarence too and richard kill d him
from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
a hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
that dog that had his teeth before his eyes 
to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood 
that foul defacer of god s handiwork 
that excellent grand tyrant of the earth 
that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls 
thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves
o upright just and true-disposing god 
how do i thank thee that this carnal cur
preys on the issue of his mother s body 
and makes her pew-fellow with others moan 
o harry s wife triumph not in my woes 
god witness with me i have wept for thine
bear with me i am hungry for revenge 
and now i cloy me with beholding it
thy edward he is dead that stabb d my edward:
thy other edward dead to quit my edward 
young york he is but boot because both they
match not the high perfection of my loss:
thy clarence he is dead that kill d my edward 
and the beholders of this tragic play 
the adulterate hastings rivers vaughan grey 
untimely smother d in their dusky graves
richard yet lives hell s black intelligencer 
only reserved their factor to buy souls
and send them thither: but at hand at hand 
ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray
to have him suddenly convey d away
cancel his bond of life dear god i prey 
that i may live to say the dog is dead 
o thou didst prophesy the time would come
that i should wish for thee to help me curse
that bottled spider that foul bunch-back d toad 
i call d thee then vain flourish of my fortune 
i call d thee then poor shadow painted queen 
the presentation of but what i was 
the flattering index of a direful pageant 
one heaved a-high to be hurl d down below 
a mother only mock d with two sweet babes 
a dream of what thou wert a breath a bubble 
a sign of dignity a garish flag 
to be the aim of every dangerous shot 
a queen in jest only to fill the scene
where is thy husband now where be thy brothers 
where are thy children wherein dost thou joy 
who sues to thee and cries god save the queen 
where be the bending peers that flatter d thee 
where be the thronging troops that follow d thee 
decline all this and see what now thou art:
for happy wife a most distressed widow 
for joyful mother one that wails the name 
for queen a very caitiff crown d with care 
for one being sued to one that humbly sues 
for one that scorn d at me now scorn d of me 
for one being fear d of all now fearing one 
for one commanding all obey d of none
thus hath the course of justice wheel d about 
and left thee but a very prey to time 
having no more but thought of what thou wert 
to torture thee the more being what thou art
thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not
usurp the just proportion of my sorrow 
now thy proud neck bears half my burthen d yoke 
from which even here i slip my weary neck 
and leave the burthen of it all on thee
farewell york s wife and queen of sad mischance:
these english woes will make me smile in france
o thou well skill d in curses stay awhile 
and teach me how to curse mine enemies 
forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days 
compare dead happiness with living woe 
think that thy babes were fairer than they were 
and he that slew them fouler than he is:
bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
revolving this will teach thee how to curse
my words are dull o quicken them with thine 
thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine
why should calamity be full of words 
windy attorneys to their client woes 
airy succeeders of intestate joys 
poor breathing orators of miseries 
let them have scope: though what they do impart
help not all yet do they ease the heart
if so then be not tongue-tied: go with me
and in the breath of bitter words let s smother
my damned son which thy two sweet sons smother d
i hear his drum: be copious in exclaims
o she that might have intercepted thee 
by strangling thee in her accursed womb
from all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done 
hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown 
where should be graven if that right were right 
the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown 
and the dire death of my two sons and brothers 
tell me thou villain slave where are my children 
thou toad thou toad where is thy brother clarence 
and little ned plantagenet his son 
where is kind hastings rivers vaughan grey 
art thou my son 
then patiently hear my impatience
o let me speak 
i will be mild and gentle in my speech
art thou so hasty i have stay d for thee 
god knows in anguish pain and agony
no by the holy rood thou know st it well 
thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell
a grievous burthen was thy birth to me 
tetchy and wayward was thy infancy 
thy school-days frightful desperate wild and furious 
thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous 
thy age confirm d proud subdued bloody 
treacherous 
more mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred:
what comfortable hour canst thou name 
that ever graced me in thy company 
i prithee hear me speak
hear me a word 
for i shall never speak to thee again
either thou wilt die by god s just ordinance 
ere from this war thou turn a conqueror 
or i with grief and extreme age shall perish
and never look upon thy face again
therefore take with thee my most heavy curse 
which in the day of battle tire thee more
than all the complete armour that thou wear st 
my prayers on the adverse party fight 
and there the little souls of edward s children
whisper the spirits of thine enemies
and promise them success and victory
bloody thou art bloody will be thy end 
shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend
though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse
abides in me i say amen to all
i have no more sons of the royal blood
for thee to murder: for my daughters richard 
they shall be praying nuns not weeping queens 
and therefore level not to hit their lives
and must she die for this o let her live 
and i ll corrupt her manners stain her beauty 
slander myself as false to edward s bed 
throw over her the veil of infamy:
so she may live unscarr d of bleeding slaughter 
i will confess she was not edward s daughter
to save her life i ll say she is not so
and only in that safety died her brothers
no to their lives bad friends were contrary
true when avoided grace makes destiny:
my babes were destined to a fairer death 
if grace had bless d thee with a fairer life
cousins indeed and by their uncle cozen d
of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life
whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts 
thy head all indirectly gave direction:
no doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart 
to revel in the entrails of my lambs
but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame 
my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
till that my nails were anchor d in thine eyes 
and i in such a desperate bay of death 
like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft 
rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom
what good is cover d with the face of heaven 
to be discover d that can do me good 
up to some scaffold there to lose their heads 
flatter my sorrows with report of it 
tell me what state what dignity what honour 
canst thou demise to any child of mine 
be brief lest that be process of thy kindness
last longer telling than thy kindness date
my daughter s mother thinks it with her soul
that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
so from thy soul s love didst thou love her brothers 
and from my heart s love i do thank thee for it
say then who dost thou mean shall be her king 
what thou 
how canst thou woo her 
and wilt thou learn of me 
send to her by the man that slew her brothers 
a pair of bleeding-hearts thereon engrave
edward and york then haply she will weep:
therefore present to her as sometime margaret
did to thy father steep d in rutland s blood 
a handkerchief which say to her did drain
the purple sap from her sweet brother s body
and bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith
if this inducement force her not to love 
send her a story of thy noble acts 
tell her thou madest away her uncle clarence 
her uncle rivers yea and for her sake 
madest quick conveyance with her good aunt anne
there is no other way
unless thou couldst put on some other shape 
and not be richard that hath done all this
nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee 
having bought love with such a bloody spoil
what were i best to say her father s brother
would be her lord or shall i say her uncle 
or he that slew her brothers and her uncles 
under what title shall i woo for thee 
that god the law my honour and her love 
can make seem pleasing to her tender years 
which she shall purchase with still lasting war
that at her hands which the king s king forbids
to wail the tide as her mother doth
but how long shall that title ever last 
but how long fairly shall her sweet lie last 
so long as hell and richard likes of it
but she your subject loathes such sovereignty
an honest tale speeds best being plainly told
plain and not honest is too harsh a style
o no my reasons are too deep and dead 
too deep and dead poor infants in their grave
harp on it still shall i till heart-strings break
profaned dishonour d and the third usurp d
by nothing for this is no oath:
the george profaned hath lost his holy honour 
the garter blemish d pawn d his knightly virtue 
the crown usurp d disgraced his kingly glory
if something thou wilt swear to be believed 
swear then by something that thou hast not wrong d
tis full of thy foul wrongs
thy life hath that dishonour d
thyself thyself misusest
god s wrong is most of all
if thou hadst fear d to break an oath by him 
the unity the king thy brother made
had not been broken nor my brother slain:
if thou hadst fear d to break an oath by him 
the imperial metal circling now thy brow 
had graced the tender temples of my child 
and both the princes had been breathing here 
which now two tender playfellows to dust 
thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms
what canst thou swear by now 
that thou hast wronged in the time o erpast 
for i myself have many tears to wash
hereafter time for time past wrong d by thee
the children live whose parents thou hast
slaughter d 
ungovern d youth to wail it in their age 
the parents live whose children thou hast butcher d 
old wither d plants to wail it with their age
swear not by time to come for that thou hast
misused ere used by time misused o erpast
shall i be tempted of the devil thus 
shall i forget myself to be myself 
but thou didst kill my children
shall i go win my daughter to thy will 
i go write to me very shortly
and you shall understand from me her mind
richard thy wife that wretched anne thy wife 
that never slept a quiet hour with thee 
now fills thy sleep with perturbations
to-morrow in the battle think on me 
and fall thy edgeless sword: despair and die 
thou quiet soul sleep thou a quiet sleep
dream of success and happy victory 
thy adversary s wife doth pray for thee
ghost of male
the last was i that helped thee to the crown 
the last was i that felt thy tyranny:
o in the battle think on buckingham 
and die in terror of thy guiltiness 
dream on dream on of bloody deeds and death:
fainting despair despairing yield thy breath 
i died for hope ere i could lend thee aid:
but cheer thy heart and be thou not dismay d:
god and good angel fight on richmond s side 
and richard falls in height of all his pride
finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur 
hath love in thy old blood no living fire 
edward s seven sons whereof thyself art one 
were as seven vials of his sacred blood 
or seven fair branches springing from one root:
some of those seven are dried by nature s course 
some of those branches by the destinies cut 
but thomas my dear lord my life my gloucester 
one vial full of edward s sacred blood 
one flourishing branch of his most royal root 
is crack d and all the precious liquor spilt 
is hack d down and his summer leaves all faded 
by envy s hand and murder s bloody axe
ah gaunt his blood was thine that bed that womb 
that metal that self-mould that fashion d thee
made him a man and though thou livest and breathest 
yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
in some large measure to thy father s death 
in that thou seest thy wretched brother die 
who was the model of thy father s life
call it not patience gaunt it is despair:
in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter d 
thou showest the naked pathway to thy life 
teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
that which in mean men we intitle patience
is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts
what shall i say to safeguard thine own life 
the best way is to venge my gloucester s death
where then alas may i complain myself 
why then i will farewell old gaunt
thou goest to coventry there to behold
our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight:
o sit my husband s wrongs on hereford s spear 
that it may enter butcher mowbray s breast 
or if misfortune miss the first career 
be mowbray s sins so heavy in his bosom 
they may break his foaming courser s back 
and throw the rider headlong in the lists 
a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford 
farewell old gaunt: thy sometimes brother s wife
with her companion grief must end her life
yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls 
not with the empty hollowness but weight:
i take my leave before i have begun 
for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done
commend me to thy brother edmund york
lo this is all: nay yet depart not so 
though this be all do not so quickly go 
i shall remember more bid him ah what 
with all good speed at plashy visit me
alack and what shall good old york there see
but empty lodgings and unfurnish d walls 
unpeopled offices untrodden stones 
and what hear there for welcome but my groans 
therefore commend me let him not come there 
to seek out sorrow that dwells every where
desolate desolate will i hence and die:
the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye
lord marshal
my lord aumerle is harry hereford arm d 
how fares our noble uncle lancaster 
to please the king i did to please myself
i cannot do it yet i know no cause
why i should welcome such a guest as grief 
save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
as my sweet richard: yet again methinks 
some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune s womb 
is coming towards me and my inward soul
with nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves 
more than with parting from my lord the king
it may be so but yet my inward soul
persuades me it is otherwise: howe er it be 
i cannot but be sad so heavy sad
as though on thinking on no thought i think 
makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink
tis nothing less: conceit is still derived
from some forefather grief mine is not so 
for nothing had begot my something grief 
or something hath the nothing that i grieve:
tis in reversion that i do possess 
but what it is that is not yet known what
i cannot name tis nameless woe i wot
why hopest thou so tis better hope he is 
for his designs crave haste his haste good hope:
then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp d 
now god in heaven forbid 
so green thou art the midwife to my woe 
and bolingbroke my sorrow s dismal heir:
now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy 
and i a gasping new-deliver d mother 
have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow join d
who shall hinder me 
i will despair and be at enmity
with cozening hope: he is a flatterer 
a parasite a keeper back of death 
who gently would dissolve the bands of life 
which false hope lingers in extremity
with signs of war about his aged neck:
o full of careful business are his looks 
uncle for god s sake speak comfortable words
what sport shall we devise here in this garden 
to drive away the heavy thought of care 
lady
madam we ll play at bowls
twill make me think the world is full of rubs 
and that my fortune rubs against the bias
lady
madam we ll dance
my legs can keep no measure in delight 
when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
therefore no dancing girl some other sport
lady
madam we ll tell tales
of sorrow or of joy 
lady
of either madam
of neither girl:
for of joy being altogether wanting 
it doth remember me the more of sorrow 
or if of grief being altogether had 
it adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
for what i have i need not to repeat 
and what i want it boots not to complain
lady
madam i ll sing
tis well that thou hast cause
but thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep
lady
i could weep madam would it do you good
and i could sing would weeping do me good 
and never borrow any tear of thee
but stay here come the gardeners:
let s step into the shadow of these trees
my wretchedness unto a row of pins 
they ll talk of state for every one doth so
against a change woe is forerun with woe
gardener
go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks 
which like unruly children make their sire
stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:
give some supportance to the bending twigs
go thou and like an executioner 
cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays 
that look too lofty in our commonwealth:
all must be even in our government
you thus employ d i will go root away
the noisome weeds which without profit suck
the soil s fertility from wholesome flowers
servant
why should we in the compass of a pale
keep law and form and due proportion 
showing as in a model our firm estate 
when our sea-walled garden the whole land 
is full of weeds her fairest flowers choked up 
her fruit-trees all upturned her hedges ruin d 
her knots disorder d and her wholesome herbs
swarming with caterpillars 
gardener
hold thy peace:
he that hath suffer d this disorder d spring
hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
the weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter 
that seem d in eating him to hold him up 
are pluck d up root and all by bolingbroke 
i mean the earl of wiltshire bushy green
servant
what are they dead 
gardener
they are and bolingbroke
hath seized the wasteful king o what pity is it
that he had not so trimm d and dress d his land
as we this garden we at time of year
do wound the bark the skin of our fruit-trees 
lest being over-proud in sap and blood 
with too much riches it confound itself:
had he done so to great and growing men 
they might have lived to bear and he to taste
their fruits of duty: superfluous branches
we lop away that bearing boughs may live:
had he done so himself had borne the crown 
which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down
servant
what think you then the king shall be deposed 
gardener
depress d he is already and deposed
tis doubt he will be: letters came last night
to a dear friend of the good duke of york s 
that tell black tidings
o i am press d to death through want of speaking 
thou old adam s likeness set to dress this garden 
how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news 
what eve what serpent hath suggested thee
to make a second fall of cursed man 
why dost thou say king richard is deposed 
darest thou thou little better thing than earth 
divine his downfall say where when and how 
camest thou by this ill tidings speak thou wretch
gardener
pardon me madam: little joy have i
to breathe this news yet what i say is true
king richard he is in the mighty hold
of bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh d:
in your lord s scale is nothing but himself 
and some few vanities that make him light 
but in the balance of great bolingbroke 
besides himself are all the english peers 
and with that odds he weighs king richard down
post you to london and you will find it so 
i speak no more than every one doth know
nimble mischance that art so light of foot 
doth not thy embassage belong to me 
and am i last that knows it o thou think st
to serve me last that i may longest keep
thy sorrow in my breast come ladies go 
to meet at london london s king in woe
what was i born to this that my sad look
should grace the triumph of great bolingbroke 
gardener for telling me these news of woe 
pray god the plants thou graft st may never grow
gardener
poor queen so that thy state might be no worse 
i would my skill were subject to thy curse
here did she fall a tear here in this place
i ll set a bank of rue sour herb of grace:
rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen 
in the remembrance of a weeping queen
this way the king will come this is the way
to julius caesar s ill-erected tower 
to whose flint bosom my condemned lord
is doom d a prisoner by proud bolingbroke:
here let us rest if this rebellious earth
have any resting for her true king s queen
but soft but see or rather do not see 
my fair rose wither: yet look up behold 
that you in pity may dissolve to dew 
and wash him fresh again with true-love tears
ah thou the model where old troy did stand 
thou map of honour thou king richard s tomb 
and not king richard thou most beauteous inn 
why should hard-favour d grief be lodged in thee 
when triumph is become an alehouse guest 
what is my richard both in shape and mind
transform d and weaken d hath bolingbroke deposed
thine intellect hath he been in thy heart 
the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw 
and wounds the earth if nothing else with rage
to be o erpower d and wilt thou pupil-like 
take thy correction mildly kiss the rod 
and fawn on rage with base humility 
which art a lion and a king of beasts 
and must we be divided must we part 
banish us both and send the king with me
then whither he goes thither let me go
so longest way shall have the longest moans
give me mine own again twere no good part
to take on me to keep and kill thy heart
so now i have mine own again be gone 
that i might strive to kill it with a groan
my lord you told me you would tell the rest 
when weeping made you break the story off 
of our two cousins coming into london
at that sad stop my lord 
where rude misgovern d hands from windows tops
threw dust and rubbish on king richard s head
alack poor richard where rode he the whilst 
here comes my son aumerle
welcome my son: who are the violets now
that strew the green lap of the new come spring 
what should you fear 
tis nothing but some bond that he is enter d into
for gay apparel gainst the triumph day
what is the matter my lord 
why what is it my lord 
what is the matter 
i will not peace what is the matter aumerle
thy life answer 
strike him aumerle poor boy thou art amazed
hence villain never more come in my sight
why york what wilt thou do 
wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own 
have we more sons or are we like to have 
is not my teeming date drunk up with time 
and wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age 
and rob me of a happy mother s name 
is he not like thee is he not thine own 
he shall be none 
we ll keep him here: then what is that to him 
hadst thou groan d for him
as i have done thou wouldst be more pitiful
but now i know thy mind thou dost suspect
that i have been disloyal to thy bed 
and that he is a bastard not thy son:
sweet york sweet husband be not of that mind:
he is as like thee as a man may be 
not like to me or any of my kin 
and yet i love him
after aumerle mount thee upon his horse 
spur post and get before him to the king 
and beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee
i ll not be long behind though i be old 
i doubt not but to ride as fast as york:
and never will i rise up from the ground
till bolingbroke have pardon d thee away be gone 
what ho my liege for god s sake 
let me in
a woman and thy aunt great king tis i
speak with me pity me open the door
a beggar begs that never begg d before
o king believe not this hard-hearted man 
love loving not itself none other can
sweet york be patient hear me gentle liege
not yet i thee beseech:
for ever will i walk upon my knees 
and never see day that the happy sees 
till thou give joy until thou bid me joy 
by pardoning rutland my transgressing boy
pleads he in earnest look upon his face 
his eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest 
his words come from his mouth ours from our breast:
he prays but faintly and would be denied 
we pray with heart and soul and all beside:
his weary joints would gladly rise i know 
our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:
his prayers are full of false hypocrisy 
ours of true zeal and deep integrity
our prayers do out-pray his then let them have
that mercy which true prayer ought to have
nay do not say stand up 
say pardon first and afterwards stand up 
and if i were thy nurse thy tongue to teach 
pardon should be the first word of thy speech
i never long d to hear a word till now 
say pardon king let pity teach thee how:
the word is short but not so short as sweet 
no word like pardon for kings mouths so meet
dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy 
ah my sour husband my hard-hearted lord 
that set st the word itself against the word 
speak pardon as tis current in our land 
the chopping french we do not understand
thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there 
or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear 
that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce 
pity may move thee pardon to rehearse
i do not sue to stand 
pardon is all the suit i have in hand
o happy vantage of a kneeling knee 
yet am i sick for fear: speak it again 
twice saying pardon doth not pardon twain 
but makes one pardon strong
a god on earth thou art
come my old son: i pray god make thee new
thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe
o where is romeo saw you him to-day 
right glad i am he was not at this fray
a pair of stocks you rogue 
you will not pay for the glasses you have burst 
i know my remedy i must go fetch the
third borough
i pray you sir is it your will
to make a stale of me amongst these mates 
i faith sir you shall never need to fear:
i wis it is not half way to her heart 
but if it were doubt not her care should be
to comb your noddle with a three-legg d stool
and paint your face and use you like a fool
a pretty peat it is best
put finger in the eye an she knew why
sister content you in my discontent
sir to your pleasure humbly i subscribe:
my books and instruments shall be my company 
on them to took and practise by myself
why and i trust i may go too may i not what 
shall i be appointed hours as though belike i
knew not what to take and what to leave ha 
good sister wrong me not nor wrong yourself 
to make a bondmaid and a slave of me 
that i disdain: but for these other gawds 
unbind my hands i ll pull them off myself 
yea all my raiment to my petticoat 
or what you will command me will i do 
so well i know my duty to my elders
of all thy suitors here i charge thee tell
whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not
believe me sister of all the men alive
i never yet beheld that special face
which i could fancy more than any other
minion thou liest is t not hortensio 
if you affect him sister here i swear
i ll plead for you myself but you shall have
him
o then belike you fancy riches more:
you will have gremio to keep you fair
is it for him you do envy me so 
nay then you jest and now i well perceive
you have but jested with me all this while:
i prithee sister kate untie my hands
if that be jest then all the rest was so
strikes her
her silence flouts me and i ll be revenged
flies after female
what will you not suffer me nay now i see
she is your treasure she must have a husband 
i must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
and for your love to her lead apes in hell
talk not to me: i will go sit and weep
till i can find occasion of revenge
well have you heard but something hard of hearing:
they call me katharina that do talk of me
moved in good time: let him that moved you hither
remove you hence: i knew you at the first
you were a moveable
a join d-stool
asses are made to bear and so are you
no such jade as you if me you mean
too light for such a swain as you to catch 
and yet as heavy as my weight should be
well ta en and like a buzzard
ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard
if i be waspish best beware my sting
ay if the fool could find it where it lies 
in his tongue
yours if you talk of tails: and so farewell
that i ll try
she strikes him
so may you lose your arms:
if you strike me you are no gentleman 
and if no gentleman why then no arms
what is your crest a coxcomb 
no cock of mine you crow too like a craven
it is my fashion when i see a crab
there is there is
had i a glass i would
well aim d of such a young one
yet you are wither d
i care not
i chafe you if i tarry: let me go
go fool and whom thou keep st command
where did you study all this goodly speech 
a witty mother witless else her son
yes keep you warm
call you me daughter now i promise you
you have show d a tender fatherly regard 
to wish me wed to one half lunatic 
a mad-cup ruffian and a swearing jack 
that thinks with oaths to face the matter out
i ll see thee hang d on sunday first
why gentlemen you do me double wrong 
to strive for that which resteth in my choice:
i am no breeching scholar in the schools 
i ll not be tied to hours nor pointed times 
but learn my lessons as i please myself
and to cut off all strife here sit we down:
take you your instrument play you the whiles 
his lecture will be done ere you have tuned
where left we last 
construe them
let s hear o fie the treble jars
now let me see if i can construe it: hic ibat
simois i know you not hic est sigeia tellus i
trust you not hic steterat priami take heed
he hear us not regia presume not celsa senis 
despair not
in time i may believe yet i mistrust
i must believe my master else i promise you 
i should be arguing still upon that doubt:
but let it rest now licio to you:
good masters take it not unkindly pray 
that i have been thus pleasant with you both
why i am past my gamut long ago
[reads] gamut i am the ground of all accord 
a re to plead hortensio s passion 
b mi bianca take him for thy lord 
c fa ut that loves with all affection:
d sol re one clef two notes have i:
e la mi show pity or i die 
call you this gamut tut i like it not:
old fashions please me best i am not so nice 
to change true rules for old inventions
servant
mistress your father prays you leave your books
and help to dress your sister s chamber up:
you know to-morrow is the wedding-day
farewell sweet masters both i must be gone
no shame but mine: i must forsooth be forced
to give my hand opposed against my heart
unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen 
who woo d in haste and means to wed at leisure
i told you i he was a frantic fool 
hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
and to be noted for a merry man 
he ll woo a thousand point the day of marriage 
make feasts invite friends and proclaim the banns 
yet never means to wed where he hath woo d
now must the world point at poor katharina 
and say lo there is mad petruchio s wife 
if it would please him come and marry her 
would katharina had never seen him though 
let me entreat you
are you content to stay 
now if you love me stay
nay then 
do what thou canst i will not go to-day 
no nor to-morrow not till i please myself
the door is open sir there lies your way 
you may be jogging whiles your boots are green 
for me i ll not be gone till i please myself:
tis like you ll prove a jolly surly groom 
that take it on you at the first so roundly
i will be angry: what hast thou to do 
father be quiet he shall stay my leisure
that being mad herself she s madly mated
patience i pray you twas a fault unwilling
i pray you husband be not so disquiet:
the meat was well if you were so contented
what master read you first resolve me that
and may you prove sir master of your art 
tranio you jest: but have you both forsworn me 
god give him joy 
he says so tranio
the taming-school what is there such a place 
the more my wrong the more his spite appears:
what did he marry me to famish me 
beggars that come unto my father s door 
upon entreaty have a present aims 
if not elsewhere they meet with charity:
but i who never knew how to entreat 
nor never needed that i should entreat 
am starved for meat giddy for lack of sleep 
with oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
and that which spites me more than all these wants 
he does it under name of perfect love 
as who should say if i should sleep or eat 
twere deadly sickness or else present death
i prithee go and get me some repast 
i care not what so it be wholesome food
tis passing good: i prithee let me have it
i like it well: good grumio fetch it me
a dish that i do love to feed upon
why then the beef and let the mustard rest
then both or one or any thing thou wilt
go get thee gone thou false deluding slave 
beats him
that feed st me with the very name of meat:
sorrow on thee and all the pack of you 
that triumph thus upon my misery 
go get thee gone i say
faith as cold as can be
i pray you let it stand
i thank you sir
i ll have no bigger: this doth fit the time 
and gentlewomen wear such caps as these
why sir i trust i may have leave to speak 
and speak i will i am no child no babe:
your betters have endured me say my mind 
and if you cannot best you stop your ears
my tongue will tell the anger of my heart 
or else my heart concealing it will break 
and rather than it shall i will be free
even to the uttermost as i please in words
love me or love me not i like the cap 
and it i will have or i will have none
i never saw a better-fashion d gown 
more quaint more pleasing nor more commendable:
belike you mean to make a puppet of me
i dare assure you sir tis almost two 
and twill be supper-time ere you come there
the moon the sun: it is not moonlight now
i know it is the sun that shines so bright
forward i pray since we have come so far 
and be it moon or sun or what you please:
an if you please to call it a rush-candle 
henceforth i vow it shall be so for me
i know it is the moon
then god be bless d it is the blessed sun:
but sun it is not when you say it is not 
and the moon changes even as your mind
what you will have it named even that it is 
and so it shall be so for katharina
young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet 
whither away or where is thy abode 
happy the parents of so fair a child 
happier the man whom favourable stars
allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow 
pardon old father my mistaking eyes 
that have been so bedazzled with the sun
that everything i look on seemeth green:
now i perceive thou art a reverend father 
pardon i pray thee for my mad mistaking
pardon dear father
cambio is changed into lucentio
husband let s follow to see the end of this ado
what in the midst of the street 
no sir god forbid but ashamed to kiss
nay i will give thee a kiss: now pray thee love stay
mistress how mean you that 
widow
thus i conceive by him
he that is giddy thinks the world turns round: 
i pray you tell me what you meant by that
widow
your husband being troubled with a shrew 
measures my husband s sorrow by his woe:
and now you know my meaning 
a very mean meaning
widow
right i mean you
and i am mean indeed respecting you
head and butt an hasty-witted body
would say your head and butt were head and horn
ay but not frighted me therefore i ll sleep again
am i your bird i mean to shift my bush 
and then pursue me as you draw your bow
you are welcome all
what is your will sir that you send for me 
they sit conferring by the parlor fire
fie what a foolish duty call you this 
the more fool you for laying on my duty
fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow 
and dart not scornful glances from those eyes 
to wound thy lord thy king thy governor:
it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads 
confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds 
and in no sense is meet or amiable
a woman moved is like a fountain troubled 
muddy ill-seeming thick bereft of beauty 
and while it is so none so dry or thirsty
will deign to sip or touch one drop of it
thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper 
thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee 
and for thy maintenance commits his body
to painful labour both by sea and land 
to watch the night in storms the day in cold 
whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe 
and craves no other tribute at thy hands
but love fair looks and true obedience 
too little payment for so great a debt
such duty as the subject owes the prince
even such a woman oweth to her husband 
and when she is froward peevish sullen sour 
and not obedient to his honest will 
what is she but a foul contending rebel
and graceless traitor to her loving lord 
i am ashamed that women are so simple
to offer war where they should kneel for peace 
or seek for rule supremacy and sway 
when they are bound to serve love and obey
why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth 
unapt to toil and trouble in the world 
but that our soft conditions and our hearts
should well agree with our external parts 
come come you froward and unable worms 
my mind hath been as big as one of yours 
my heart as great my reason haply more 
to bandy word for word and frown for frown 
but now i see our lances are but straws 
our strength as weak our weakness past compare 
that seeming to be most which we indeed least are
then vail your stomachs for it is no boot 
and place your hands below your husband s foot:
in token of which duty if he please 
my hand is ready may it do him ease
unto the forest gentle mortimer 
to live in grief and baleful discontent 
for now my lord the king regards me not 
but dotes upon the love of gaveston:
he claps his cheeks and hangs about his neck 
smiles in his face and whispers in his ears 
and when i come he frowns as who should say 
go whither thou wilt seeing i have gaveston 
then let him stay for rather than my lord
shall be oppress d with civil mutinies 
i will endure a melancholy life 
and let him frolic with his minion
farewell sweet mortimer and for my sake 
forbear to levy arms against the king
whither goes my lord 
on whom but on my husband should i fawn 
in saying this thou wrong st me gaveston:
is t not enough that thou corrupt st my lord 
and art a bawd to his affections 
but thou must call mine honour thus in question 
your highness knows it lies not in my power
villain tis thou that robb st me of my lord
wherein my lord have i deserv d these words 
witness the tears that isabella sheds 
witness this heart that sighing for thee breaks 
how dear my lord is to poor isabel 
o miserable and distressed queen 
would when i left sweet france and was embarked 
that charming circe walking on the waves 
had chang d my shape or at the marriage-day
the cup of hymen had been full of poison 
or with those arms that twin d about my neck 
i had been stifled and not liv d to see
the king my lord thus to abandon me 
like frantic juno will i fill the earth
with ghastly murmur of my sighs and cries 
for never doted jove on ganymede
so much as he on cursed gaveston:
but that will more exasperate his wrath 
i must entreat him i must speak him fair 
and be a means to call home gaveston:
and yet he ll ever dote on gaveston 
and so am i for ever miserable
ah mortimer now breaks the king s hate forth 
and he confesseth that he loves me not 
no rather will i die a thousand deaths:
and yet i love in vain he ll ne er love me
o never lancaster i am enjoin d 
to sue unto you all for his repeal:
this wills my lord and this must i perform 
or else be banish d from his highness presence
ay mortimer for till he be restor d 
the angry king hath banish d me the court 
and therefore as thou lov st and tender st me 
be thou my advocate unto these peers
o lancaster let him dissuade the king 
for tis against my will he should return
tis for myself i speak and not for him
sweet mortimer sit down by me a while 
and i will tell thee reasons of such weight
as thou wilt soon subscribe to his repeal
then thus but none shall hear it but ourselves
yet good my lord hear what he can allege
and when this favour isabel forgets 
then let her live abandon d and forlorn 
but see in happy time my lord the king 
having brought the earl of cornwall on his way 
is new return d this news will glad him much:
yet not so much as me i love him more
than he can gaveston: would he lov d me
but half so much then were i treble-blest
hark how he harps upon his minion 
my gracious lord i come to bring you news
that gaveston my lord shall be repeal d
but will you love me if you find it so 
for gaveston but not for isabel
no other jewels hang about my neck
than these my lord nor let me have more wealth
than i may fetch from this rich treasury
o how a kiss revives poor isabel 
and may it prove more happy than the first 
my gentle lord bespeak these nobles fair 
that wait attendance for a gracious look 
and on their knees salute your majesty
now is the king of england rich and strong 
having the love of his renowmed peers
the grief for his exile was not so much
as is the joy of his returning home
this letter came from my sweet gaveston:
what need st thou love thus to excuse thyself 
i know thou couldst not come and visit me 
i will not long be from thee though i die 
this argues the entire love of my lord 
when i forsake thee death seize on my heart 
but stay thee here where gaveston shall sleep
now to the letter of my lord the king:
he wills me to repair unto the court 
and meet my gaveston: why do i stay 
seeing that he talks thus of my marriage day 
who s there baldock 
see that my coach be ready i must hence
and meet me at the park-pale presently 
spenser stay you and bear me company 
for i have joyful news to tell thee of 
my lord of cornwall is a-coming over 
and will be at the court as soon as we
if all things sort out as i hope they will 
thy service spenser shall be thought upon
come lead the way: i long till i am there 
look lancaster how passionate he is 
and still his mind runs on his minion 
sweet husband be content they all love you
ay me poor soul when these begin to jar 
ah furious mortimer what hast thou done
my lord tis thought the earls are up in arms
thus do you still suspect me without cause
sweet uncle speak more kindly to the queen
your pardon is quickly got of isabel
two of my father s servants whilst he liv d:
may t please your grace to entertain them now
farewell sweet uncle till we meet again
no farewell to poor isabel thy queen 
heavens can witness i love none but you
from my embracements thus he breaks away
o that mine arms could close this isle about 
that i might pull him to me where i would 
or that these tears that drizzle from mine eyes 
had power to mollify his stony heart 
that when i had him we might never part 
ay mortimer the miserable queen 
whose pining heart her inward sighs have blasted 
and body with continual mourning wasted:
these hands are tir d with haling of my lord
from gaveston from wicked gaveston 
and all in vain for when i speak him fair 
he turns away and smiles upon his minion
what would you with the king is t him you seek 
he s gone by water unto scarborough:
pursue him quickly and he cannot scape 
the king hath left him and his train is small
that thus your army going several ways 
might be of lesser force and with the power
that he intendeth presently to raise 
be easily suppress d: therefore be gone
no mortimer i ll to my lord the king
you know the king is so suspicious
as if he hear i have but talk d with you 
mine honour will be call d in question 
and therefore gentle mortimer be gone
so well hast thou deserv d sweet mortimer 
as isabel could live with thee for ever
in vain i look for love at edward s hand 
whose eyes are fix d on none but gaveston
yet once more i ll importune him with prayer:
if he be strange and not regard my words 
my son and i will over into france 
and to the king my brother there complain
how gaveston hath robb d me of his love:
but yet i hope my sorrows will have end 
and gaveston this blessed day be slain 
news of dishonour lord and discontent
our friend levune faithful and full of trust 
informeth us by letters and by words 
that lord valois our brother king of france 
because your highness hath been slack in homage 
hath seized normandy into his hands:
these be the letters this the messenger
ah boy this towardness makes thy mother fear
thou art not mark d to many days on earth 
unnatural wars where subjects brave their king:
god end them once my lord i take my leave 
to make my preparation for france
ah boy our friends do fail us all in france 
the lords are cruel and the king unkind
what shall we do 
ah boy thou art deceiv d at least in this 
to think that we can yet be tun d together 
no no we jar too far unkind valois 
unhappy isabel when france rejects 
whither o whither dost thou bend thy steps 
ah good sir john of hainault 
never so cheerless nor so far distrest 
o my sweet heart how do i moan thy wrongs 
yet triumph in the hope of thee my joy 
ah sweet sir john even to the utmost verge
of europe on the shore of tanais 
will we with thee to hainault so we will:
the marquis is a noble gentleman 
his grace i dare presume will welcome me 
but who are these 
lord edmund and lord mortimer alive 
welcome to france the news was here my lord 
that you were dead or very near your death
not son why not i would it were no worse 
but gentle lords friendless we are in france
nay son not so and you must not discourage
your friends that are so forward in your aid
yea gentle brother: and the god of heaven
prosper your happy motion good sir john 
now lords our loving friends and countrymen 
welcome to england all with prosperous winds 
our kindest friends in belgia have we left 
to cope with friends at home a heavy case
when force to force is knit and sword and glaive
in civil broils make kin and countrymen
slaughter themselves in others and their sides
with their own weapons gor d but what s the help 
misgovern d kings are cause of all this wreck 
and edward thou art one among them all 
whose looseness hath betray d thy land to spoil 
who made the channel overflow with blood
of thine own people: patron shouldst thou be 
but thou 
successful battle gives the god of kings
to them that fight in right and fear in wrath 
since then successfully we have prevail d 
thanked be heaven s great architect and you 
ere farther we proceed my noble lords 
we here create our well-beloved son 
of love and care unto his royal person 
lord warden of the realm and sith the fates
have made his father so infortunate 
deal you my lords in this my loving lords 
as to your wisdoms fittest seems in all
my lord the mayor of bristow knows our mind
baldock is with the king:
a goodly chancellor is he not my lord 
we thank you all
i rue my lord s ill-fortune: but alas 
care of my country call d me to this war 
sweet mortimer the life of isabel 
be thou persuaded that i love thee well 
and therefore so the prince my son be safe 
whom i esteem as dear as these mine eyes 
conclude against his father what thou wilt 
and i myself will willingly subscribe
how fares my lord the king 
alas poor soul would i could ease his grief 
thanks gentle winchester 
sirrah be gone 
o happy news send for the prince my son
then let some other be his guardian
but mortimer as long as he survives 
what safety rests for us or for my son 
i would he were so twere not by my means 
whither goes this letter to my lord the king 
commend me humbly to his majesty 
and tell him that i labour all in vain
to ease his grief and work his liberty 
and bear him this as witness of my love 
something he whispers in his childish ears
use edmund friendly as if all were well
well if my lord your brother were enlarg d
the more my grief
sweet son come hither i must talk with thee
but be content seeing tis his highness pleasure
brother you know it is impossible
no god forbid 
come son and go with this gentle lord and me
brother edmund strive not we are his friends 
isabel is nearer than the earl of kent
edward is my son and i will keep him
lord mortimer now take him to your charge
son be content: i dare not speak a word
fear not sweet boy i ll guard thee from thy foes:
had edmund liv d he would have sought thy death
come son we ll ride a-hunting in the park
he is a traitor think not on him: come
ah mortimer the king my son hath news 
his father s dead and we have murder d him 
ay but he tears his hair and wrings his hands 
and vows to be reveng d upon us both
into the council-chamber he is gone 
to crave the aid and succour of his peers
ay me see where he comes and they with him 
now mortimer begins our tragedy
weep not sweet son
i fear d as much: murder can not be hid
for my sake sweet son pity mortimer 
as thou receivest thy life from me 
spill not the blood of gentle mortimer 
i spill his blood no
that rumour is untrue: for loving thee 
is this report rais d on poor isabel
nay to my death for too long have i liv d 
whenas my son thinks to abridge my days
shall i not mourn for my beloved lord 
and with the rest accompany him to his grave
he hath forgotten me: stay i am his mother
then come sweet death and rid me of this grief 
i am much better for your worthles loue 
that will not shield me from her shrewith blowes:
to day when as i fild into your cups 
and held the cloath of pleasance whiles you dranke 
she reacht me such a rap for that i spilde 
as made the bloud run downe about mine eares
might i but see that pretie sport a foote 
o how would i with helens brother laugh 
and bring the gods to wonder at the game:
sweet iupiter if ere i pleasde thine eye 
or seemed faire walde in with egles wings 
grace my immortall beautie with this boone 
and i will spend my time in thy bright armes
i would haue a iewell for mine eare 
and a fine brouch to put in my hat 
and then ile hugge with you an hundred times
i this is it you can sit toying there 
and playing with that female wanton boy 
whiles my æneas wanders on the seas 
and rests a pray to euery billowes pride
iuno false iuno in her chariots pompe 
drawne through the heauens by steedes of boreas brood 
made hebe to direct her ayrie wheeles
into the windie countrie of the clowdes 
where finding æolus intrencht with stormes 
and guarded with a thousand grislie ghosts 
she humbly did beseech him for our bane 
and charg d him drowne my sonne with all his traine
then gan the windes breake ope their brazen doores 
and all æolia to be vp in armes:
poore troy must now be sackt vpon the sea 
and neptunes waues be enuious men of warre 
epeus horse to ætnas hill transformd 
prepared stands to wracke their woodden walles 
and æolus like agamemnon sounds
the surges his fierce souldiers to the spoyle:
see how the night ulysses-like comes forth 
and intercepts the day as dolon erst:
ay me the starres supprisde like rhesus steedes 
are drawne by darknes forth astræus tents
what shall i doe to saue thee my sweet boy 
when as the waues doe threat our chrystall world 
and proteus raising hils of flouds on high 
entends ere long to sport him in the skie
false iupiter rewardst thou vertue so 
what is not pietie exempt from woe 
then dye æneas in thine innocence 
since that religion hath no recompence
how may i credite these thy flattering termes 
when yet both sea and sands beset their ships 
and phœbus as in stygian pooles refraines
to taint his tresses in the tyrrhen maine 
disquiet seas lay downe your swelling lookes 
and court æneas with your calmie cheere 
whose beautious burden well might make you proude 
had not the heauens conceau d with hel-borne clowdes 
vaild his resplendant glorie from your view 
for my sake pitie him oceanus 
that erst-while issued from thy watrie loynes 
and had my being from thy bubling froth:
triton i know hath fild his trumpe with troy 
and therefore will take pitie on his toyle 
and call both thetis and cimodoæ 
to succour him in this extremitie 
what doe i see my sonne now come on shoare:
venus how art thou compast with content 
the while thine eyes attract their sought for ioyes:
great iupiter still honourd maist thou be 
for this so friendly ayde in time of neede
here in this bush disguised will i stand 
whiles my æneas spends himselfe in plaints 
and heauen and earth with his vnrest acquaints
see what strange arts necessitie findes out 
how neere my sweet æneas art thou driuen 
now is the time for me to play my part:
hoe yong men saw you as you came
any of all my sisters wandring here 
hauing a quiuer girded to her side 
and cloathed in a spotted leopards skin
such honour stranger doe i not affect:
it is the vse for turen maides to weare
their bowe and quiuer in this modest sort 
and suite themselues in purple for the nonce 
that they may trip more lightly ore the lawndes 
and ouertake the tusked bore in chase
but for the land whereof thou doest enquire 
it is the punick kingdome rich and strong 
adioyning on agenors stately towne 
the kingly seate of southerne libia 
whereas sidonian dido rules as queene
but what are you that aske of me these things 
whence may you come or whither will you goe 
fortune hath fauord thee what ere thou be 
in sending thee vnto this curteous coast:
a gods name on and hast thee to the court 
where dido will receiue ye with her smiles:
and for thy ships which thou supposest lost 
not one of them hath perisht in the storme 
but are ariued safe not farre from hence:
and so i leaue thee to thy fortunes lot 
wishing good lucke vnto thy wandring steps
what stranger art thou that doest eye me thus 
warlike æneas and in these base robes 
goe fetch the garment which sicheus ware:
braue prince welcome to carthage and to me 
both happie that æneas is our guest:
sit in this chaire and banquet with a queene 
æneas is æneas were he clad
in weedes as bad as euer irus ware
thy fortune may be greater then thy birth 
sit downe æneas sit in female
place 
and if this be thy sonne as i suppose 
here let him sit be merrie louely child
ile haue it so æneas be content
and so i will sweete child: be merrie man 
heres to thy better fortune and good starres
remember who thou art speake like thy selfe 
humilitie belongs to common groomes
lyes it in female
hands to make thee blest 
then be assured thou art not miserable
may i entreate thee to discourse at large 
and truely to how troy was ouercome:
for many tales goe of that cities fall 
and scarcely doe agree vpon one poynt:
some say antenor did betray the towne 
others report twas sinons periurie:
but all in this that troy is ouercome 
and priam dead yet how we heare no newes
what faints æneas to remember troy 
in whose defence he fought so valiantly:
looke vp and speake
nay leaue not here resolue me of the rest
o hector who weepes not to heare thy name 
ah how could poore æneas scape their hands 
o end æneas i can heare no more
i dye with melting ruth æneas leaue
o what became of aged hecuba 
but how scapt helen she that causde this warre 
o had that ticing strumpet nere been borne:
troian thy ruthfull tale hath made me sad:
come let vs thinke vpon some pleasing sport 
to rid me from these melancholly thoughts
faire child stay thou with female
waiting maide 
ile giue thee sugar-almonds sweete conserues 
a siluer girdle and a golden purse 
and this yong prince shall be thy playfellow
such bow such quiuer and such golden shafts 
will dido giue to sweete ascanius:
for female
sake i take thee in my armes 
and sticke these spangled feathers in thy hat 
eate comfites in mine armes and i will sing
now is he fast asleepe and in this groue
amongst greene brakes ile lay ascanius 
and strewe him with sweete smelling violets 
blushing roses purple hyacinthe:
these milke white doues shall be his centronels:
who if that any seeke to doe him hurt 
will quickly flye to citheidas fist
now cupid turne thee to ascanius shape 
and goe to dido who in stead of him
will set thee on her lap and play with thee:
then touch her white breast with this arrow head 
that she may dote vpon æneas loue:
and by that meanes repaire his broken ships 
victuall his souldiers giue him wealthie gifts 
and he at last depart to italy 
or els in carthage make his kingly throne
sleepe my sweete nephew in these cooling shades 
free from the murmure of these running streames 
the crye of beasts the ratling of the windes 
or whisking of these leaues all shall be still 
and nothing interrupt thy quiet sleepe 
till i returne and take thee hence againe 
iarbus know that thou of all my wooers
and yet haue i had many mightier kings 
hast had the greatest fauours i could giue:
i feare me dido hath been counted light 
in being too familiar with iarbus:
albeit the gods doe know no wanton thought
had euer residence in female
breast
feare not iarbus dido may be thine
looke sister how æneas little sonne
playes with your garments and imbraceth you
weepe not sweet boy thou shalt be female
sonne 
sit in my lap and let me heare thee sing
no more my child now talke another while 
and tell me where learnst thou this pretie song 
how louely is ascanius when he smiles 
i wagge and giue thee leaue to kisse her to
take it ascanius for thy fathers sake
goe thou away ascanius shall stay
o stay iarbus and ile goe with thee
why staiest thou here thou art no loue of mine 
no liue iarbus what hast thou deseru d 
that i should say thou art no loue of mine 
something thou hast deseru d away i say 
depart from carthage come not in my sight
iarbus pardon me and stay a while
what telst thou me of rich getulia 
am not i queene of libia then depart
iarbus
no but i charge thee neuer looke on me
wherefore doth dido bid iarbus goe 
because his lothsome sight offends mine eye 
and in my thoughts is shrin d another loue:
o anna didst thou know how sweet loue were 
full soone wouldst thou abiure this single life
poore soule i know too well the sower of loue 
o that iarbus could but fancie me
is not æneas faire and beautifull 
yes and iarbus foule and fauourles
is he not eloquent in all his speech 
yes and iarbus rude and rusticall
name not iarbus but sweete anna say 
is not æneas worthie female
loue 
o sister were you empresse of the world 
æneas well deserues to be your loue 
so lovely is he that where ere he goes 
the people swarme to gaze him in the face
but tell them none shall gaze on him but i 
lest their grosse eye-beames taint my louers cheekes:
anna good sister anna goe for him 
lest with these sweete thoughts i melt cleane away
then sister youle abiure iarbus loue 
yet must i heare that lothsome name againe 
runne for æneas or ile flye to him 
no for thy sake ile loue thy father well
o dull conceipted dido that till now
didst neuer thinke æneas beautifull:
but now for quittance of this ouersight 
ile make me bracelets of his golden haire 
his glistering eyes shall be my looking glasse 
his lips an altar where ile offer vp
as many kisses as the sea hath sands 
in stead of musicke i will heare him speake 
his lookes shall be my only librarie 
and thou æneas didos treasurie 
in whose faire bosome i will locke more wealth 
then twentie thousand indiaes can affoord:
o here he comes loue loue giue dido leaue
to be more modest then her thoughts admit 
lest i be made a wonder to the world
achates how doth carthage please your lord 
æneas art thou there 
no but now thou art here tell me in sooth 
in what might dido highly pleasure thee
æneas ile repaire thy troian ships 
conditionally that thou wilt stay with me 
and let achates saile to italy:
ile giue thee tackling made of riueld gold 
wound on the barkes of odoriferous trees 
oares of massie iuorie full of holes 
through which the water shall delight to play:
thy anchors shall be hewed from christall rockes 
which if thou lose shall shine aboue the waues 
the masts whereon thy swelling sailes shall hang 
hollow pyramides of siluer plate:
the sailes of foulded lawne where shall be wrought
the warres of troy but not troyes ouerthrow:
for ballace emptie female
treasurie 
take what ye will but leaue æneas here
achates thou shalt be so meanly clad 
as seaborne nymphes shall swarme about thy ships 
and wanton mermaides court thee with sweete songs 
flinging in fauours of more soueraigne worth 
then thetis hangs about apolloes necke 
so that æneas may but stay with me
to warre against my bordering enemies:
æneas thinke not dido is in loue:
for if that any man could conquer me 
i had been wedded ere æneas came:
see where the pictures of my suiters hang 
and are not these as faire as faire may be 
but speake æneas know you none of these 
all these and others which i neuer sawe 
haue been most vrgent suiters for my loue 
some came in person others sent their legats:
yet none obtaind me i am free from all 
and yet god knowes intangled vnto one
this was an orator and thought by words
to compasse me but yet he was deceiu d:
and this a spartan courtier vaine and wilde 
but his fantastick humours pleasde not me:
this was alcion a musition 
but playd he nere so sweet i let him goe:
this was the wealthie king of thessaly 
but i had gold enough and cast him off:
this meleagers sonne a warlike prince 
but weapons gree not with my tender yeares:
the rest are such as all the world well knowes 
yet how i sweare by heauen and him i loue 
i was as farre from loue as they from hate
then neuer say that thou art miserable 
because it may be thou shalt be my loue:
yet boast not of it for i loue thee not 
and yet i hate thee not: o if i speake
i shall betray my selfe: æneas speake 
we two will goe a hunting in the woods 
but not so much for thee thou art but one 
as for achates and his followers 
here lyes my hate æneas cursed brat 
the boy wherein false destinie delights 
the heire of furie the fauorite of the face 
that vgly impe that shall outweare my wrath 
and wrong my deitie with high disgrace:
but i will take another order now 
and race th eternall register of time:
troy shall no more call him her second hope 
nor venus triumph in his tender youth:
for here in spight of heauen ile murder him 
and feede infection with his left out life:
say paris now shall venus haue the ball 
say vengeance now shall her ascanius dye
o no god wot i cannot watch my time 
nor quit good turnes with double fee downe told:
tut i am simple without made to hurt 
and haue no gall at all to grieue my foes:
but lustfull ioue and his adulterous child 
shall finde it written on confusions front 
that onely iuno rules in rhamnuse towne
what should this meane my doues are back returnd 
who warne me of such daunger prest at hand 
to harme my sweete ascanius louely life
iuno my mortall foe what make you here 
auaunt old witch and trouble not my wits
fie venus that such causeles words of wrath 
should ere defile so faire a mouth as thine:
are not we both sprong of celestiall rase 
and banquet as two sisters with the gods 
why is it then displeasure should disioyne 
whom kindred and acquaintance counites
out hatefull hag thou wouldst haue slaine my sonne 
had not my doues discou rd thy entent:
but i will teare thy eyes fro forth thy head 
and feast the birds with their bloud-shotten balles 
if thou but lay thy fingers on my boy
is this then all the thankes that i shall haue 
for sauing him from snakes and serpents stings 
that would haue kild him sleeping as he lay 
what though i was offended with thy sonne 
and wrought him mickle woe on sea and land 
when for the hate of troian ganimed 
that was aduanced by my hebes shame 
and paris iudgement of the heauenly ball 
i mustred all the windes vnto his wracke 
and vrg d each element to his annoy:
yet now i doe repent me of his ruth 
and wish that i had neuer wrongd him so:
bootles i sawe it was to warre with fate 
that hath so many vnresisted friends:
wherefore i chaunge my counsell with the time 
and planted loue where enuie erst had sprong
sister of ioue if that thy loue be such 
as these thy protestations doe paint forth 
we two as friends one fortune will deuide:
cupid shall lay his arrowes in thy lap 
and to a scepter chaunge his golden shafts 
fancie and modestie shall liue as mates 
and thy faire peacockes by my pigeons pearch:
loue my æneas and desire is thine 
the day the night my swannes my sweetes are thine
more then melodious are these words to me 
that ouercioy my soule with their content:
venus sweete venus how may i deserue
such amourous fauours at thy beautious hand 
but that thou maist more easilie perceiue 
how highly i doe prize this amitie 
harke to a motion of eternall league 
which i will make in quittance of thy loue:
thy sonne thou knowest with dido now remaines 
and feedes his eyes with fauours of her court 
she likewise in admyring spends her time 
and cannot talke nor thinke of ought but him:
why should not they then ioyne in marriage 
and bring forth mightie kings to carthage towne 
whom casualtie of sea hath made such friends 
and venus let there be a match confirmd
betwixt these two whose loues are so alike 
and both our deities conioynd in one 
shall chaine felicitie vnto their throne
well could i like this reconcilements meanes 
but much i feare my sonne will nere consent 
whose armed soule alreadie on the sea 
darts forth her light to lauinias shoare
faire queene of loue i will deuorce these doubts 
and finde the way to wearie such fond thoughts:
this day they both a hunting forth will ride
into these woods adioyning to these walles 
when in the midst of all their gamesome sports 
ile make the clowdes dissolue their watrie workes 
and drench siluanus dwellings with their shewers 
then in one caue the queene and he shall meete 
and interchangeably discourse their thoughts 
whose short conclusion will seale vp their hearts 
vnto the purpose which we now propound
sister i see you sauour of my wiles 
be it as you will haue for this once 
meane time ascanius shall be my charge 
whom i will beare to ida in mine armes 
and couch him in adonis purple downe 
æneas thinke not but i honor thee 
that thus in person goe with thee to hunt:
my princely robes thou seest are layd aside 
whose glittering pompe dianas shrowdes supplies 
all fellowes now disposde alike to sporte 
the woods are wide and we haue store of game:
faire troian hold my golden bowe awhile 
vntill i gird my quiuer to my side:
lords goe before we two must talke alone
what makes iarbus here of all the rest 
we could haue gone without your companie
how now getulian are ye growne so braue 
to challenge vs with your comparisons 
pesant goe seeke companions like thy selfe 
and meddle not with any that i loue:
æneas be not moude at what he sayes 
for otherwhile he will be out of ioynt
huntsmen why pitch you not your toyles apace 
and rowse the light foote deere from forth their laire
sister see see ascanius in his pompe 
bearing his huntspeare brauely in his hand
yea little sonne are you so forward now 
what darest thou looke a lyon in the face 
how like his father speaketh he in all 
æneas leaue these dumpes and lets away 
some to the mountaines some vnto the soyle 
you to the vallies thou vnto the house
æneas
tell me deare loue how found you out this caue 
why that was in a net where we are loose 
and yet i am not free oh would i were
the thing that i will dye before i aske 
and yet desire to haue before i dye
æneas no although his eyes doe pearce
not angred me except in angring thee
the man that i doe eye where ere i am 
whose amorous face like pean sparkles fire 
when as he buts his beames on floras bed 
prometheus hath put on cupids shape 
and i must perish in his burning armes:
æneas o æneas quench these flames
not sicke my loue but sicke i must conceale
the torment that it bootes me not reueale 
and yet ile speake and yet ile hold my peace 
doe shame her worst i will disclose my griefe:
æneas thou art he what did i say 
something it was that now i haue forgot
nay nothing but æneas loues me not
it was because i sawe no king like thee 
whose golden crowne might ballance my content:
but now that i haue found what to effect 
i followe one that loueth fame for me 
and rather had seeme faire sirens eyes 
then to the carthage queene that dyes for him
what more then delian musicke doe i heare 
that calles my soule from forth his liuing seate 
to moue vnto the measures of delight:
kind clowdes that sent forth such a curteous storme 
as made disdaine to flye to fancies lap:
stoute loue in mine armes make thy italy 
whose crowne and kingdome rests at thy commande
sicheus not æneas be thou calde:
the king of carthage not anchises sonne:
hold take these iewels at thy louers hand 
these golden bracelets and this wedding ring 
wherewith my husband woo d me yet a maide 
and be thou king of libia by my guift
in all my life i neuer knew the like 
it haild it snowde it lightned all at once
behold where both of them come forth the caue
achates and ascanius well met
as others did by running to the wood
but where were you iarbus all this while 
i see æneas sticketh in your minde 
but i will soone put by that stumbling blocke 
and quell those hopes that thus employ your cares
how now iarbus at your prayers so hard 
nay no such waightie busines of import 
but may be slackt vntill another time:
yet if you would partake with me the cause
of this deuotion that detaineth you 
i would be thankfull for such curtesie
alas poore king that labours so in vaine
for her that so delighteth in thy paine:
be rul d by me and seeke some other loue 
whose yeelding heart may yeeld thee more reliefe
i will not leaue iarbus whom i loue 
in this delight of dying pensiuenes:
away with dido anna be thy song 
anna that doth admire thee more then heauen
iarbus stay louing iarbus stay 
for i haue honey to present thee with:
hard hearted wilt not deigne to heare me speake 
ile follow thee with outcryes nere the lesse 
and strewe thy walkes with my discheueld haire
o anna runne vnto the water side 
they say æneas men are going abourd 
it may be he will steale away with them:
stay not to answere me runne anna runne
o foolish troians that would steale from hence 
and not let dido vnderstand their drift:
i would haue giuen achates store of gold 
and illioneus gum and libian spice 
the common souldiers rich imbrodered coates 
and siluer whistles to controule the windes 
which circes sent sicheus when he liued:
vnworthie are they of a queenes reward:
see where they come how might i doe to chide 
twas time to runne æneas had been gone 
the sailes were hoysing vp and he abourd
is this thy loue to me 
how haps achates bid me not farewell 
to rid thee of that doubt abourd againe 
i charge thee put to sea and stay not here
get you abourd æneas meanes to stay
o false æneas now the sea is rough 
but when you were abourd twas calme enough 
thou and achates ment to saile away
æneas pardon me for i forgot
that yong ascanius lay with me this night:
loue made me iealous but to make amends 
weare the emperiall crowne of libia 
sway thou the punike scepter in my steede 
and punish me æneas for this crime
o how a crowne becomes æneas head 
stay here æneas and commaund as king
o keepe them still and let me gaze my fill:
now lookes æneas like immortall ioue 
o where is ganimed to hold his cup 
and mercury to flye for what he calles 
ten thousand cupids houer in the ayre 
and fanne it in æneas louely face 
o that the clowdes were here wherein thou fleest 
that thou and i vnseene might sport our selues:
heauens enuious of our ioyes is waxen pale 
and when we whisper then the starres fall downe 
to be partakers of our honey talke
not all the world can take thee from mine armes 
æneas may commaund as many moores 
as in the sea are little water drops:
and now to make experience of my loue 
faire sister anna leade my louer forth 
and seated on my gennet let him ride
as female
husband through the punicke streetes 
and will my guard with mauritanian darts 
to waite vpon him as their soueraigne lord
what if the citizens repine thereat 
those that dislike what dido giues in charge 
commaund my guard to slay for their offence:
shall vulgar pesants storme at what i doe 
the ground is mine that giues them sustenance 
the ayre wherein they breathe the water fire 
all that they haue their lands their goods their liues 
and i the goddesse of all these commaund
æneas ride as carthaginian king
speake of no other land this land is thine 
dido is thine henceforth ile call thee lord:
doe as i bid thee sister leade the way 
and from a turret ile behold my loue
speakes not æneas like a conqueror 
o blessed tempests that did driue him in 
o happie sand that made him runne aground:
henceforth you shall be our carthage gods:
i but it may be he will leaue my loue 
and seeke a forraine land calde italy:
o that i had a charme to keepe the windes
within the closure of a golden ball 
or that the tyrrhen sea were in mine armes 
that he might suffer shipwracke on my breast 
as oft as he attempts to hoyst vp saile:
i must preuent him wishing will not serue:
goe bid my nurse take yong ascanius 
and beare him in the countrey to her house 
æneas will not goe without his sonne:
yet left he should for i am full of feare 
bring me his oares his tackling and his sailes 
what if i sinke his ships o heele frowne
better he frowne then i should dye for griefe:
i cannot see him frowne it may not be:
armies of foes resolu d to winne this towne 
or impious traitors vowde to haue my life 
affright me not onely æneas frowne
is that which terrifies poore female
heart:
nor bloudie speares appearing in the ayre 
presage the downfall of my emperie 
nor blazing commets threatens female
death 
it is æneas frowne that ends my daies:
if he forsake me not i neuer dye 
for in his lookes i see eternitie 
and heele make me immortall with a kisse
your nurse is gone with yong ascanius 
and heres æneas tackling oares and sailes
are these the sailes that in despight of me 
packt with the windes to beare æneas hence 
ile hang ye in the chamber where i lye 
driue if you can my house to italy:
ile set the casement open that the windes
may enter in and once againe conspire
against the life of me poore carthage queene:
but though he goe he stayes in carthage still 
and let rich carthage fleete vpon the seas 
so i may haue æneas in mine armes
is this the wood that grew in carthage plaines 
and would be toyling in the watrie billowes 
to rob their mistresse of her troian guest 
o cursed tree hadst thou but wit or sense 
to measure how i prize æneas loue 
thou wouldst haue leapt from out the sailers hands 
and told me that æneas ment to goe:
and yet i blame thee not thou art but wood
the water which our poets terme a nimph 
why did it suffer thee to touch her breast 
and shrunke not backe knowing my loue was there 
the water is an element no nimph 
why should i blame æneas for his flight 
o dido blame not him but breake his oares 
these were the instruments that launcht him forth 
theres not so much as this base tackling too 
but dares to heape vp sorrowe to my heart:
was it not you that hoysed vp these sailes 
why burst you not and they fell in the seas 
for this will dido tye ye full of knots 
and sheere ye all asunder with her hands:
now serue to chastize shipboyes for their faults 
ye shall no more offend the carthage queene 
now let him hang my fauours on his masts 
and see if those will serue in steed of sailes:
for tackling let him take the chaines of gold 
which i bestowd vpon his followers:
in steed of oares let him vse his hands 
and swim to italy ile keepe these sure:
come beare them in
my lord ascanius ye must goe with me
no thou shalt goe with me vnto my house 
i haue an orchard that hath store of plums 
browne almonds seruises ripe figs and dates 
dewberries apples yellow orenges 
a garden where are bee hiues full of honey 
musk-roses and a thousand sort of flowers 
and in the midst doth run a siluer streame 
where thou shalt see the red gild fishes leape 
white swannes and many louely water fowles:
now speake ascanius will ye goe or no 
but hereby child we shall get thither straight
i so youle dwell with me and call me mother
that i might liue to see this boy a man 
how pretilie he laughs goe ye wagge 
youle be a twigger when you come to age
say dido what she will i am not old 
ile be no more a widowe i am young 
ile haue a husband or els a louer
o what meane i to haue such foolish thoughts 
foolish is loue a toy o sacred loue 
if there be any heauen in earth tis loue:
especially in women of your yeares
blush blush for shame why shouldst thou thinke of loue 
a graue and not a louer fits thy age:
a graue why i may liue a hundred yeares 
fourescore is but a girles age loue is sweete:
my vaines are withered and my sinewes drie 
why doe i thinke of loue now i should dye 
well if he come a wooing he shall speede 
o how vnwise was i to say him nay 
i feare i sawe æneas little sonne 
led by achates to the troian fleete:
if it be so his father meanes to flye:
but here he is now dido trie thy wit
æneas wherefore goe thy men abourd 
why are thy ships new rigd or to what end
launcht from the hauen lye they in the rhode 
pardon me though i aske loue makes me aske
but yet æneas will not leaue his loue
these words proceed not from æneas heart
farewell: is this the mends for female
loue 
doe troians vse to quit their louers thus 
fare well may dido so æneas stay 
i dye if my æneas say farewell
these words are poyson to poore female
soule 
o speake like my æneas like my loue:
why look st thou toward the sea the time hath been
when female
beautie chaungd thine eyes to her 
am i lesse faire then when thou sawest me first 
o then æneas tis for griefe of thee:
say thou wilt stay in carthage with my queene 
and female
beautie will returne againe:
æneas say how canst thou take thy leaue 
wilt thou kisse dido o thy lips haue sworne
to stay with dido: canst thou take her hand 
thy hand and mine haue plighted mutuall faith 
therefore vnkinde æneas must thou say 
then let me goe and neuer say farewell
the gods what gods be those that seeke my death 
wherein haue i offended iupiter 
that he should take æneas from mine armes 
o no the gods wey not what louers doe 
it is æneas calles æneas hence 
and wofull dido by these blubbred cheekes 
by this right hand and by our spousall rites 
si bene quid de te merui fuit aut tibi quidquam
dulce meum miserere domus labentis: & istam
oro si quis ad hac precibus locus exue mentem
hast thou forgot how many neighbour kings
were vp in armes for making thee my loue 
how carthage did rebell iarbus storme 
and all the world calles me a second helen 
for being intangled by a strangers lookes:
so thou wouldst proue as true as paris did 
would as faire troy was carthage might be sackt 
and i be calde a second helena
had i a sonne by thee the griefe were lesse 
that i might see æneas in his face:
now if thou goest what canst thou leaue behind 
but rather will augment then ease my woe 
and wilt thou not be mou d with female
words 
thy mother was no goddesse periurd man 
nor dardanus the author of thy stocke:
but thou art sprung from scythian caucasus 
and tygers of hircania gaue thee sucke:
ah foolish dido to forbeare this long 
wast thou not wrackt vpon this libian shoare 
and cam st to dido like a fisherswaine 
repairde not i thy ships made thee a king 
and all thy needie followers noblemen 
o serpent that came creeping from the shoare 
and i for pitie harbord in my bosome 
wilt thou now slay me with thy venomed sting 
and hisse at dido for preseruing thee 
goe goe and spare not seeke out italy 
i hope that that which loue forbids me doe 
the rockes and sea-gulfes will performe at large 
and thou shalt perish in the billowes waies 
to whom poore dido doth bequeath reuenge 
i traytor and the waues shall cast thee vp 
where thou and false achates first set foote:
which if it chaunce ile giue ye buriall 
and weepe vpon your liueles carcases 
though thou nor he will pitie me a whit
why star st thou in my face if thou wilt stay 
leape in mine armes mine armes are open wide:
if not turne from me and ile turne from thee 
for though thou hast the heart to say farewell 
i haue not power to stay thee: is he gone 
i but heele come againe he cannot goe 
he loues me to too well to serue me so:
yet he that in my sight would not relent 
will being absent be abdurate still
by this is he got to the water side 
and see the sailers take him by the hand 
but he shrinkes backe and now remembring me 
returnes amaine: welcome welcome my loue:
but wheres æneas ah hees gone hees gone 
what meanes my sister thus to raue and crye 
o anna my æneas is abourd 
and leauing me will saile to italy
once didst thou goe and he came backe againe 
now bring him backe and thou shalt be a queene 
and i will liue a priuate life with him
wicked æneas
call him not wicked sister speake him faire 
and looke vpon him with a mermaides eye 
tell him i neuer vow d at aulis gulfe
the desolation of his natiue troy 
nor sent a thousand ships vnto the walles 
nor euer violated faith to him:
request him gently anna to returne 
i craue but this he stay a tide or two 
that i may learne to beare it patiently 
if he depart thus suddenly i dye:
run anna run stay not to answere me
i goe faire sister heauens graunt good successe
o dido your little sonne ascanius
is gone he lay with me last night 
and in the morning he was stolne from me 
i thinke some fairies haue beguiled me
o cursed hagge and false dissembling wretch 
that slayest me with thy harsh and hellish tale 
thou for some pettie guift hast let him goe 
and i am thus deluded of my boy:
away with her to prison presently 
traytoresse too keend and cursed sorceresse
i know not what you meane by treason i 
i am as true as any one of yours
away with her suffer her not to speake
my sister comes i like not her sad lookes
before i came æneas was abourd 
and spying me hoyst vp the sailes amaine:
but i cride out æneas false æneas stay
then gan he wagge his hand which yet held vp 
made me suppose he would haue heard me speake:
then gan they driue into the ocean 
which when i viewd i cride æneas stay 
dido faire dido wils æneas stay:
yet he whose heart of adamant or flint 
my teares nor plaints could mollifie a whit:
then carelesly i rent my haire for griefe 
which seene to all though he beheld me not 
they gan to moue him to redresse my ruth 
and stay a while to heare what i could say 
but he clapt vnder hatches saild away
o anna anna i will follow him
how can ye goe when he hath all your fleete 
ile frame me wings of waxe like icarus 
and ore his ships will soare vnto the sunne 
that they may melt and i fall in his armes:
or els ile make a prayer vnto the waues 
that i may swim to him like tritons neece:
o anna fetch orions harpe 
that i may tice a dolphin to the shoare 
and ride vpon his backe vnto my loue:
looke sister looke louely æneas ships 
see see the billowes heaue him vp to heauen 
and now downe falles the keeles into the deepe:
o sister sister take away the rockes 
theile breake his ships o proteus neptune ioue 
saue saue æneas leefest loue 
now is he come on shoare safe without hurt:
but see achates wils him put to sea 
and all the sailers merrie make for ioy 
but he remembring me shrinkes backe againe:
see where he comes welcome welcome my loue
ah sister leaue these idle fantasies 
sweet sister cease remember who you are
female 
i am vnlesse i be deceiu d 
and must i raue thus for a renegate 
must i make ships for him to saile away 
nothing can beare me to him but a ship 
and he hath all thy fleete what shall i doe 
but dye in furie of this ouersight 
i i must be the murderer of my selfe:
no but i am not yet i will be straight
anna be glad now haue i found a meane
to rid me from these thoughts of lunacie:
not farre from hence there is a woman famoused for arts 
daughter vnto the nimphs hesperides 
who wild me sacrifice his ticing relliques:
goe anna bid my seruants bring me fire 
iarbus talk not of æneas let him goe 
lay to thy hands and helpe me make a fire 
that shall consume all that this stranger left 
for i entend a priuate sacrifize 
to cure my minde that melts for vnkind loue
i i iarbus after this is done 
none in the world shall have my loue but thou:
so leaue me now let none approach this place 
now dido with these reliques burne thy selfe 
and make æneas famous through the world 
for periurie and slaughter of a queene:
here lye the sword that in the darksome caue
he drew and swore by to be true to me 
thou shalt burne first thy crime is worse then his:
here lye the garment which i cloath d him in 
when first he came on shoare perish thou to:
these letters lines and periurd papers all 
shall burne to cinders in this prectious flame
and now ye gods that guide the starrie frame 
and order all things at your high dispose 
graunt though the traytors land in italy 
they may be still tormented with vnrest 
and from mine ashes let a conquerour rise 
that may reuenge this treason to a queene 
by plowing vp his countries with the sword:
betwixt this land and that be neuer league 
littora littoribus contraria fluctibus undas
impresor: arma armis: pugnent ipsig nepotes:
liue false æneas truest dido dyes 
sic sic inuat ire sub umbras
o helpe iarbus dido in these flames
hath burnt her selfe aye me vnhappie me 
what can my teares or cryes preuaile me now 
dido is dead iarbus slaine iarbus my deare loue 
o sweet iarbus female
sole delight 
what fatall destinie enuies me thus 
to see my sweet iarbus slay himselfe 
but anna now shall honor thee in death 
and mixe her bloud with thine this shall i doe 
that gods and men may pitie this my death 
and rue our ends senceles of life or breath 
now sweet iarbus stay i come to thee
