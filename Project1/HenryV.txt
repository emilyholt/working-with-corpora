where is my gracious lord of canterbury
send for him good uncle
not yet my cousin we would be resolved
before we hear him of some things of weight
that task our thoughts concerning us and france enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely
sure we thank you
my learned lord we pray you to proceed
and justly and religiously unfold
why the law salique that they have in france
or should or should not bar us in our claim
and god forbid my dear and faithful lord
that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading
or nicely charge your understanding soul
with opening titles miscreate whose right
suits not in native colors with the truth
for god doth know how many now in health
shall drop their blood in approbation
of what your reverence shall incite us to
therefore take heed how you impawn our person
how you awake our sleeping sword of war
we charge you in the name of god take heed
for never two such kingdoms did contend
without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops
are every one a woe a sore complaint
gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
that make such waste in brief mortality
under this conjuration speak my lord
for we will hear note and believe in heart
that what you speak is in your conscience wash d
as pure as sin with baptism
may i with right and conscience make this claim
we must not only arm to invade the french
but lay down our proportions to defend
against the scot who will make road upon us
with all advantages
we do not mean the coursing snatchers only
but fear the main intendment of the scot
who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us
for you shall read that my great grandfather
never went with his forces into france
but that the scot on his unfurnish d kingdom
came pouring like the tide into a breach
with ample and brim fulness of his force
galling the gleaned land with hot assays
girding with grievous siege castles and towns
that england being empty of defence
hath shook and trembled at the ill neighborhood
call in the messengers sent from the dauphin exeunt some attendants
now are we well resolved and by god s help
and yours the noble sinews of our power
france being ours we ll bend it to our awe
or break it all to pieces or there we ll sit
ruling in large and ample empery
o er france and all her almost kingly dukedoms
or lay these bones in an unworthy urn
tombless with no remembrance over them
either our history shall with full mouth
speak freely of our acts or else our grave
like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth
not worshipp d with a waxen epitaph enter ambassadors of france
now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear
your greeting is from him not from the king
we are no tyrant but a christian king
unto whose grace our passion is as subject
as are our wretches fetter d in our prisons
therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
tell us the dauphin s mind
what treasure uncle
we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us
his present and your pains we thank you for
when we have march d our rackets to these balls
we will in france by god s grace play a set
shall strike his father s crown into the hazard
tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
that all the courts of france will be disturb d
with chaces and we understand him well
how he comes o er us with our wilder days
not measuring what use we made of them
we never valued this poor seat of england
and therefore living hence did give ourself
to barbarous license as tis ever common
that men are merriest when they are from home
but tell the dauphin i will keep my state
be like a king and show my sail of greatness
when i do rouse me in my throne of france
for that i have laid by my majesty
and plodded like a man for working days
but i will rise there with so full a glory
that i will dazzle all the eyes of france
yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us
and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
hath turn d his balls to gun stones and his soul
shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows
shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands
mock mothers from their sons mock castles down
and some are yet ungotten and unborn
that shall have cause to curse the dauphin s scorn
but this lies all within the will of god
to whom i do appeal and in whose name
tell you the dauphin i am coming on
to venge me as i may and to put forth
my rightful hand in a well hallow d cause
so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin
his jest will savor but of shallow wit
when thousands weep more than did laugh at it
convey them with safe conduct fare you well exeunt ambassadors
we hope to make the sender blush at it
therefore my lords omit no happy hour
that may give furtherance to our expedition
for we have now no thought in us but france
save those to god that run before our business
therefore let our proportions for these wars
be soon collected and all things thought upon
that may with reasonable swiftness add
more feathers to our wings for god before
we ll chide this dauphin at his father s door
therefore let every man now task his thought
that this fair action may on foot be brought exeunt flourish
now sits the wind fair and we will aboard
my lord of cambridge and my kind lord of masham
and you my gentle knight give me your thoughts
think you not that the powers we bear with us
will cut their passage through the force of france
doing the execution and the act
for which we have in head assembled them
i doubt not that since we are well persuaded
we carry not a heart with us from hence
that grows not in a fair consent with ours
nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
success and conquest to attend on us
we therefore have great cause of thankfulness
and shall forget the office of our hand
sooner than quittance of desert and merit
according to the weight and worthiness
we judge no less uncle of exeter
enlarge the man committed yesterday
that rail d against our person we consider
it was excess of wine that set him on
and on his more advice we pardon him
o let us yet be merciful
alas your too much love and care of me
are heavy orisons gainst this poor wretch
if little faults proceeding on distemper
shall not be wink d at how shall we stretch our eye
when capital crimes chew d swallow d and digested
appear before us we ll yet enlarge that man
though cambridge scroop and grey in their dear care
and tender preservation of our person
would have him punish d and now to our french causes
who are the late commissioners
then richard earl of cambridge there is yours
there yours lord scroop of masham and sir knight
grey of northumberland this same is yours
read them and know i know your worthiness
my lord of westmoreland and uncle exeter
we will aboard to night why how now gentlemen
what see you in those papers that you lose
so much complexion look ye how they change
their cheeks are paper why what read you there
that hath so cowarded and chased your blood
out of appearance
the mercy that was quick in us but late
by your own counsel is suppress d and kill d
you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy
for your own reasons turn into your bosoms
as dogs upon their masters worrying you
see you my princes and my noble peers
these english monsters my lord of cambridge here
you know how apt our love was to accord
to furnish him with all appertinents
belonging to his honor and this man
hath for a few light crowns lightly conspired
and sworn unto the practices of france
to kill us here in hampton to the which
this knight no less for bounty bound to us
than cambridge is hath likewise sworn but o
what shall i say to thee lord scroop thou cruel
ingrateful savage and inhuman creature
thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels
that knew st the very bottom of my soul
that almost mightst have coin d me into gold
wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use
may it be possible that foreign hire
could out of thee extract one spark of evil
that might annoy my finger tis so strange
that though the truth of it stands off as gross
as black and white my eye will scarcely see it
treason and murder ever kept together
as two yoke devils sworn to either s purpose
working so grossly in a natural cause
that admiration did not whoop at them
but thou gainst all proportion didst bring in
wonder to wait on treason and on murder
and whatsoever cunning fiend it was
that wrought upon thee so preposterously
hath got the voice in hell for excellence
all other devils that suggest by treasons
do botch and bungle up damnation
with patches colors and with forms being fetch d
from glistering semblance of piety
but he that temper d thee bade thee stand up
gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
unless to dub thee with the name of traitor
if that same demon that hath gull d thee thus
should with his lion gait walk the whole world
he might return to vasty tartar back
and tell the legions i can never win
a soul so easy as that englishman s
o how hast thou with jealousy infected
the sweetness of affiance show men dutiful
why so didst thou seem they grave and learned
why so didst thou come they of noble family
why so didst thou seem they religious
why so didst thou or are they spare in diet
free from gross passion or of mirth or anger
constant in spirit not swerving with the blood
garnish d and deck d in modest complement
not working with the eye without the ear
and but in purged judgement trusting neither
such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
to mark the full fraught man and best indued
with some suspicion i will weep for thee
for this revolt of thine methinks is like
another fall of man their faults are open
arrest them to the answer of the law
and god acquit them of their practices
god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence
you have conspired against our royal person
join d with an enemy proclaim d and from his coffers
received the golden earnest of our death
wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter
his princes and his peers to servitude
his subjects to oppression and contempt
and his whole kingdom into desolation
touching our person seek we no revenge
but we our kingdom s safety must so tender
whose ruin you have sought that to her laws
we do deliver you get you therefore hence
poor miserable wretches to your death
the taste whereof god of his mercy give
you patience to endure and true repentance
of all your dear offences bear them hence exeunt cambridge scroop and grey guarded
now lords for france the enterprise whereof
shall be to you as us like glorious
we doubt not of a fair and lucky war
since god so graciously hath brought to light
this dangerous treason lurking in our way
to hinder our beginnings we doubt not now
but every rub is smoothed on our way
then forth dear countrymen let us deliver
our puissance into the hand of god
putting it straight in expedition
cheerly to sea the signs of war advance
no king of england if not king of france exeunt
once more unto the breach dear friends once more
or close the wall up with our english dead
in peace there s nothing so becomes a man
as modest stillness and humility
but when the blast of war blows in our ears
then imitate the action of the tiger
stiffen the sinews summon up the blood
disguise fair nature with hard favor d rage
then lend the eye a terrible aspect
let it pry through the portage of the head
like the brass cannon let the brow o erwhelm it
as fearfully as doth a galled rock
o erhang and jutty his confounded base
swill d with the wild and wasteful ocean
now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide
hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
to his full height on on you noblest english
whose blood is fet from fathers of war proof
fathers that like so many alexanders
have in these parts from morn till even fought
and sheathed their swords for lack of argument
dishonor not your mothers now attest
that those whom you call d fathers did beget you
be copy now to men of grosser blood
and teach them how to war and you good yeomen
whose limbs were made in england show us here
the mettle of your pasture let us swear
that you are worth your breeding which i doubt not
for there is none of you so mean and base
that hath not noble lustre in your eyes
i see you stand like greyhounds in the slips
straining upon the start the game s afoot
follow your spirit and upon this charge
cry god for harry england and saint george exeunt alarum and chambers go off
how yet resolves the governor of the town
this is the latest parley we will admit
therefore to our best mercy give yourselves
or like to men proud of destructon
defy us to our worst for as i am a soldier
a name that in my thoughts becomes me best
if i begin the battery once again
i will not leave the half achieved harfleur
till in her ashes she lie buried
the gates of mercy shall be all shut up
and the flesh d soldier rough and hard of heart
in liberty of bloody hand shall range
with conscience wide as hell mowing like grass
your fresh fair virgins and your flowering infants
what is it then to me if impious war
array d in flames like to the prince of fiends
do with his smirch d complexion all fell feats
enlink d to waste and desolation
what is t to me when you yourselves are cause
if your pure maidens fall into the hand
of hot and forcing violation
what rein can hold licentious wickedness
when down the hill he holds his fierce career
we may as bootless spend our vain command
upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
as send precepts to the leviathan
to come ashore therefore you men of harfleur
take pity of your town and of your people
whiles yet my soldiers are in my command
whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
o erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
of heady murder spoil and villany
if not why in a moment look to see
the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
defile the locks of your shrill shrieking daughters
your fathers taken by the silver beards
and their most reverend heads dash d to the walls
your naked infants spitted upon pikes
whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
do break the clouds as did the wives of jewry
at herod s bloody hunting slaughtermen
what say you will you yield and thus avoid
or guilty in defence be thus destroy d
open your gates come uncle exeter
go you and enter harfleur there remain
and fortify it strongly gainst the french
use mercy to them all for us dear uncle
the winter coming on and sickness growing
upon our soldiers we will retire to calais
to night in harfleur will we be your guest
to morrow for the march are we addrest flourish the king and his train enter the town
how now fluellen camest thou from the bridge
what men have you lost fluellen
what is thy name i know thy quality
thou dost thy office fairly turn thee back
and tell thy king i do not seek him now
but could be willing to march on to calais
without impeachment for to say the sooth
though tis no wisdom to confess so much
unto an enemy of craft and vantage
my people are with sickness much enfeebled
my numbers lessen d and those few i have
almost no better than so many french
who when they were in health i tell thee herald
i thought upon one pair of english legs
did march three frenchmen yet forgive me god
that i do brag thus this your air of france
hath blown that vice in me i must repent
go therefore tell thy master here i am
my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk
my army but a weak and sickly guard
yet god before tell him we will come on
though france himself and such another neighbour
stand in our way there s for thy labour montjoy
go bid thy master well advise himself
if we may pass we will if we be hinder d
we shall your tawny ground with your red blood
discolour and so montjoy fare you well
the sum of a l our answer is but this
we would not seek a battle as we are
nor as we are we say we will not shun it
so tell your master
we are in god s hand brother not in theirs
march to the bridge it now draws toward night
beyond the river we ll encamp ourselves
and on to morrow bid them march away exeunt
gloucester tis true that we are in great danger
the greater therefore should our courage be
good morrow brother bedford god almighty
there is some soul of goodness in things evil
would men observingly distil it out
for our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers
which is both healthful and good husbandry
besides they are our outward consciences
and preachers to us all admonishing
that we should dress us fairly for our end
thus may we gather honey from the weed
and make a moral of the devil himself enter erpingham
good morrow old sir thomas erpingham
a good soft pillow for that good white head
were better than a churlish turf of france
tis good for men to love their present pains
upon example so the spirit is eased
and when the mind is quicken d out of doubt
the organs though defunct and dead before
break up their drowsy grave and newly move
with casted slough and fresh legerity
lend me thy cloak sir thomas brothers both
commend me to the princes in our camp
do my good morrow to them and anon
desire them all to my pavilion
no my good knight
go with my brothers to my lords of england
i and my bosom must debate a while
and then i would no other company
god a mercy old heart thou speak st cheerfully enter pistol
though it appear a little out of fashion
there is much care and valor in this welshman enter three soldiers john bates alexander court and michael williams
upon the king let us our lives our souls
our debts our careful wives
our children and our sins lay on the king
we must bear all o hard condition
twin born with greatness subject to the breath
of every fool whose sense no more can feel
but his own wringing what infinite heart sease
must kings neglect that private men enjoy
and what have kings that privates have not too
save ceremony save general ceremony
and what art thou thou idol ceremony
what kind of god art thou that suffer st more
of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers
what are thy rents what are thy comings in
o ceremony show me but thy worth
what is thy soul of adoration
art thou aught else but place degree and form
creating awe and fear in other men
wherein thou art less happy being fear d
than they in fearing
what drink st thou oft instead of homage sweet
but poison d flattery o be sick great greatness
and bid thy ceremony give thee cure
think st thou the fiery fever will go out
with titles blown from adulation
will it give place to flexure and low bending
canst thou when thou command st the beggar s knee
command the health of it no thou proud dream
that play st so subtly with a king s repose
i am a king that find thee and i know
tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball
the sword the mace the crown imperial
the intertissued robe of gold and pearl
the farced title running fore the king
the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp
that beats upon the high shore of this world
no not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony
not all these laid in bed majestical
can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave
who with a body fill d and vacant mind
gets him to rest cramm d with distressful bread
never sees horrid night the child of hell
but like a lackey from the rise to set
sweats in the eye of phoebus and all night
sleeps in elysium next day after dawn
doth rise and help hyperion to his horse
and follows so the ever running year
with profitable labor to his grave
and but for ceremony such a wretch
winding up days with toil and nights with sleep
had the fore hand and vantage of a king
the slave a member of the country s peace
enjoys it but in gross brain little wots
what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace
whose hours the peasant best advantages re enter erpingham
good old knight
collect them all together at my tent
i ll be before thee
o god of battles steel my soldiers hearts
possess them not with fear take from them now
the sense of reckoning if the opposed numbers
pluck their hearts from them not to day o lord
o not to day think not upon the fault
my father made in compassing the crown
i richard s body have interred anew
and on it have bestow d more contrite tears
than from it issued forced drops of blood
five hundred poor i have in yearly pay
who twice a day their wither d hands hold up
toward heaven to pardon blood and i have built
two chantries where the sad and solemn priests
sing still for richard s soul more will i do
though all that i can do is nothing worth
since that my penitence comes after all
imploring pardon re enter gloucester
my brother gloucester s voice ay
i know thy errand i will go with thee
the day my friends and all things stay for me exeunt
what s he that wishes so
my cousin westmoreland no my fair cousin
if we are mark d to die we are enow
to do our country loss and if to live
the fewer men the greater share of honor
god s will i pray thee wish not one man more
by jove i am not covetous for gold
nor care i who doth feed upon my cost
it yearns me not if men my garments wear
such outward things dwell not in my desires
but if it be a sin to covet honor
i am the most offending soul alive
no faith my coz wish not a man from england
god s peace i would not lose so great an honor
as one man more methinks would share from me
for the best hope i have o do not wish one more
rather proclaim it westmoreland through my host
that he which hath no stomach to this fight
let him depart his passport shall be made
and crowns for convoy put into his purse
we would not die in that man s company
that fears his fellowship to die with us
this day is call d the feast of crispian
he that outlives this day and comes safe home
will stand a tip toe when this day is named
and rouse him at the name of crispian
he that shall live this day and see old age
will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors
and say to morrow is saint crispian
then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars
and say these wounds i had on crispin s day
old men forget yet all shall be forgot
but he ll remember with advantages
what feats he did that day then shall our names
familiar in his mouth as household words
harry the king bedford and exeter
warwick and talbot salisbury and gloucester
be in their flowing cups freshly remember d
this story shall the good man teach his son
and crispin crispian shall ne er go by
from this day to the ending of the world
but we in it shall be remembered
we few we happy few we band of brothers
for he to day that sheds his blood with me
shall be my brother be he ne er so vile
this day shall gentle his condition
and gentlemen in england now a bed
shall think themselves accursed they were not here
and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
that fought with us upon saint crispin s day re enter salisbury
all things are ready if our minds be so
thou dost not wish more help from england coz
why now thou hast unwish d five thousand men
which likes me better than to wish us one
you know your places god be with you all tucket enter montjoy
who hath sent thee now
i pray thee bear my former answer back
bid them achieve me and then sell my bones
good god why should they mock poor fellows thus
the man that once did sell the lion s skin
while the beast lived was killed with hunting him
a many of our bodies shall no doubt
find native graves upon the which i trust
shall witness live in brass of this day s work
and those that leave their valiant bones in france
dying like men though buried in your dunghills
they shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them
and draw their honors reeking up to heaven
leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
the smell whereof shall breed a plague in france
mark then abounding valor in our english
that being dead like to the bullet s grazing
break out into a second course of mischief
killing in relapse of mortality
let me speak proudly tell the constable
we are but warriors for the working day
our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch d
with rainy marching in the painful field
there s not a piece of feather in our host
good argument i hope we will not fly
and time hath worn us into slovenry
but by the mass our hearts are in the trim
and my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night
they ll be in fresher robes or they will pluck
the gay new coats o er the french soldiers heads
and turn them out of service if they do this
as if god please they shall my ransom then
will soon be levied herald save thou thy labor
come thou no more for ransom gentle herald
they shall have none i swear but these my joints
which if they have as i will leave em them
shall yield them little tell the constable
i fear thou lt once more come again for ransom enter york
take it brave york now soldiers march away
and how thou pleasest god dispose the day exeunt
well have we done thrice valiant countrymen
but all s not done yet keep the french the field
lives he good uncle thrice within this hour
i saw him down thrice up again and fighting
from helmet to the spur all blood he was
i blame you not
for hearing this i must perforce compound
with mistful eyes or they will issue too alarum
but hark what new alarum is this same
the french have reinforced their scatter d men
then every soldier kill his prisoners
give the word through exeunt
i was not angry since i came to france
until this instant take a trumpet herald
ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill
if they will fight with us bid them come down
or void the field they do offend our sight
if they ll do neither we will come to them
and make them skirr away as swift as stones
enforced from the old assyrian slings
besides we ll cut the throats of those we have
and not a man of them that we shall take
shall taste our mercy go and tell them so enter montjoy
how now what means this herald know st thou not
that i have fined these bones of mine for ransom
comest thou again for ransom
i tell thee truly herald
i know not if the day be ours or no
for yet a many of your horsemen peer
and gallop o er the field
praised be god and not our strength for it
what is this castle call d that stands hard by
then call we this the field of agincourt
fought on the day of crispin crispianus
i wear it for a memorable honor
for i am welsh you know good countryman

the glove which i have given him for a favor
may haply purchase him a box o th ear
it is the soldier s i by bargain should
wear it myself follow good cousin warwick
if that the soldier strike him as i judge
by his blunt bearing he will keep his word
some sudden mischief may arise of it
for i do know fluellen valiant
and touch d with choler hot as gunpowder
and quickly will return an injury
follow and see there be no harm between them
go you with me uncle of exeter exeunt
here uncle exeter fill this glove with crowns
and give it to this fellow keep it fellow
and wear it for an honor in thy cap
