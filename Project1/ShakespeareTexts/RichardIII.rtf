\f1\b0 \cf2 Now is the winter of our discontent\
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;\
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house\
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;\
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;\
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,\
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.\
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;\
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds\
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,\
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber\
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.\
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,\
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;\
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty\
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;\
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,\
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,\
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time\
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,\
And that so lamely and unfashionable\
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;\
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,\
Have no delight to pass away the time,\
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun\
And descant on mine own deformity:\
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,\
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,\
I am determined to prove a villain\
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.\
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,\
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,\
To set my brother Clarence and the king\
In deadly hate the one against the other:\
And if King Edward be as true and just\
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,\
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,\
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'\
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.\
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here\
Clarence comes.\
Brother, good day; what means this armed guard\
That waits upon your grace?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CLARENCE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 His majesty\
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed\
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Upon what cause?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CLARENCE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Because my name is George.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;\
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:\
O, belike his majesty hath some intent\
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.\
But what's the matter, Clarence? may I know?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CLARENCE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest\
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,\
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;\
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.\
And says a wizard told him that by G\
His issue disinherited should be;\
And, for my name of George begins with G,\
It follows in his thought that I am he.\
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these\
Have moved his highness to commit me now.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:\
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:\
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she\
That tempers him to this extremity.\
Was it not she and that good man of worship,\
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,\
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,\
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?\
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CLARENCE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 By heaven, I think there's no man is secure\
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds\
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.\
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant\
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Humbly complaining to her deity\
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.\
I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,\
If we will keep in favour with the king,\
To be her men and wear her livery:\
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,\
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.\
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BRAKENBURY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I beseech your graces both to pardon me;\
His majesty hath straitly given in charge\
That no man shall have private conference,\
Of what degree soever, with his brother.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,\
You may partake of any thing we say:\
We speak no treason, man: we say the king\
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen\
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;\
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,\
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;\
And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:\
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BRAKENBURY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,\
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,\
Were best he do it secretly, alone.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BRAKENBURY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What one, my lord?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BRAKENBURY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal\
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CLARENCE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.\
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;\
And whatsoever you will employ me in,\
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,\
I will perform it to enfranchise you.\
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood\
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CLARENCE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I know it pleaseth neither of us well.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;\
Meantime, have patience.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CLARENCE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I must perforce. Farewell.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.\
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,\
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,\
If heaven will take the present at our hands.\
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Good time of day unto my gracious lord!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 As much unto my good lord chamberlain!\
Well are you welcome to the open air.\
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:\
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks\
That were the cause of my imprisonment.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;\
For they that were your enemies are his,\
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,\
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What news abroad?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 No news so bad abroad as this at home;\
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,\
And his physicians fear him mightily.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.\
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,\
And overmuch consumed his royal person:\
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.\
What, is he in his bed?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 He is.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Go you before, and I will follow you.\
He cannot live, I hope; and must not die\
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.\
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,\
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;\
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,\
Clarence hath not another day to live:\
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,\
And leave the world for me to bustle in!\
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.\
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?\
The readiest way to make the wench amends\
Is to become her husband and her father:\
The which will I; not all so much for love\
As for another secret close intent,\
By marrying her which I must reach unto.\
But yet I run before my horse to market:\
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:\
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Set down, set down your honourable load,\
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,\
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament\
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.\
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!\
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!\
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!\
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,\
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,\
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,\
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!\
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,\
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.\
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!\
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!\
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!\
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,\
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,\
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,\
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!\
If ever he have child, abortive be it,\
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,\
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect\
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;\
And that be heir to his unhappiness!\
If ever he have wife, let her he made\
A miserable by the death of him\
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!\
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,\
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;\
And still, as you are weary of the weight,\
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.\

Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,\
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,\
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.\

Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,\

For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,\
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.\
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,\
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.\
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds\
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!\
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;\
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood\
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;\
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,\
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.\
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!\
O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!\
Either heaven with lightning strike the\

Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,\
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood\
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!\

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 So will it, madam till I lie with you.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I hope so.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,\
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,\
And fall somewhat into a slower method,\
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths\
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,\
As blameful as the executioner?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Your beauty was the cause of that effect;\
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep\
To undertake the death of all the world,\
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,\
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;\
You should not blemish it, if I stood by:\
As all the world is cheered by the sun,\
So I by that; it is my day, my life.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I would I were, to be revenged on thee.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 It is a quarrel most unnatural,\
To be revenged on him that loveth you.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 It is a quarrel just and reasonable,\
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,\
Did it to help thee to a better husband.\

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Plantagenet.\

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Why, that was he.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The selfsame name, but one of better nature.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Where is he?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Here.\
Why dost thou spit at me?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Never came poison from so sweet a place.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Never hung poison on a fouler toad.\
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I would they were, that I might die at once;\
For now they kill me with a living death.\
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,\
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:\
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,\
No, when my father York and Edward wept,\
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made\
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;\
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,\
Told the sad story of my father's death,\
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,\
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks\
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time\
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;\
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,\
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.\
I never sued to friend nor enemy;\
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;\
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,\
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.\
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made\
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.\
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,\
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;\
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.\
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,\
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,\
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.\
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,\
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.\
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,\
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.\
Take up the sword again, or take up me.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,\
I will not be the executioner.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I have already.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Tush, that was in thy rage:\
Speak it again, and, even with the word,\
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,\
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;\
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I would I knew thy heart.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 'Tis figured in my tongue.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I fear me both are false.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Then never man was true.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Well, well, put up your sword.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Say, then, my peace is made.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 That shall you know hereafter.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 But shall I live in hope?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 All men, I hope, live so.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Vouchsafe to wear this ring.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 To take is not to give.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.\
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;\
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.\
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may\
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,\
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What is it?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 That it would please thee leave these sad designs\
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,\
And presently repair to Crosby Place;\
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd\
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,\
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,\
I will with all expedient duty see you:\
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,\
Grant me this boon.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 With all my heart; and much it joys me too,\
To see you are become so penitent.\
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Bid me farewell.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LADY ANNE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 'Tis more than you deserve;\
But since you teach me how to flatter you,\
Imagine I have said farewell already.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Sirs, take up the corse.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GENTLEMEN\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Towards Chertsey, noble lord?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.\
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?\
Was ever woman in this humour won?\
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.\
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,\
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,\
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,\
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;\
Having God, her conscience, and these bars\
against me,\
And I nothing to back my suit at all,\
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,\
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!\
Ha!\
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,\
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,\
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?\
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,\
Framed in the prodigality of nature,\
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,\
The spacious world cannot again afford\
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,\
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,\
And made her widow to a woful bed?\
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?\
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?\
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,\
I do mistake my person all this while:\
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,\
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.\
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,\
And entertain some score or two of tailors,\
To study fashions to adorn my body:\
Since I am crept in favour with myself,\
Will maintain it with some little cost.\
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;\
And then return lamenting to my love.\
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,\
That I may see my shadow as I pass.\

\f0\b \cf2 GREY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,\
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.\

\f0\b \cf2 RIVERS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 No other harm but loss of such a lord.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GREY\

\f1\b0 \cf2 The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,\
To be your comforter when he is gone.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Oh, he is young and his minority\
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,\
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.\

\f0\b \cf2 RIVERS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 It is determined, not concluded yet:\
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.\

\f0\b \cf2 GREY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 God make your majesty joyful as you have been!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.\
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.\
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,\
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured\
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 DERBY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I do beseech you, either not believe\
The envious slanders of her false accusers;\
Or, if she be accused in true report,\
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds\
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 RIVERS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?\

\f0\b \cf2 DERBY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 But now the Duke of Buckingham and I\
Are come from visiting his majesty.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What likelihood of his amendment, lords?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\

\f1\b0 \cf2 God grant him health! Did you confer with him?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement\
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,\
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;\
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Would all were well! but that will never be\
I fear our happiness is at the highest.\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:\
Who are they that complain unto the king,\
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?\
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly\
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.\
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,\
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,\
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,\
I must be held a rancorous enemy.\
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,\
But thus his simple truth must be abused\
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.\
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?\
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?\
A plague upon you all! His royal person,--\
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--\
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,\
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.\
The king, of his own royal disposition,\
And not provoked by any suitor else;\
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,\
Which in your outward actions shows itself\
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,\
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather\
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,\
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:\
Since every Jack became a gentleman\
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

You envy my advancement and my friends':\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:\
Your brother is imprison'd by your means,\
Myself disgraced, and the nobility\
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions\

\f1\b0 \cf2 By Him that raised me to this careful height\
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,\
I never did incense his majesty\
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been\
An earnest advocate to plead for him.\
My lord, you do me shameful injury,\
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?\
She may do more, sir, than denying that:\
She may help you to many fair preferments,\
And then deny her aiding hand therein,\
And lay those honours on your high deserts.\
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--\

\f0\b \cf2 RIVERS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What, marry, may she?\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What, marry, may she! marry with a king,\
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:\
I wis your grandam had a worser match.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne\
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:\
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty\
With those gross taunts I often have endured.\
I had rather be a country servant-maid\
Than a great queen, with this condition,\
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:\
Small joy have I in being England's queen.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN MARGARET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!\
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What! threat you me with telling of the king?\
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said\
I will avouch in presence of the king:\
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.\
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN MARGARET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,\
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;\
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,\
A liberal rewarder of his friends:\
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN MARGARET\

\f1\b0 \cf2 In all which time you and your husband Grey\
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;\
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband\
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?\
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,\
What you have been ere now, and what you are;\
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN MARGARET\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\

And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.\
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;\
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine\
I am too childish-foolish for this world.\

\f1\b0 \cf2 My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days\
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,\
We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:\
So should we you, if you should be our king.\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:\
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 As little joy, my lord, as you suppose\
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,\
As little joy may you suppose in me.\
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN MARGARET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;\
For I am she, and altogether joyless.\
I can no longer hold me patient.\
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out\
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!\
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?\
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,\
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?\
O gentle villain, do not turn away!\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN MARGARET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;\
That will I make before I let thee go.\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN MARGARET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I was; but I do find more pain in banishment\
Than death can yield me here by my abode.\
A husband and a son thou owest to me;\
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:\
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,\
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The curse my noble father laid on thee,\
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper\
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,\
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout\
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--\
His curses, then from bitterness of soul\
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;\
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.\

\f0\b \cf2 RIVERS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN MARGARET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What were you snarling all before I came,\
Ready to catch each other by the throat,\
And turn you all your hatred now on me?\
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?\
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,\
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,\
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?\
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?\
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!\
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,\
As ours by murder, to make him a king!\
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,\
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,\
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!\
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,\
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!\
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;\
And see another, as I see thee now,\
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!\
Long die thy happy days before thy death;\
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,\
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!\
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,\
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son\
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,\
That none of you may live your natural age,\
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!\

\f1\b0 \cf2 And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.\
If heaven have any grievous plague in store\
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,\
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,\
And then hurl down their indignation\
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!\
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!\
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,\
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!\
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,\
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream\
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!\
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!\
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity\
The slave of nature and the son of hell!\
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!\
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!\
Thou rag of honour! thou detested--\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN MARGARET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!\
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,\
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?\
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.\
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me\
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.\

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:\
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.\
O, that your young nobility could judge\
What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!\

And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.\

Witness my son, now in the shade of death;\
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath\
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Urge neither charity nor shame to me:\

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\

\f1\b0 \cf2 I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,\
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.\
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!\
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,\
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:\
Have not to do with him, beware of him;\
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,\
And all their ministers attend on him.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

I was too hot to do somebody good,\
That is too cold in thinking of it now.\
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,\

God pardon them that are the cause of it!\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\

\f1\b0 \cf2 I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.\
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach\
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.\
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,\
I do beweep to many simple gulls\
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;\
And say it is the queen and her allies\
That stir the king against the duke my brother.\
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me\
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:\

Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:\

Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,\
So full of dismal terror was the time!\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,\
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;\
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;\
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk\
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,\
And cited up a thousand fearful times,\
During the wars of York and Lancaster\
That had befall'n us. As we paced along\
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,\
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,\
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,\
Into the tumbling billows of the main.\
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!\
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!\
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!\
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;\
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;\
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,\
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,\
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:\
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes\
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,\
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,\
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,\
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Methought I had; and often did I strive\
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood\
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth\
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;\
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,\
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.\

\f1\b0 \cf2 O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;\
O, then began the tempest to my soul,\
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,\
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,\
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.\
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,\
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;\
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury\
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'\
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by\
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair\
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,\
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,\
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;\
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'\
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends\
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears\
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise\
I trembling waked, and for a season after\
Could not believe but that I was in hell,\
Such terrible impression made the dream.\

Which now bear evidence against my soul,\
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!\
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,\
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,\
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,\
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!\
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;\
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.\

Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,\
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.\
Princes have but their tides for their glories,\
An outward honour for an inward toil;\
And, for unfelt imagination,\
They often feel a world of restless cares:\
So that, betwixt their tides and low names,\
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.\

For in this sin he is as deep as I.\

Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,\
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?\
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,\
And yet his punishment was cruel death.\
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,\
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised\
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?\
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake\
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?\
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury\
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,\
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?\
Who told me, when we both lay in the field\
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me\
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,\
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?\
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath\
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you\
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.\
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals\
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced\
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,\
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;\
And I unjustly too, must grant it you\
But for my brother not a man would speak,\
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself\
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all\
Have been beholding to him in his life;\
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.\
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold\
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!\
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.\

Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,\
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:\
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,\
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,\

To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Who hath committed them?\

\f0\b \cf2 MESSENGER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The mighty dukes\
Gloucester and Buckingham.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 For what offence?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 MESSENGER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;\
Why or for what these nobles were committed\
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!\
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;\
Insulting tyranny begins to jet\
Upon the innocent and aweless throne:\
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!\
I see, as in a map, the end of all.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 DUCHESS OF YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,\
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!\
My husband lost his life to get the crown;\
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,\
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:\
And being seated, and domestic broils\
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.\
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,\
Self against self: O, preposterous\
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;\
Or let me die, to look on death no more!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.\
Madam, farewell.\

\f0\b \cf2 DUCHESS OF YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I'll go along with you.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My gracious lady, go;\
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.\
For my part, I'll resign unto your grace\
The seal I keep: and so betide to me\
As well I tender you and all of yours!\
Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.\

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign\
The weary way hath made you melancholy.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 No, uncle; but our crosses on the way\
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy\
I want more uncles here to welcome me.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years\
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit\
Nor more can you distinguish of a man\
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,\
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.\
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;\
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,\
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :\
God keep you from them, and from such false friends!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 God keep me from false friends! but they were none.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LORD MAYOR\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 God bless your grace with health and happy days!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.\
I thought my mother, and my brother York,\
Would long ere this have met us on the way\
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not\
To tell us whether they will come or no!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 On what occasion, God he knows, not I,\
The queen your mother, and your brother York,\
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince\
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,\
But by his mother was perforce withheld.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Fie, what an indirect and peevish course\
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace\
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York\
Unto his princely brother presently?\
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,\
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CARDINAL\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory\
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,\
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate\
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid\
We should infringe the holy privilege\
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land\
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,\
Too ceremonious and traditional\
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,\
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.\
The benefit thereof is always granted\
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,\
And those who have the wit to claim the place:\
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;\
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:\
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,\
You break no privilege nor charter there.\
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;\
But sanctuary children ne'er till now.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CARDINAL\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.\
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I go, my lord.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.\
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,\
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Where it seems best unto your royal self.\
If I may counsel you, some day or two\
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:\
Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit\
For your best health and recreation.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I do not like the Tower, of any place.\
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;\
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Is it upon record, or else reported\
Successively from age to age, he built it?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Upon record, my gracious lord.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 But say, my lord, it were not register'd,\
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,\
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,\
Even to the general all-ending day.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 [Aside] So wise so young, they say, do never\
live long.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What say you, uncle?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I say, without characters, fame lives long.\
Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,\
I moralize two meanings in one word.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 That Julius Caesar was a famous man;\
With what his valour did enrich his wit,\
His wit set down to make his valour live\
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;\
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.\
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What, my gracious lord?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 An if I live until I be a man,\
I'll win our ancient right in France again,\
Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 [Aside] Short summers lightly have a forward spring.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:\
Too late he died that might have kept that title,\
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,\
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth\
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 He hath, my lord.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 And therefore is he idle?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Then is he more beholding to you than I.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 He may command me as my sovereign;\
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 A beggar, brother?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;\
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 A gentle cousin, were it light enough.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;\
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 It is too heavy for your grace to wear.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What, would you have my weapon, little lord?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I would, that I might thank you as you call me.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 How?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Little.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:\
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:\
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;\
Because that I am little, like an ape,\
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!\
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,\
He prettily and aptly taunts himself:\
So cunning and so young is wonderful.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My lord, will't please you pass along?\
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham\
Will to your mother, to entreat of her\
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My lord protector needs will have it so.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:\
My grandam told me he was murdered there.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I fear no uncles dead.\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 PRINCE EDWARD\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 An if they live, I hope I need not fear.\
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,\
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Think you, my lord, this little prating York\
Was not incensed by his subtle mother\
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;\
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable\
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.\

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.\
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend\
As closely to conceal what we impart:\
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;\
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter\
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,\
For the instalment of this noble duke\
In the seat royal of this famous isle?\

\f0\b \cf2 CATESBY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

That he will not be won to aught against him.\

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?\

\f0\b \cf2 CATESBY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,\
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,\
How doth he stand affected to our purpose;\
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,\
To sit about the coronation.\
If thou dost find him tractable to us,\
Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:\
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,\
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,\
And give us notice of his inclination:\
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,\
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.\

And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me\

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\

\f1\b0 \cf2 I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Who knocks at the door?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 MESSENGER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 A messenger from the Lord Stanley.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What is't o'clock?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 MESSENGER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Upon the stroke of four.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 MESSENGER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 So it should seem by that I have to say.\
First, he commends him to your noble lordship.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 And then?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 MESSENGER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 And then he sends you word\
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:\
Besides, he says there are two councils held;\
And that may be determined at the one\
which may make you and him to rue at the other.\
Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,\
If presently you will take horse with him,\
And with all speed post with him toward the north,\
To shun the danger that his soul divines.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;\
Bid him not fear the separated councils\
His honour and myself are at the one,\
And at the other is my servant Catesby\
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us\
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.\
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:\
And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond\
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers\
To fly the boar before the boar pursues,\
Were to incense the boar to follow us\
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.\
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me\
And we will both together to the Tower,\
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 MESSENGER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.\

\f0\b \cf2 CATESBY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Many good morrows to my noble lord!\

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring\
What news, what news, in this our tottering state?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CATESBY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;\
And I believe twill never stand upright\
Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CATESBY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Ay, my good lord.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders\
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.\
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CATESBY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward\
Upon his party for the gain thereof:\
And thereupon he sends you this good news,\
That this same very day your enemies,\
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,\
Because they have been still mine enemies:\
But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,\
To bar my master's heirs in true descent,\
God knows I will not do it, to the death.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CATESBY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,\
That they who brought me in my master's hate\
I live to look upon their tragedy.\
I tell thee, Catesby--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CATESBY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What, my lord?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Ere a fortnight make me elder,\
I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CATESBY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,\
When men are unprepared and look not for it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out\
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do\
With some men else, who think themselves as safe\
As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear\
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CATESBY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The princes both make high account of you;\
For they account his head upon the bridge.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I know they do; and I have well deserved it.\
Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?\
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?\

\f0\b \cf2 STANLEY\

\f1\b0 \cf2 My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:\
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,\
I do not like these several councils, I.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My lord,\
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;\
And never in my life, I do protest,\
Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:\
Think you, but that I know our state secure,\
I would be so triumphant as I am?\

\f0\b \cf2 STANLEY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,\
Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,\
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;\
But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.\
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:\
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!\
What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.\

\f0\b \cf2 LORD STANLEY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

Than some that have accused them wear their hats.\
But come, my lord, let us away.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now\
Than when I met thee last where now we meet:\
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,\
By the suggestion of the queen's allies;\
But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--\
This day those enemies are put to death,\
And I in better state than e'er I was.\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.\
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,\
And finds the testy gentleman so hot,\
As he will lose his head ere give consent\
His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,\
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.\

\f1\b0 \cf2 We have not yet set down this day of triumph.\
To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;\
For I myself am not so well provided\
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.\

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;\
There's some conceit or other likes him well,\
When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.\
I think there's never a man in Christendom\
That can less hide his love or hate than he;\
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What of his heart perceive you in his face\
By any likelihood he show'd to-day?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Marry, that with no man here he is offended;\
For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.\

\f1\b0 \cf2 I pray you all, tell me what they deserve\
That do conspire my death with devilish plots\
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd\
Upon my body with their hellish charms?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,\
Makes me most forward in this noble presence\
To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be\
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:\
See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm\
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:\
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,\
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,\
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.\

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--\
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'? Thou art a traitor:\
Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,\
I will not dine until I see the same.\
Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:\
The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.\

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;\
For I, too fond, might have prevented this.\
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;\
But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:\
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,\
And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,\
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.\
O, now I want the priest that spake to me:\
I now repent I told the pursuivant\
As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,\
How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,\
And I myself secure in grace and favour.\
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse\
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!\

\f0\b \cf2 RATCLIFF\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:\
Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 O momentary grace of mortal men,\
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!\
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,\
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,\
Ready, with every nod, to tumble down\
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.\

\f0\b \cf2 LOVEL\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 HASTINGS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 O bloody Richard! miserable England!\
I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee\
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.\
Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.\
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,\
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,\
And then begin again, and stop again,\
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?\

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;\
Speak and look back, and pry on every side,\
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,\
Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks\
Are at my service, like enforced smiles;\
And both are ready in their offices,\
At any time, to grace my stratagems.\
But what, is Catesby gone?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Look to the drawbridge there!\

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 God and our innocency defend and guard us!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LOVEL\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,\
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.\
I took him for the plainest harmless creature\
That breathed upon this earth a Christian;\
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded\
The history of all her secret thoughts:\
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,\
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,\
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,\
He lived from all attainder of suspect.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor\
That ever lived.\
Would you imagine, or almost believe,\
Were't not that, by great preservation,\
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor\
This day had plotted, in the council-house\
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 Lord Mayor\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What, had he so?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What, think You we are Turks or infidels?\
Or that we would, against the form of law,\
Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,\
But that the extreme peril of the case,\
The peace of England and our persons' safety,\
Enforced us to this execution?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 Lord Mayor\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;\
And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,\
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.\
I never look'd for better at his hands,\
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Yet had not we determined he should die,\
Until your lordship came to see his death;\
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,\
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:\
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard\
The traitor speak, and timorously confess\
The manner and the purpose of his treason;\
That you might well have signified the same\
Unto the citizens, who haply may\
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 Lord Mayor\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,\
As well as I had seen and heard him speak\
And doubt you not, right noble princes both,\
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens\
With all your just proceedings in this cause.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,\
To avoid the carping censures of the world.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 But since you come too late of our intents,\
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:\
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.\
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:\
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,\
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:\
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,\
Only for saying he would make his son\
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,\
Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.\
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury\
And bestial appetite in change of lust;\
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,\
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,\
Without control, listed to make his prey.\
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:\
Tell them, when that my mother went with child\
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York\
My princely father then had wars in France\
And, by just computation of the time,\
Found that the issue was not his begot;\
Which well appeared in his lineaments,\
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:\
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,\
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator\
As if the golden fee for which I plead\
Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;\
Where you shall find me well accompanied\
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I go: and towards three or four o'clock\
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;\
Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both\
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.\
Now will I in, to take some privy order,\
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;\
And to give notice, that no manner of person\
At any time have recourse unto the princes.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 SCRIVENER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;\
Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,\
That it may be this day read over in Paul's.\
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:\
Eleven hours I spent to write it over,\
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;\
The precedent was full as long a-doing:\
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,\
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty\
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,\
That seeth not this palpable device?\
Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?\
Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,\
When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 How now, my lord, what say the citizens?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,\
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,\
And his contract by deputy in France;\
The insatiate greediness of his desires,\
And his enforcement of the city wives;\
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,\
As being got, your father then in France,\
His resemblance, being not like the duke;\
Withal I did infer your lineaments,\
Being the right idea of your father,\
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;\
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,\
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,\
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:\
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose\
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse\
And when mine oratory grew to an end\
I bid them that did love their country's good\
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Ah! and did they so?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 No, so God help me, they spake not a word;\
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,\
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.\
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;\
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:\
His answer was, the people were not wont\
To be spoke to but by the recorder.\
Then he was urged to tell my tale again,\
'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'\
But nothing spake in warrant from himself.\
When he had done, some followers of mine own,\
At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,\
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'\
And thus I took the vantage of those few,\
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;\
'This general applause and loving shout\
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'\
And even here brake off, and came away.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 No, by my troth, my lord.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?\

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;\
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:\
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,\
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;\
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:\
And be not easily won to our request:\
Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I go; and if you plead as well for them\
As I can say nay to thee for myself,\
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.\
Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;\
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.\
Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,\
What says he?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My lord: he doth entreat your grace;\
To visit him to-morrow or next day:\
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,\
Divinely bent to meditation;\
And no worldly suit would he be moved,\
To draw him from his holy exercise.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;\
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,\
In deep designs and matters of great moment,\
No less importing than our general good,\
Are come to have some conference with his grace.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!\
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,\
But on his knees at meditation;\
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,\
But meditating with two deep divines;\
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,\
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:\
Happy were England, would this gracious prince\
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:\
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.\

\f0\b \cf2 LORD MAYOR\

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I fear he will.\
How now, Catesby, what says your lord?\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Sorry I am my noble cousin should\
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:\
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;\
And so once more return and tell his grace.\
When holy and devout religious men\

So sweet is zealous contemplation.\

\f1\b0 \cf2 My lord, there needs no such apology:\
I rather do beseech you pardon me,\
Who, earnest in the service of my God,\
Neglect the visitation of my friends.\
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,\
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.\

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I do suspect I have done some offence\
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,\
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.\

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,\
At our entreaties, to amend that fault!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Then know, it is your fault that you resign\
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,\
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,\
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,\
The lineal glory of your royal house,\
To the corruption of a blemished stock:\
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,\
Which here we waken to our country's good,\
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;\
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,\
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,\
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf\
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.\
Which to recure, we heartily solicit\
Your gracious self to take on you the charge\
And kingly government of this your land,\
Not as protector, steward, substitute,\
Or lowly factor for another's gain;\
But as successively from blood to blood,\
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.\
For this, consorted with the citizens,\
Your very worshipful and loving friends,\
And by their vehement instigation,\
In this just suit come I to move your grace.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 GLOUCESTER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I know not whether to depart in silence,\
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.\
Best fitteth my degree or your condition\
If not to answer, you might haply think\
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded\
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,\
Which fondly you would here impose on me;\
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,\
So season'd with your faithful love to me.\
Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.\
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,\
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,\
Definitively thus I answer you.\
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert\
Unmeritable shuns your high request.\
First if all obstacles were cut away,\
And that my path were even to the crown,\
As my ripe revenue and due by birth\
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,\
So mighty and so many my defects,\
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,\
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,\
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,\
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.\
But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,\
And much I need to help you, if need were;\
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,\
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,\
Will well become the seat of majesty,\
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.\
On him I lay what you would lay on me,\
The right and fortune of his happy stars;\
Which God defend that I should wring from him!\

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;\
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,\
All circumstances well considered.\
You say that Edward is your brother's son:\
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;\
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--\
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--\
And afterward by substitute betroth'd\
To Bona, sister to the King of France.\
These both put by a poor petitioner,\
A care-crazed mother of a many children,\
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,\
Even in the afternoon of her best days,\
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,\
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts\
To base declension and loathed bigamy\
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got\
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.\
More bitterly could I expostulate,\
Save that, for reverence to some alive,\
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.\
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self\
This proffer'd benefit of dignity;\
If non to bless us and the land withal,\
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry\
From the corruption of abusing times,\
Unto a lineal true-derived course.\

Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;\
As well we know your tenderness of heart\
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,\
Which we have noted in you to your kin,\
And egally indeed to all estates,--\
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,\
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;\
But we will plant some other in the throne,\
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:\
And in this resolution here we leave you.--\
Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Would you enforce me to a world of care?\
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,\
But penetrable to your. kind entreats,\
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.\
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,\
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,\
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,\
I must have patience to endure the load:\
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach\
Attend the sequel of your imposition,\
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me\
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;\
For God he knows, and you may partly see,\
How far I am from the desire thereof.\

If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,\
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell\
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,\
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;\
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,\
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.\

When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands\
Which issued from my other angel husband\
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;\
O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,\
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,\
For making me, so young, so old a widow!\
And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;\
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--\
As miserable by the life of thee\
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!\
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,\
Even in so short a space, my woman's heart\
Grossly grew captive to his honey words\
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,\
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;\
For never yet one hour in his bed\
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,\
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.\
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;\
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.\

No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:\
Hath he so long held out with me untired,\

How now! what news with you?\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Rumour it abroad\
That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:\
I will take order for her keeping close.\
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,\
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:\
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.\
Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out\
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:\
About it; for it stands me much upon,\
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.\
I must be married to my brother's daughter,\
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.\
Murder her brothers, and then marry her!\
Uncertain way of gain! But I am in\
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:\
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.\
Is thy name Tyrrel?\

Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers\
Are they that I would have thee deal upon:\

For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;\
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables\
The which you promised I should possess.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\

\f1\b0 \cf2 As I remember, Henry the Sixth\
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,\
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.\
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--\

Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,\
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,\
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,\
Because a bard of Ireland told me once\
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.\

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Upon the stroke of ten.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Why let it strike?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke\
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.\
I am not in the giving vein to-day.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 BUCKINGHAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Is it even so? rewards he my true service\
With such deep contempt made I him king for this?\
O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone\
To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 TYRREL\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.\
The most arch of piteous massacre\
That ever yet this land was guilty of.\
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn\
To do this ruthless piece of butchery,\
Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,\
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion\
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.\
'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'\
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another\
Within their innocent alabaster arms:\
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,\
Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.\
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;\
Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;\
But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd\
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered\
The most replenished sweet work of nature,\
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'\
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;\
They could not speak; and so I left them both,\
To bring this tidings to the bloody king.\
And here he comes.\
All hail, my sovereign liege!\

\f0\b \cf2 TYRREL\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 And buried, gentle Tyrrel?\

\f0\b \cf2 TYRREL\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;\
But how or in what place I do not know.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,\
And thou shalt tell the process of their death.\
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,\
And be inheritor of thy desire.\
Farewell till soon.\
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;\
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;\
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,\
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.\
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims\
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,\
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,\
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Ely with Richmond troubles me more near\
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.\
Come, I have heard that fearful commenting\
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;\
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary\
Then fiery expedition be my wing,\
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!\
Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;\
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.\

And drop into the rotten mouth of death.\
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,\
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.\
A dire induction am I witness to,\
And will to France, hoping the consequence\
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.\

From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept\
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:\
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,\
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,\
That foul defacer of God's handiwork,\
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,\
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,\
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.\
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,\
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur\
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,\
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!\

And now I cloy me with beholding it.\

Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;\
Young York he is but boot, because both they\
Match not the high perfection of my loss:\
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;\
And the beholders of this tragic play,\
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,\
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.\
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,\
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls\
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,\
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:\
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.\
To have him suddenly convey'd away.\
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,\
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN MARGARET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;\
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;\
The presentation of but what I was;\
The flattering index of a direful pageant;\
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;\
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;\
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,\
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,\
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,\
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.\
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?\
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?\
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?\
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?\
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?\
Decline all this, and see what now thou art:\
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;\
For joyful mother, one that wails the name;\
For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;\
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;\
For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;\
For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;\
For one commanding all, obey'd of none.\
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,\
And left thee but a very prey to time;\
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,\
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.\
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not\
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?\
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;\
From which even here I slip my weary neck,\
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.\
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:\
These English woes will make me smile in France.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,\
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN MARGARET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;\
Compare dead happiness with living woe;\
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,\
And he that slew them fouler than he is:\
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:\
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN MARGARET\

\f0\b \cf2 DUCHESS OF YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Windy attorneys to their client woes,\
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,\
Poor breathing orators of miseries!\
Let them have scope: though what they do impart\
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.\

\f0\b \cf2 DUCHESS OF YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.\
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother\
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.\
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.\

\f0\b \cf2 DUCHESS OF YORK\

\f1\b0 \cf2 O, she that might have intercepted thee,\
By strangling thee in her accursed womb\
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,\

The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,\
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?\
Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\

\f1\b0 \cf2 A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!\
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women\
Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!\
Either be patient, and entreat me fair,\
Or with the clamorous report of war\
Thus will I drown your exclamations.\

\f0\b \cf2 DUCHESS OF YORK\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Madam, I have a touch of your condition,\
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.\

\f0\b \cf2 DUCHESS OF YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Do then: but I'll not hear.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 DUCHESS OF YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I will be mild and gentle in my speech.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 DUCHESS OF YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,\
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 DUCHESS OF YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,\
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.\
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;\
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;\
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,\
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,\
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,\
treacherous,\
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:\
What comfortable hour canst thou name,\
That ever graced me in thy company?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd\
your grace\
To breakfast once forth of my company.\
If I be so disgracious in your sight,\
Let me march on, and not offend your grace.\
Strike the drum.\

\f0\b \cf2 DUCHESS OF YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I prithee, hear me speak.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 You speak too bitterly.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 DUCHESS OF YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Hear me a word;\
For I shall never speak to thee again.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 So.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 DUCHESS OF YORK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,\
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,\
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish\
And never look upon thy face again.\
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;\
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more\
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!\
My prayers on the adverse party fight;\
And there the little souls of Edward's children\
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies\
And promise them success and victory.\
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;\
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse\
Abides in me; I say amen to all.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I have no more sons of the royal blood\
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,\
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;\
And therefore level not to hit their lives.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,\
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 And must she die for this? O, let her live,\
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;\
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;\
Throw over her the veil of infamy:\
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,\
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 To save her life, I'll say she is not so.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Her life is only safest in her birth.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 And only in that safety died her brothers.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 All unavoided is the doom of destiny.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 True, when avoided grace makes destiny:\
My babes were destined to a fairer death,\
If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd\
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.\
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,\
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:\
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt\
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,\
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.\
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,\
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys\
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;\
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,\
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,\
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise\
And dangerous success of bloody wars,\
As I intend more good to you and yours,\
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,\
To be discover'd, that can do me good?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The advancement of your children, gentle lady.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 No, to the dignity and height of honour\
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Flatter my sorrows with report of it;\
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,\
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,\
Will I withal endow a child of thine;\
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul\
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs\
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness\
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What do you think?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:\
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;\
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:\
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,\
And mean to make her queen of England.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Even he that makes her queen who should be else?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What, thou?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I, even I: what think you of it, madam?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 How canst thou woo her?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 That would I learn of you,\
As one that are best acquainted with her humour.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 And wilt thou learn of me?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Madam, with all my heart.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,\
A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave\
Edward and York; then haply she will weep:\
Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret\
Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--\
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain\
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body\
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.\
If this inducement force her not to love,\
Send her a story of thy noble acts;\
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,\
Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,\
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way\
To win our daughter.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 There is no other way\
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,\
And not be Richard that hath done all this.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Say that I did all this for love of her.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,\
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Look, what is done cannot be now amended:\
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,\
Which after hours give leisure to repent.\
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,\
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.\
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,\
To quicken your increase, I will beget\
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter\
A grandam's name is little less in love\
Than is the doting title of a mother;\
They are as children but one step below,\
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;\
Of an one pain, save for a night of groans\
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.\
Your children were vexation to your youth,\
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.\
The loss you have is but a son being king,\
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.\
I cannot make you what amends I would,\
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.\
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul\
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,\
This fair alliance quickly shall call home\
To high promotions and great dignity:\
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.\
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;\
Again shall you be mother to a king,\
And all the ruins of distressful times\
Repair'd with double riches of content.\
What! we have many goodly days to see:\
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed\
Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,\
Advantaging their loan with interest\
Of ten times double gain of happiness.\
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go\
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;\
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale\
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame\
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess\
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys\
And when this arm of mine hath chastised\
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,\
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come\
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;\
To whom I will retail my conquest won,\
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.\

\f1\b0 \cf2 What were I best to say? her father's brother\
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?\
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?\
Under what title shall I woo for thee,\
That God, the law, my honour and her love,\
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Say, I will love her everlastingly.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 But how long shall that title 'ever' last?\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\

\f1\b0 \cf2 But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Be eloquent in my behalf to her.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;\
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I swear--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 By nothing; for this is no oath:\
The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;\
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;\
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.\
if something thou wilt swear to be believed,\
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Now, by the world--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My father's death--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Thy life hath that dishonour'd.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Then, by myself--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Thyself thyself misusest.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Why then, by God--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 God's wrong is most of all.\
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,\
The unity the king thy brother made\
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:\
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,\
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,\
Had graced the tender temples of my child,\
And both the princes had been breathing here,\
Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,\
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.\
What canst thou swear by now?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The time to come.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;\
For I myself have many tears to wash\
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.\
The children live, whose parents thou hast\
slaughter'd,\
Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;\
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,\
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.\
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast\
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 As I intend to prosper and repent,\
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt\
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!\
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!\
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!\
Be opposite all planets of good luck\
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,\
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,\
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!\
In her consists my happiness and thine;\
Without her, follows to this land and me,\
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,\
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:\
It cannot be avoided but by this;\
It will not be avoided but by this.\
Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--\
Be the attorney of my love to her:\
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;\
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:\
Urge the necessity and state of times,\
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 But thou didst kill my children.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 But in your daughter's womb I bury them:\
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed\
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 And be a happy mother by the deed.\

\f0\b \cf2 QUEEN ELIZABETH\

And you shall understand from me her mind.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\

\f0\b \cf2 RATCLIFF\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My gracious sovereign, on the western coast\
Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore\
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,\
Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:\
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;\
And there they hull, expecting but the aid\
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:\
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?\

\f0\b \cf2 CATESBY\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Here, my lord.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Fly to the duke:\
Post thou to Salisbury\
When thou comest thither--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf2 Dull, unmindful villain,\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0
\cf2 Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 CATESBY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,\
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight\
The greatest strength and power he can make,\
And meet me presently at Salisbury.\

\f0\b \cf2 RATCLIFF\

\f1\b0 \cf2 What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at\
Salisbury?\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 RATCLIFF\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Your highness told me I should post before.\

Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\

Why dost thou run so many mile about,\
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?\
Once more, what news?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 STANLEY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Richmond is on the seas.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 There let him sink, and be the seas on him!\
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?\

\f0\b \cf2 STANLEY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 STANLEY\

\f1\b0 \cf2 Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,\
He makes for England, there to claim the crown.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?\
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?\
What heir of York is there alive but we?\
And who is England's king but great York's heir?\
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 STANLEY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Unless for that he comes to be your liege,\
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.\
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.\

\f0\b \cf2 STANLEY\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 STANLEY\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Well,\
Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind\
Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.\
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.\

\f0\b \cf2 STANLEY\

Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,\

If they were his assistants, yea or no;\
Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.\
Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,\
Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.\

That high All-Seer that I dallied with\
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head\

Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men\
To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:\
Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;\
'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,\
Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'\
Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;\
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 RATCLIFF\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night\
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard\
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers\
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.\
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;\
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,\
To see if any mean to shrink from me.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LORDS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Good morrow, Richmond!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 RICHMOND\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,\
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LORDS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 How have you slept, my lord?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 RICHMOND\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams\
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,\
Have I since your departure had, my lords.\
Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,\
Came to my tent, and cried on victory:\
I promise you, my soul is very jocund\
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.\
How far into the morning is it, lords?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 LORDS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Upon the stroke of four.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 RICHMOND\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.\
More than I have said, loving countrymen,\
The leisure and enforcement of the time\
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,\
God and our good cause fight upon our side;\
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,\
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;\
Richard except, those whom we fight against\
Had rather have us win than him they follow:\
For what is he they follow? truly, gentlemen,\
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;\
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;\
One that made means to come by what he hath,\
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;\
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil\
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;\
One that hath ever been God's enemy:\
Then, if you fight against God's enemy,\
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;\
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,\
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;\
If you do fight against your country's foes,\
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;\
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,\
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;\
If you do free your children from the sword,\
Your children's children quit it in your age.\
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,\
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.\
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt\
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;\
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt\
The least of you shall share his part thereof.\
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;\
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 RATCLIFF\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 That he was never trained up in arms.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 RATCLIFF\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 He was in the right; and so indeed it is.\
Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.\
Who saw the sun to-day?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 RATCLIFF\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Not I, my lord.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Then he disdains to shine; for by the book\
He should have braved the east an hour ago\
A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!\

\f0\b \cf2 RATCLIFF\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My lord?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 The sun will not be seen to-day;\
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.\
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.\
Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me\
More than to Richmond? for the selfsame heaven\
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 NORFOLK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.\
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:\
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,\
And thus my battle shall be ordered:\
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,\
Consisting equally of horse and foot;\
Our archers shall be placed in the midst\
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,\
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.\
They thus directed, we will follow\
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side\
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.\
This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 NORFOLK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 A good direction, warlike sovereign.\
This found I on my tent this morning.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III
\f1\b0 \
'Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,\
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'\
A thing devised by the enemy.\
Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge\
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:\
Conscience is but a word that cowards use,\
Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:\
Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.\
March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell\
If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.\
What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?\
Remember whom you are to cope withal;\
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,\
A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,\
Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth\
To desperate ventures and assured destruction.\
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;\
You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,\
They would restrain the one, distain the other.\
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,\
Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?\
A milk-sop, one that never in his life\
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?\
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;\
Lash hence these overweening rags of France,\
These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;\
Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,\
For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:\
If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,\
And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers\
Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,\
And in record, left them the heirs of shame.\
Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives?\
Ravish our daughters?\
Hark! I hear their drum.\
Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yoemen!\
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!\
Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;\
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!\
What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?\

\f0\b MESSENGER\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My lord, he doth deny to come.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Off with his son George's head!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 NORFOLK\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 My lord, the enemy is past the marsh\
After the battle let George Stanley die.\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:\
Advance our standards, set upon our foes\
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,\
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!\
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!\
The king enacts more wonders than a man,\
Daring an opposite to every danger:\
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,\
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.\
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!\

\f0\b \cf2 KING RICHARD III\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,\
And I will stand the hazard of the die:\
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;\
Five have I slain to-day instead of him.\
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.\
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty\
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch\
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:\
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 RICHMOND\

\f0\b \cf2 RICHMOND\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 Inter their bodies as becomes their births:\
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled\
That in submission will return to us:\
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,\
We will unite the white rose and the red:\
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,\
That long have frown'd upon their enmity!\
What traitor hears me, and says not amen?\
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;\
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,\
The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,\
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:\
All this divided York and Lancaster,\
Divided in their dire division,\
O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,\
The true succeeders of each royal house,\
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!\
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.\
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,\
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!\
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,\
That would reduce these bloody days again,\
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!\
Let them not live to taste this land's increase\
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!\
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:\
That she may long live here, God say amen!\
