Lucky us
Thats not our system
This is commercial vessel Nostromo Registration number 180246  Do you read me  Over
Nothing
Its not our system
Report to the mess
Turbulence
Were down
Engine room what happened
I dont see anything  Weve still got pressure
Is that it
Get started on 4 panel  Ill be down in five minutes
Fifteen to twenty hours
Working on it
Yeah
You know the answer to that
Dont worry youll both get whats coming to you
Youre guaranteed by law that youll get a share Now both of you knock it off and get back to work
You ought to be able to handle the rest
If you run into trouble Ill be on the bridge
Hows it going
Have you tried putting the transmission through ECIU
Ill give it a shot
Ash tell Dallas Mother speculates that the noise is some kind of warning
Im going out after them
I still think we should go after them
How many
Dallas Lambert  Can you read me
Okay
Right here
What happened to Kane  I need a clear definition
Weve already broken every rule or quarantine  If we bring an organism on board we wont have a single layer of defense left
I cant  If you were in my position youd do the same
I read you  The answer is negative
Even if its against the law
Lets call it settled
Somebody fill me in
It doesnt make sense  It paralyzes him puts him into a coma then keeps him alive
Whats happening  
What about Kane
Whats the stain on his lungs
Whats happening
Ive got the toughest job on this ship
I have to listen to your bullshit
Ill get off your back when 12 module is fixed
Anything new
Plenty  Whats it mean
Is that why you let it in
While Dallas and Kane are off the ship Im Senior Officer
You also forgot the science divisions basic quarantine law
You just broke it
By breaking quarantine procedure you risk everybodys life
This is your official position as a science officer  Not exactly out of the manual
The door is closed  It must still be in there
Yeah I remember  We cant grab it  We cant kill it
Yeah
Wheres its mouth
Lets get rid of it
That thing bled acid  God knows what itll do when its dead
What about Kane
I need some coffee
How could you leave that kind of decision to him
How does that happen
Since when is that standard procedure
Did you ship out with Ash before
I dont trust him
Theyre pretty much finished now  
There are still some thing left to do
Were blind on B and C decks Reserve power systems blown
Is that a good idea
Lock tractor beams
Retract leading struts
Everything holding together down there
Whenever he says anything you say right  You know that Brett
What do you think Parker  Your staff just follows you around and says right  Like a regular parrot
Yeah  And so will we
Christ
Whats the last thing you can remember
Were on our way home
Whats wrong
That means weve got another one
We cant go into hypersleep with that thing running loose  Wed be sitting ducks in the freezers We have to kill it first
We have to catch it and eject it from the ship
First we have to find it
Ive checked on the supplies For about a week we can stay out of hypersleep
All by yourselves
Theres another problem  How do we find it  Theres no visual communication on B and C decks  All the screens are out
Trap it somehow
I thought Id find you here
Weve got an hourLook I need some relief
Let me tell you something  You keep staring out there long enough theyll be peeling you off the wall
Im tired of talking
Give it a try anyway
Whats it key on
Nothing
Machines screwed up  I cant tell  Needles spinning all over the dial
No just confused  Its coming from below us
Okay
Back this way
I thought you fixed 12 module
Wait
Its within five meters
God damn ithold it
Go get it  Well go on
Nothing here
No  At its present size its   holding enough acid to tear a hole in this ship as big as this room
The only plan thats going to work is the same one we had before  Drive it into an air lock and blow it out into space
The science department should be able to help
Curious isnt itThat the Alien is an encephlepod
Its curious because lower species cant adapt as quickly as higher ones  And this ones doing very well  A real survivor Might even have as good a chance as we do
All right  What about the temperature  What happens if we change it
Thats what worries me
We didnt get him
Ill go
Air lock open
Ready
Read you clear
DallasDallas
Oh my God
This puts me in command
Unless someones got a better idea about dealing with the Alien well continue with the last plan
How are our weapons
Get it
Any ideas  From you or Mother
You mean to tell me with everything weve got were still powerless against the Beast
I cant believe that
Go back to Mother and keep asking questions until you get some better answers
Dallas didnt leave the master computer key with you
No
I know Ash has got the key
He knows I want to check up on himWithout that key weve got no access to command priority information
Did you ever sleep with Ash
No
Cant hear youRepeat
Inner hatch sealed  The outer hatch is open
I dont know  Take over
You tell me
I guess the alarm went off by itself
Nobodys accusing you
Go patch him up
How much oxygen have we lost I want an exact reading
If I could find the command computer key I could prove it
You think Im wrong
Thanks
Lets find out  Wire him back up
Do it
Ash let it on board  Ash let it grow inside Kane  Ash blew the warning signal
Special Order 937
Thats what I want to know
What is Special Order 937
Then theres not point in talking to you  Pull the plug
Why  Why not tell us
They wanted to investigate the Alien  No matter what happened to us
How do we kill it
How
No way
Weve had enough of your help
Nice try Ash
Even if you have contempt for it
Sorry Ash  I dont buy it
He was conning us
He wasnt protecting our human lives and thats all I care about Anyway its done
Hes right about one thing Weve got less than twelve hours oxygen left
Were not there yet
I think we should blow up the ship
We leave in the shuttle and then blow up the ship
Thats all the oxygen
Now  Lets get the food shut off the engines and get out Jones  Wheres Jones
Go look  We dont want to leave him
Ill go  You load up the food
Jones  Youre in luck
Come on Jones
God damn it Jones  Come here
Here kittycome here kitty
What did it do
Ill get you out of there Well get up the autodoc
What can I do
Mother Ive turned all the cooling units back on
I should reach the frontier in another five weeks  With a little luck the network will pick me upThis is Ripley executive officer last survivor of the commercial starship Nostromo signing off Come on cat
