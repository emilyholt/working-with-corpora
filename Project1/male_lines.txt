in sooth i know not why i am so sad:
it wearies me you say it wearies you 
but how i caught it found it or came by it 
what stuff tis made of whereof it is born 
i am to learn 
and such a want-wit sadness makes of me 
that i have much ado to know myself 
your mind is tossing on the ocean 
there where your argosies with portly sail 
like signiors and rich burghers on the flood 
or as it were the pageants of the sea 
do overpeer the petty traffickers 
that curtsy to them do them reverence 
as they fly by them with their woven wings 
believe me sir had i such venture forth 
the better part of my affections would
be with my hopes abroad i should be still
plucking the grass to know where sits the wind 
peering in maps for ports and piers and roads 
and every object that might make me fear
misfortune to my ventures out of doubt
would make me sad 
my wind cooling my broth
would blow me to an ague when i thought
what harm a wind too great at sea might do 
i should not see the sandy hour-glass run 
but i should think of shallows and of flats 
and see my wealthy andrew dock d in sand 
vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
to kiss her burial should i go to church
and see the holy edifice of stone 
and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks 
which touching but my gentle vessel s side 
would scatter all her spices on the stream 
enrobe the roaring waters with my silks 
and in a word but even now worth this 
and now worth nothing shall i have the thought
to think on this and shall i lack the thought
that such a thing bechanced would make me sad 
but tell not me i know antonio
is sad to think upon his merchandise 
believe me no: i thank my fortune for it 
my ventures are not in one bottom trusted 
nor to one place nor is my whole estate
upon the fortune of this present year:
therefore my merchandise makes me not sad 
why then you are in love 
fie fie 
not in love neither then let us say you are sad 
because you are not merry: and twere as easy
for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry 
because you are not sad now by two-headed janus 
nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
some that will evermore peep through their eyes
and laugh like parrots at a bag-piper 
and other of such vinegar aspect
that they ll not show their teeth in way of smile 
though nestor swear the jest be laughable 
here comes bassanio your most noble kinsman 
gratiano and lorenzo fare ye well:
we leave you now with better company 
i would have stay d till i had made you merry 
if worthier friends had not prevented me 
your worth is very dear in my regard 
i take it your own business calls on you
and you embrace the occasion to depart 
good morrow my good lords 
good signiors both when shall we laugh say when 
you grow exceeding strange: must it be so 
we ll make our leisures to attend on yours 
my lord bassanio since you have found antonio 
we two will leave you: but at dinner-time 
i pray you have in mind where we must meet 
i will not fail you 
you look not well signior antonio 
you have too much respect upon the world:
they lose it that do buy it with much care:
believe me you are marvellously changed 
i hold the world but as the world gratiano 
a stage where every man must play a part 
and mine a sad one 
let me play the fool:
with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come 
and let my liver rather heat with wine
than my heart cool with mortifying groans 
why should a man whose blood is warm within 
sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster 
sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
by being peevish i tell thee what antonio 
i love thee and it is my love that speaks 
there are a sort of men whose visages
do cream and mantle like a standing pond 
and do a wilful stillness entertain 
with purpose to be dress d in an opinion
of wisdom gravity profound conceit 
as who should say i am sir oracle 
and when i ope my lips let no dog bark 
o my antonio i do know of these
that therefore only are reputed wise
for saying nothing when i am very sure 
if they should speak would almost damn those ears 
which hearing them would call their brothers fools 
i ll tell thee more of this another time:
but fish not with this melancholy bait 
for this fool gudgeon this opinion 
come good lorenzo fare ye well awhile:
i ll end my exhortation after dinner 
well we will leave you then till dinner-time:
i must be one of these same dumb wise men 
for gratiano never lets me speak 
well keep me company but two years moe 
thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue 
farewell: i ll grow a talker for this gear 
thanks i faith for silence is only commendable
in a neat s tongue dried and a maid not vendible 
is that any thing now 
gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more
than any man in all venice his reasons are as two
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
shall seek all day ere you find them and when you
have them they are not worth the search 
well tell me now what lady is the same
to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage 
that you to-day promised to tell me of 
tis not unknown to you antonio 
how much i have disabled mine estate 
by something showing a more swelling port
than my faint means would grant continuance:
nor do i now make moan to be abridged
from such a noble rate but my chief care
is to come fairly off from the great debts
wherein my time something too prodigal
hath left me gaged to you antonio 
i owe the most in money and in love 
and from your love i have a warranty
to unburden all my plots and purposes
how to get clear of all the debts i owe 
i pray you good bassanio let me know it 
and if it stand as you yourself still do 
within the eye of honour be assured 
my purse my person my extremest means 
lie all unlock d to your occasions 
in my school-days when i had lost one shaft 
i shot his fellow of the self-same flight
the self-same way with more advised watch 
to find the other forth and by adventuring both
i oft found both: i urge this childhood proof 
because what follows is pure innocence 
i owe you much and like a wilful youth 
that which i owe is lost but if you please
to shoot another arrow that self way
which you did shoot the first i do not doubt 
as i will watch the aim or to find both
or bring your latter hazard back again
and thankfully rest debtor for the first 
you know me well and herein spend but time
to wind about my love with circumstance 
and out of doubt you do me now more wrong
in making question of my uttermost
than if you had made waste of all i have:
then do but say to me what i should do
that in your knowledge may by me be done 
and i am prest unto it: therefore speak 
in belmont is a lady richly left 
and she is fair and fairer than that word 
of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
i did receive fair speechless messages:
her name is portia nothing undervalued
to cato s daughter brutus portia:
nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth 
for the four winds blow in from every coast
renowned suitors and her sunny locks
hang on her temples like a golden fleece 
which makes her seat of belmont colchos strand 
and many jasons come in quest of her 
o my antonio had i but the means
to hold a rival place with one of them 
i have a mind presages me such thrift 
that i should questionless be fortunate 
thou know st that all my fortunes are at sea 
neither have i money nor commodity
to raise a present sum: therefore go forth 
try what my credit can in venice do:
that shall be rack d even to the uttermost 
to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia 
go presently inquire and so will i 
where money is and i no question make
to have it of my trust or for my sake 
three thousand ducats well 
ay sir for three months 
for three months well 
for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound 
antonio shall become bound well 
may you stead me will you pleasure me shall i
know your answer 
three thousand ducats for three months and antonio bound 
your answer to that 
antonio is a good man 
have you heard any imputation to the contrary 
oh no no no no: my meaning in saying he is a
good man is to have you understand me that he is
sufficient yet his means are in supposition: he
hath an argosy bound to tripolis another to the
indies i understand moreover upon the rialto he
hath a third at mexico a fourth for england and
other ventures he hath squandered abroad but ships
are but boards sailors but men: there be land-rats
and water-rats water-thieves and land-thieves i
mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters 
winds and rocks the man is notwithstanding 
sufficient three thousand ducats i think i may
take his bond 
be assured you may 
i will be assured i may and that i may be assured 
i will bethink me may i speak with antonio 
if it please you to dine with us 
yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which
your prophet the nazarite conjured the devil into i
will buy with you sell with you talk with you 
walk with you and so following but i will not eat
with you drink with you nor pray with you what
news on the rialto who is he comes here 
this is signior antonio 
[aside] how like a fawning publican he looks 
i hate him for he is a christian 
but more for that in low simplicity
he lends out money gratis and brings down
the rate of usance here with us in venice 
if i can catch him once upon the hip 
i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him 
he hates our sacred nation and he rails 
even there where merchants most do congregate 
on me my bargains and my well-won thrift 
which he calls interest cursed be my tribe 
if i forgive him 
shylock do you hear 
i am debating of my present store 
and by the near guess of my memory 
i cannot instantly raise up the gross
of full three thousand ducats what of that 
tubal a wealthy hebrew of my tribe 
will furnish me but soft how many months
do you desire 
rest you fair good signior 
your worship was the last man in our mouths 
shylock although i neither lend nor borrow
by taking nor by giving of excess 
yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend 
i ll break a custom is he yet possess d
how much ye would 
ay ay three thousand ducats 
and for three months 
i had forgot three months you told me so 
well then your bond and let me see but hear you 
methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
upon advantage 
i do never use it 
when jacob grazed his uncle laban s sheep 
this jacob from our holy abram was 
as his wise mother wrought in his behalf 
the third possessor ay he was the third 
and what of him did he take interest 
no not take interest not as you would say 
directly interest: mark what jacob did 
when laban and himself were compromised
that all the eanlings which were streak d and pied
should fall as jacob s hire the ewes being rank 
in the end of autumn turned to the rams 
and when the work of generation was
between these woolly breeders in the act 
the skilful shepherd peel d me certain wands 
and in the doing of the deed of kind 
he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes 
who then conceiving did in eaning time
fall parti-colour d lambs and those were jacob s 
this was a way to thrive and he was blest:
and thrift is blessing if men steal it not 
this was a venture sir that jacob served for 
a thing not in his power to bring to pass 
but sway d and fashion d by the hand of heaven 
was this inserted to make interest good 
or is your gold and silver ewes and rams 
i cannot tell i make it breed as fast:
but note me signior 
mark you this bassanio 
the devil can cite scripture for his purpose 
an evil soul producing holy witness
is like a villain with a smiling cheek 
a goodly apple rotten at the heart:
o what a goodly outside falsehood hath 
three thousand ducats tis a good round sum 
three months from twelve then let me see the rate 
well shylock shall we be beholding to you 
signior antonio many a time and oft
in the rialto you have rated me
about my moneys and my usances:
still have i borne it with a patient shrug 
for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe 
you call me misbeliever cut-throat dog 
and spit upon my jewish gaberdine 
and all for use of that which is mine own 
well then it now appears you need my help:
go to then you come to me and you say
shylock we would have moneys: you say so 
you that did void your rheum upon my beard
and foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
over your threshold: moneys is your suit
what should i say to you should i not say
hath a dog money is it possible
a cur can lend three thousand ducats or
shall i bend low and in a bondman s key 
with bated breath and whispering humbleness say this 
fair sir you spit on me on wednesday last 
you spurn d me such a day another time
you call d me dog and for these courtesies
i ll lend you thus much moneys 
i am as like to call thee so again 
to spit on thee again to spurn thee too 
if thou wilt lend this money lend it not
as to thy friends for when did friendship take
a breed for barren metal of his friend 
but lend it rather to thine enemy 
who if he break thou mayst with better face
exact the penalty 
why look you how you storm 
i would be friends with you and have your love 
forget the shames that you have stain d me with 
supply your present wants and take no doit
of usance for my moneys and you ll not hear me:
this is kind i offer 
this were kindness 
this kindness will i show 
go with me to a notary seal me there
your single bond and in a merry sport 
if you repay me not on such a day 
in such a place such sum or sums as are
express d in the condition let the forfeit
be nominated for an equal pound
of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken
in what part of your body pleaseth me 
content i faith: i ll seal to such a bond
and say there is much kindness in the jew 
you shall not seal to such a bond for me:
i ll rather dwell in my necessity 
why fear not man i will not forfeit it:
within these two months that s a month before
this bond expires i do expect return
of thrice three times the value of this bond 
o father abram what these christians are 
whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
the thoughts of others pray you tell me this 
if he should break his day what should i gain
by the exaction of the forfeiture 
a pound of man s flesh taken from a man
is not so estimable profitable neither 
as flesh of muttons beefs or goats i say 
to buy his favour i extend this friendship:
if he will take it so if not adieu 
and for my love i pray you wrong me not 
yes shylock i will seal unto this bond 
then meet me forthwith at the notary s 
give him direction for this merry bond 
and i will go and purse the ducats straight 
see to my house left in the fearful guard
of an unthrifty knave and presently
i will be with you 
hie thee gentle jew 
the hebrew will turn christian: he grows kind 
i like not fair terms and a villain s mind 
come on: in this there can be no dismay 
my ships come home a month before the day 
mislike me not for my complexion 
the shadow d livery of the burnish d sun 
to whom i am a neighbour and near bred 
bring me the fairest creature northward born 
where phoebus fire scarce thaws the icicles 
and let us make incision for your love 
to prove whose blood is reddest his or mine 
i tell thee lady this aspect of mine
hath fear d the valiant: by my love i swear
the best-regarded virgins of our clime
have loved it too: i would not change this hue 
except to steal your thoughts my gentle queen 
even for that i thank you:
therefore i pray you lead me to the caskets
to try my fortune by this scimitar
that slew the sophy and a persian prince
that won three fields of sultan solyman 
i would outstare the sternest eyes that look 
outbrave the heart most daring on the earth 
pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear 
yea mock the lion when he roars for prey 
to win thee lady but alas the while 
if hercules and lichas play at dice
which is the better man the greater throw
may turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
so is alcides beaten by his page 
and so may i blind fortune leading me 
miss that which one unworthier may attain 
and die with grieving 
nor will not come bring me unto my chance 
good fortune then 
to make me blest or cursed st among men 
certainly my conscience will serve me to run from
this jew my master the fiend is at mine elbow and
tempts me saying to me gobbo launcelot gobbo good
launcelot or good gobbo or good launcelot
gobbo use your legs take the start run away my
conscience says no take heed honest launcelot 
take heed honest gobbo or as aforesaid honest
launcelot gobbo do not run scorn running with thy
heels well the most courageous fiend bids me
pack: via says the fiend away says the
fiend for the heavens rouse up a brave mind 
says the fiend and run well my conscience 
hanging about the neck of my heart says very wisely
to me my honest friend launcelot being an honest
man s son or rather an honest woman s son for 
indeed my father did something smack something
grow to he had a kind of taste well my conscience
says launcelot budge not budge says the
fiend budge not says my conscience 
conscience say i you counsel well fiend 
say i you counsel well: to be ruled by my
conscience i should stay with the jew my master 
who god bless the mark is a kind of devil and to
run away from the jew i should be ruled by the
fiend who saving your reverence is the devil
himself certainly the jew is the very devil
incarnal and in my conscience my conscience is
but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel
me to stay with the jew the fiend gives the more
friendly counsel: i will run fiend my heels are
at your command i will run 
master young man you i pray you which is the way
to master jew s 
o heavens this is my true-begotten father 
who being more than sand-blind high-gravel blind 
knows me not: i will try confusions with him 
master young gentleman i pray you which is the way
to master jew s 
turn up on your right hand at the next turning but 
at the next turning of all on your left marry at
the very next turning turn of no hand but turn
down indirectly to the jew s house 
by god s sonties twill be a hard way to hit can
you tell me whether one launcelot 
that dwells with him dwell with him or no 
talk you of young master launcelot 
mark me now now will i raise the waters talk you
of young master launcelot 
no master sir but a poor man s son: his father 
though i say it is an honest exceeding poor man
and god be thanked well to live 
well let his father be what a will we talk of
young master launcelot 
your worship s friend and launcelot sir 
but i pray you ergo old man ergo i beseech you 
talk you of young master launcelot 
of launcelot an t please your mastership 
ergo master launcelot talk not of master
launcelot father for the young gentleman 
according to fates and destinies and such odd
sayings the sisters three and such branches of
learning is indeed deceased or as you would say
in plain terms gone to heaven 
marry god forbid the boy was the very staff of my
age my very prop 
do i look like a cudgel or a hovel-post a staff or
a prop do you know me father 
alack the day i know you not young gentleman:
but i pray you tell me is my boy god rest his
soul alive or dead 
do you not know me father 
alack sir i am sand-blind i know you not 
nay indeed if you had your eyes you might fail of
the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his
own child well old man i will tell you news of
your son: give me your blessing: truth will come
to light murder cannot be hid long a man s son
may but at the length truth will out 
pray you sir stand up: i am sure you are not
launcelot my boy 
pray you let s have no more fooling about it but
give me your blessing: i am launcelot your boy
that was your son that is your child that shall
be 
i cannot think you are my son 
i know not what i shall think of that: but i am
launcelot the jew s man and i am sure margery your
wife is my mother 
her name is margery indeed: i ll be sworn if thou
be launcelot thou art mine own flesh and blood 
lord worshipped might he be what a beard hast thou
got thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail 
it should seem then that dobbin s tail grows
backward: i am sure he had more hair of his tail
than i have of my face when i last saw him 
lord how art thou changed how dost thou and thy
master agree i have brought him a present how
gree you now 
well well: but for mine own part as i have set
up my rest to run away so i will not rest till i
have run some ground my master s a very jew: give
him a present give him a halter: i am famished in
his service you may tell every finger i have with
my ribs father i am glad you are come: give me
your present to one master bassanio who indeed 
gives rare new liveries: if i serve not him i
will run as far as god has any ground o rare
fortune here comes the man: to him father for i
am a jew if i serve the jew any longer 
you may do so but let it be so hasted that supper
be ready at the farthest by five of the clock see

and desire gratiano to come anon to my lodging 
to him father 
god bless your worship 
gramercy wouldst thou aught with me 
here s my son sir a poor boy 
not a poor boy sir but the rich jew s man that
would sir as my father shall specify 
he hath a great infection sir as one would say to serve 
indeed the short and the long is i serve the jew 
and have a desire as my father shall specify 
his master and he saving your worship s reverence 
are scarce cater-cousins 
to be brief the very truth is that the jew having
done me wrong doth cause me as my father being i
hope an old man shall frutify unto you 
i have here a dish of doves that i would bestow upon
your worship and my suit is 
in very brief the suit is impertinent to myself as
your worship shall know by this honest old man and 
though i say it though old man yet poor man my father 
one speak for both what would you 
serve you sir 
that is the very defect of the matter sir 
i know thee well thou hast obtain d thy suit:
shylock thy master spoke with me this day 
and hath preferr d thee if it be preferment
to leave a rich jew s service to become
the follower of so poor a gentleman 
the old proverb is very well parted between my
master shylock and you sir: you have the grace of
god sir and he hath enough 
thou speak st it well go father with thy son 
take leave of thy old master and inquire
my lodging out give him a livery
more guarded than his fellows : see it done 
father in i cannot get a service no i have
ne er a tongue in my head well if any man in
italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
upon a book i shall have good fortune go to 
here s a simple line of life: here s a small trifle
of wives: alas fifteen wives is nothing eleven
widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
man: and then to scape drowning thrice and to be
in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed 
here are simple scapes well if fortune be a
woman she s a good wench for this gear father 
come i ll take my leave of the jew in the twinkling of an eye 
i pray thee good leonardo think on this:
these things being bought and orderly bestow d 
return in haste for i do feast to-night
my best-esteem d acquaintance: hie thee go 
leonardo
my best endeavours shall be done herein 
where is your master

you have obtain d it 
you must not deny me: i must go with you to belmont 
why then you must but hear thee gratiano 
thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice 
parts that become thee happily enough
and in such eyes as ours appear not faults 
but where thou art not known why there they show
something too liberal pray thee take pain
to allay with some cold drops of modesty
thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behavior
i be misconstrued in the place i go to 
and lose my hopes 
signior bassanio hear me:
if i do not put on a sober habit 
talk with respect and swear but now and then 
wear prayer-books in my pocket look demurely 
nay more while grace is saying hood mine eyes
thus with my hat and sigh and say amen 
use all the observance of civility 
like one well studied in a sad ostent
to please his grandam never trust me more 
well we shall see your bearing 
nay but i bar to-night: you shall not gauge me
by what we do to-night

i would entreat you rather to put on
your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends
that purpose merriment but fare you well:
i have some business 
and i must to lorenzo and the rest:
but we will visit you at supper-time 
adieu tears exhibit my tongue most beautiful
pagan most sweet jew if a christian did not play

adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my
manly spirit: adieu 
nay we will slink away in supper-time 
disguise us at my lodging and return 
all in an hour 
we have not made good preparation 
we have not spoke us yet of torchbearers 
tis vile unless it may be quaintly order d 
and better in my mind not undertook 
tis now but four o clock: we have two hours
to furnish us 
friend launcelot what s the news 
an it shall please you to break up
this it shall seem to signify 
i know the hand: in faith tis a fair hand 
and whiter than the paper it writ on
is the fair hand that writ 
love-news in faith 
by your leave sir 
whither goest thou 
marry sir to bid my old master the
jew to sup to-night with my new master the christian 
hold here take this: tell gentle jessica

what gold and jewels she is furnish d with 
what page s suit she hath in readiness 
if e er the jew her father come to heaven

and never dare misfortune cross her foot 
unless she do it under this excuse 
that she is issue to a faithless jew 
come go with me peruse this as thou goest:
fair jessica shall be my torch-beare r 
well thou shalt see thy eyes shall be thy judge 
the difference of old shylock and bassanio: 
what jessica thou shalt not gormandise 
as thou hast done with me: what jessica 
and sleep and snore and rend apparel out 
why jessica i say 
why jessica 
who bids thee call i do not bid thee call 
your worship was wont to tell me that
i could do nothing without bidding 
i am bid forth to supper jessica:
there are my keys but wherefore should i go 
i am not bid for love they flatter me:
but yet i ll go in hate to feed upon
the prodigal christian jessica my girl 
look to my house i am right loath to go:
there is some ill a-brewing towards my rest 
for i did dream of money-bags to-night 
i beseech you sir go: my young master doth expect
your reproach 
so do i his 
an they have conspired together i will not say you
shall see a masque but if you do then it was not
for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
black-monday last at six o clock i the morning 
falling out that year on ash-wednesday was four
year in the afternoon 
what are there masques hear you me jessica:
lock up my doors and when you hear the drum
and the vile squealing of the wry-neck d fife 
clamber not you up to the casements then 
nor thrust your head into the public street
to gaze on christian fools with varnish d faces 
but stop my house s ears i mean my casements:
let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
my sober house by jacob s staff i swear 
i have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
but i will go go you before me sirrah 
say i will come 
i will go before sir mistress look out at
window for all this there will come a christian
boy will be worth a jewess eye 
what says that fool of hagar s offspring ha 
the patch is kind enough but a huge feeder 
snail-slow in profit and he sleeps by day
more than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me 
therefore i part with him and part with him
to one that would have him help to waste
his borrow d purse well jessica go in 
perhaps i will return immediately:
do as i bid you shut doors after you:
fast bind fast find 
a proverb never stale in thrifty mind 
this is the pent-house under which lorenzo
desired us to make stand 
his hour is almost past 
and it is marvel he out-dwells his hour 
for lovers ever run before the clock 
o ten times faster venus pigeons fly
to seal love s bonds new-made than they are wont
to keep obliged faith unforfeited 
that ever holds: who riseth from a feast
with that keen appetite that he sits down 
where is the horse that doth untread again
his tedious measures with the unbated fire
that he did pace them first all things that are 
are with more spirit chased than enjoy d 
how like a younker or a prodigal
the scarfed bark puts from her native bay 
hugg d and embraced by the strumpet wind 
how like the prodigal doth she return 
with over-weather d ribs and ragged sails 
lean rent and beggar d by the strumpet wind 
here comes lorenzo: more of this hereafter 
sweet friends your patience for my long abode 
not i but my affairs have made you wait:
when you shall please to play the thieves for wives 
i ll watch as long for you then approach 
here dwells my father jew ho who s within 
lorenzo and thy love 
heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art 
descend for you must be my torchbearer 
so are you sweet 
even in the lovely garnish of a boy 
but come at once 
for the close night doth play the runaway 
and we are stay d for at bassanio s feast 
now by my hood a gentile and no jew 
beshrew me but i love her heartily 
for she is wise if i can judge of her 
and fair she is if that mine eyes be true 
and true she is as she hath proved herself 
and therefore like herself wise fair and true 
shall she be placed in my constant soul 
what art thou come on gentlemen away 
our masquing mates by this time for us stay 
who s there 
signior antonio 
fie fie gratiano where are all the rest 
tis nine o clock: our friends all stay for you 
no masque to-night: the wind is come about 
bassanio presently will go aboard:
i have sent twenty out to seek for you 
i am glad on t: i desire no more delight
than to be under sail and gone to-night 
the first of gold who this inscription bears 
who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire 
the second silver which this promise carries 
who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves 
this third dull lead with warning all as blunt 
who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath 
how shall i know if i do choose the right 
some god direct my judgment let me see 
i will survey the inscriptions back again 
what says this leaden casket 
who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath 
must give: for what for lead hazard for lead 
this casket threatens men that hazard all
do it in hope of fair advantages:
a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross 
i ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead 
what says the silver with her virgin hue 
who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves 
as much as he deserves pause there morocco 
and weigh thy value with an even hand:
if thou be st rated by thy estimation 
thou dost deserve enough and yet enough
may not extend so far as to the lady:
and yet to be afeard of my deserving
were but a weak disabling of myself 
as much as i deserve why that s the lady:
i do in birth deserve her and in fortunes 
in graces and in qualities of breeding 
but more than these in love i do deserve 
what if i stray d no further but chose here 
let s see once more this saying graved in gold
who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire 
why that s the lady all the world desires her 
from the four corners of the earth they come 
to kiss this shrine this mortal-breathing saint:
the hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
of wide arabia are as thoroughfares now
for princes to come view fair portia:
the watery kingdom whose ambitious head
spits in the face of heaven is no bar
to stop the foreign spirits but they come 
as o er a brook to see fair portia 
one of these three contains her heavenly picture 
is t like that lead contains her twere damnation
to think so base a thought: it were too gross
to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave 
or shall i think in silver she s immured 
being ten times undervalued to tried gold 
o sinful thought never so rich a gem
was set in worse than gold they have in england
a coin that bears the figure of an angel
stamped in gold but that s insculp d upon 
but here an angel in a golden bed
lies all within deliver me the key:
here do i choose and thrive i as i may 
o hell what have we here 
a carrion death within whose empty eye
there is a written scroll i ll read the writing 
all that glitters is not gold 
often have you heard that told:
many a man his life hath sold
but my outside to behold:
gilded tombs do worms enfold 
had you been as wise as bold 
young in limbs in judgment old 
your answer had not been inscroll d:
fare you well your suit is cold 
cold indeed and labour lost:
then farewell heat and welcome frost 
portia adieu i have too grieved a heart
to take a tedious leave: thus losers part 
why man i saw bassanio under sail:
with him is gratiano gone along 
and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not 
the villain jew with outcries raised the duke 
who went with him to search bassanio s ship 
he came too late the ship was under sail:
but there the duke was given to understand
that in a gondola were seen together
lorenzo and his amorous jessica:
besides antonio certified the duke
they were not with bassanio in his ship 
i never heard a passion so confused 
so strange outrageous and so variable 
as the dog jew did utter in the streets:
my daughter o my ducats o my daughter 
fled with a christian o my christian ducats 
justice the law my ducats and my daughter 
a sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats 
of double ducats stolen from me by my daughter 
and jewels two stones two rich and precious stones 
stolen by my daughter justice find the girl 
she hath the stones upon her and the ducats 
why all the boys in venice follow him 
crying his stones his daughter and his ducats 
let good antonio look he keep his day 
or he shall pay for this 
marry well remember d 
i reason d with a frenchman yesterday 
who told me in the narrow seas that part
the french and english there miscarried
a vessel of our country richly fraught:
i thought upon antonio when he told me 
and wish d in silence that it were not his 
you were best to tell antonio what you hear 
yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him 
a kinder gentleman treads not the earth 
i saw bassanio and antonio part:
bassanio told him he would make some speed
of his return: he answer d do not so 
slubber not business for my sake bassanio
but stay the very riping of the time 
and for the jew s bond which he hath of me 
let it not enter in your mind of love:
be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts
to courtship and such fair ostents of love
as shall conveniently become you there: 
and even there his eye being big with tears 
turning his face he put his hand behind him 
and with affection wondrous sensible
he wrung bassanio s hand and so they parted 
i think he only loves the world for him 
i pray thee let us go and find him out
and quicken his embraced heaviness
with some delight or other 
do we so 
i am enjoin d by oath to observe three things:
first never to unfold to any one
which casket twas i chose next if i fail
of the right casket never in my life
to woo a maid in way of marriage: lastly 
if i do fail in fortune of my choice 
immediately to leave you and be gone 
and so have i address d me fortune now
to my heart s hope gold silver and base lead 
who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath 
you shall look fairer ere i give or hazard 
what says the golden chest ha let me see:
who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire 
what many men desire that many may be meant
by the fool multitude that choose by show 
not learning more than the fond eye doth teach 
which pries not to the interior but like the martlet 
builds in the weather on the outward wall 
even in the force and road of casualty 
i will not choose what many men desire 
because i will not jump with common spirits
and rank me with the barbarous multitudes 
why then to thee thou silver treasure-house 
tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves: 
and well said too for who shall go about
to cozen fortune and be honourable
without the stamp of merit let none presume
to wear an undeserved dignity 
o that estates degrees and offices
were not derived corruptly and that clear honour
were purchased by the merit of the wearer 
how many then should cover that stand bare 
how many be commanded that command 
how much low peasantry would then be glean d
from the true seed of honour and how much honour
pick d from the chaff and ruin of the times
to be new-varnish d well but to my choice:
who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves 
i will assume desert give me a key for this 
and instantly unlock my fortunes here 
what s here the portrait of a blinking idiot 
presenting me a schedule i will read it 
how much unlike art thou to portia 
how much unlike my hopes and my deservings 
who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves 
did i deserve no more than a fool s head 
is that my prize are my deserts no better 
what is here 
the fire seven times tried this:
seven times tried that judgment is 
that did never choose amiss 
some there be that shadows kiss 
such have but a shadow s bliss:
there be fools alive i wis 
silver d o er and so was this 
take what wife you will to bed 
i will ever be your head:
so be gone: you are sped 
still more fool i shall appear
by the time i linger here
with one fool s head i came to woo 
but i go away with two 
sweet adieu i ll keep my oath 
patiently to bear my wroth 
now what news on the rialto 
why yet it lives there uncheck d that antonio hath
a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas 
the goodwins i think they call the place a very
dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many
a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip
report be an honest woman of her word 
i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
wept for the death of a third husband but it is
true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
plain highway of talk that the good antonio the
honest antonio o that i had a title good enough
to keep his name company 
come the full stop 
ha what sayest thou why the end is he hath
lost a ship 
i would it might prove the end of his losses 
let me say amen betimes lest the devil cross my
prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a jew 
how now shylock what news among the merchants 
you know none so well none so well as you of my
daughter s flight 
that s certain: i for my part knew the tailor
that made the wings she flew withal 
and shylock for his own part knew the bird was
fledged and then it is the complexion of them all
to leave the dam 
she is damned for it 
that s certain if the devil may be her judge 
my own flesh and blood to rebel 
out upon it old carrion rebels it at these years 
i say my daughter is my flesh and blood 
there is more difference between thy flesh and hers
than between jet and ivory more between your bloods
than there is between red wine and rhenish but
tell us do you hear whether antonio have had any
loss at sea or no 
there i have another bad match: a bankrupt a
prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the
rialto a beggar that was used to come so smug upon
the mart let him look to his bond: he was wont to
call me usurer let him look to his bond: he was
wont to lend money for a christian courtesy let him
look to his bond 
why i am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take
his flesh: what s that good for 
to bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else 
it will feed my revenge he hath disgraced me and
hindered me half a million laughed at my losses 
mocked at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my
bargains cooled my friends heated mine
enemies and what s his reason i am a jew hath
not a jew eyes hath not a jew hands organs 
dimensions senses affections passions fed with
the same food hurt with the same weapons subject
to the same diseases healed by the same means 
warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as
a christian is if you prick us do we not bleed 
if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison
us do we not die and if you wrong us shall we not
revenge if we are like you in the rest we will
resemble you in that if a jew wrong a christian 
what is his humility revenge if a christian
wrong a jew what should his sufferance be by
christian example why revenge the villany you
teach me i will execute and it shall go hard but i
will better the instruction 
gentlemen my master antonio is at his house and
desires to speak with you both 
we have been up and down to seek him 
here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be
matched unless the devil himself turn jew 
how now tubal what news from genoa hast thou
found my daughter 
i often came where i did hear of her but cannot find her 
why there there there there a diamond gone 
cost me two thousand ducats in frankfort the curse
never fell upon our nation till now i never felt it
till now: two thousand ducats in that and other
precious precious jewels i would my daughter
were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear 
would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in
her coffin no news of them why so: and i know
not what s spent in the search: why thou loss upon
loss the thief gone with so much and so much to
find the thief and no satisfaction no revenge:
nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
shoulders no sighs but of my breathing no tears
but of my shedding 
yes other men have ill luck too: antonio as i
heard in genoa 
what what what ill luck ill luck 
hath an argosy cast away coming from tripolis 
i thank god i thank god is t true is t true 
i spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck 
i thank thee good tubal: good news good news 
ha ha where in genoa 
your daughter spent in genoa as i heard in one
night fourscore ducats 
thou stickest a dagger in me: i shall never see my
gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting 
fourscore ducats 
there came divers of antonio s creditors in my
company to venice that swear he cannot choose but break 
i am very glad of it: i ll plague him i ll torture
him: i am glad of it 
one of them showed me a ring that he had of your
daughter for a monkey 
out upon her thou torturest me tubal: it was my
turquoise i had it of leah when i was a bachelor:
i would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys 
but antonio is certainly undone 
nay that s true that s very true go tubal fee
me an officer bespeak him a fortnight before i
will have the heart of him if he forfeit for were
he out of venice i can make what merchandise i
will go go tubal and meet me at our synagogue 
go good tubal at our synagogue tubal 
let me choose
for as i am i live upon the rack 
none but that ugly treason of mistrust 
which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
there may as well be amity and life
tween snow and fire as treason and my love 
promise me life and i ll confess the truth 
confess and love 
had been the very sum of my confession:
o happy torment when my torturer
doth teach me answers for deliverance 
but let me to my fortune and the caskets 
so may the outward shows be least themselves:
the world is still deceived with ornament 
in law what plea so tainted and corrupt 
but being seasoned with a gracious voice 
obscures the show of evil in religion 
what damned error but some sober brow
will bless it and approve it with a text 
hiding the grossness with fair ornament 
there is no vice so simple but assumes
some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
how many cowards whose hearts are all as false
as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins
the beards of hercules and frowning mars 
who inward search d have livers white as milk 
and these assume but valour s excrement
to render them redoubted look on beauty 
and you shall see tis purchased by the weight 
which therein works a miracle in nature 
making them lightest that wear most of it:
so are those crisped snaky golden locks
which make such wanton gambols with the wind 
upon supposed fairness often known
to be the dowry of a second head 
the skull that bred them in the sepulchre 
thus ornament is but the guiled shore
to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf
veiling an indian beauty in a word 
the seeming truth which cunning times put on
to entrap the wisest therefore thou gaudy gold 
hard food for midas i will none of thee 
nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
tween man and man: but thou thou meagre lead 
which rather threatenest than dost promise aught 
thy paleness moves me more than eloquence 
and here choose i joy be the consequence 
what find i here 
fair portia s counterfeit what demi-god
hath come so near creation move these eyes 
or whether riding on the balls of mine 
seem they in motion here are sever d lips 
parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
should sunder such sweet friends here in her hairs
the painter plays the spider and hath woven
a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men 
faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes 
how could he see to do them having made one 
methinks it should have power to steal both his
and leave itself unfurnish d yet look how far
the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
in underprizing it so far this shadow
doth limp behind the substance here s the scroll 
the continent and summary of my fortune 
you that choose not by the view 
chance as fair and choose as true 
since this fortune falls to you 
be content and seek no new 
if you be well pleased with this
and hold your fortune for your bliss 
turn you where your lady is
and claim her with a loving kiss 
a gentle scroll fair lady by your leave 
i come by note to give and to receive 
like one of two contending in a prize 
that thinks he hath done well in people s eyes 
hearing applause and universal shout 
giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt
whether these pearls of praise be his or no 
so thrice fair lady stand i even so 
as doubtful whether what i see be true 
until confirm d sign d ratified by you 
madam you have bereft me of all words 
only my blood speaks to you in my veins 
and there is such confusion in my powers 
as after some oration fairly spoke
by a beloved prince there doth appear
among the buzzing pleased multitude 
where every something being blent together 
turns to a wild of nothing save of joy 
express d and not express d but when this ring
parts from this finger then parts life from hence:
o then be bold to say bassanio s dead 
my lord bassanio and my gentle lady 
i wish you all the joy that you can wish 
for i am sure you can wish none from me:
and when your honours mean to solemnize
the bargain of your faith i do beseech you 
even at that time i may be married too 
with all my heart so thou canst get a wife 
i thank your lordship you have got me one 
my eyes my lord can look as swift as yours:
you saw the mistress i beheld the maid 
you loved i loved for intermission 
no more pertains to me my lord than you 
your fortune stood upon the casket there 
and so did mine too as the matter falls 
for wooing here until i sweat again 
and sweating until my very roof was dry
with oaths of love at last if promise last 
i got a promise of this fair one here
to have her love provided that your fortune
achieved her mistress 
and do you gratiano mean good faith 
yes faith my lord 
our feast shall be much honour d in your marriage 
we ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats 
no we shall ne er win at that sport and stake down 
but who comes here lorenzo and his infidel what 
and my old venetian friend salerio 
lorenzo and salerio welcome hither 
if that the youth of my new interest here
have power to bid you welcome by your leave 
i bid my very friends and countrymen 
sweet portia welcome 
i thank your honour for my part my lord 
my purpose was not to have seen you here 
but meeting with salerio by the way 
he did entreat me past all saying nay 
to come with him along 
salerio
i did my lord 
and i have reason for it signior antonio
commends him to you 
ere i ope his letter 
i pray you tell me how my good friend doth 
salerio
not sick my lord unless it be in mind 
nor well unless in mind: his letter there
will show you his estate 
nerissa cheer yon stranger bid her welcome 
your hand salerio: what s the news from venice 
how doth that royal merchant good antonio 
i know he will be glad of our success 
we are the jasons we have won the fleece 
salerio
i would you had won the fleece that he hath lost 
o sweet portia 
here are a few of the unpleasant st words
that ever blotted paper gentle lady 
when i did first impart my love to you 
i freely told you all the wealth i had
ran in my veins i was a gentleman 
and then i told you true: and yet dear lady 
rating myself at nothing you shall see
how much i was a braggart when i told you
my state was nothing i should then have told you
that i was worse than nothing for indeed 
i have engaged myself to a dear friend 
engaged my friend to his mere enemy 
to feed my means here is a letter lady 
the paper as the body of my friend 
and every word in it a gaping wound 
issuing life-blood but is it true salerio 
have all his ventures fail d what not one hit 
from tripolis from mexico and england 
from lisbon barbary and india 
and not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
of merchant-marring rocks 
salerio
not one my lord 
besides it should appear that if he had
the present money to discharge the jew 
he would not take it never did i know
a creature that did bear the shape of man 
so keen and greedy to confound a man:
he plies the duke at morning and at night 
and doth impeach the freedom of the state 
if they deny him justice: twenty merchants 
the duke himself and the magnificoes
of greatest port have all persuaded with him 
but none can drive him from the envious plea
of forfeiture of justice and his bond 
the dearest friend to me the kindest man 
the best-condition d and unwearied spirit
in doing courtesies and one in whom
the ancient roman honour more appears
than any that draws breath in italy 
for me three thousand ducats 
[reads] sweet bassanio my ships have all
miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is
very low my bond to the jew is forfeit and since
in paying it it is impossible i should live all
debts are cleared between you and i if i might but
see you at my death notwithstanding use your
pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come 
let not my letter 
since i have your good leave to go away 
i will make haste: but till i come again 
no bed shall e er be guilty of my stay 
no rest be interposer twixt us twain 
gaoler look to him: tell not me of mercy 
this is the fool that lent out money gratis:
gaoler look to him 
hear me yet good shylock 
i ll have my bond speak not against my bond:
i have sworn an oath that i will have my bond 
thou call dst me dog before thou hadst a cause 
but since i am a dog beware my fangs:
the duke shall grant me justice i do wonder 
thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond
to come abroad with him at his request 
i pray thee hear me speak 
i ll have my bond i will not hear thee speak:
i ll have my bond and therefore speak no more 
i ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool 
to shake the head relent and sigh and yield
to christian intercessors follow not 
i ll have no speaking: i will have my bond 
it is the most impenetrable cur
that ever kept with men 
let him alone:
i ll follow him no more with bootless prayers 
he seeks my life his reason well i know:
i oft deliver d from his forfeitures
many that have at times made moan to me 
therefore he hates me 
i am sure the duke
will never grant this forfeiture to hold 
the duke cannot deny the course of law:
for the commodity that strangers have
with us in venice if it be denied 
will much impeach the justice of his state 
since that the trade and profit of the city
consisteth of all nations therefore go:
these griefs and losses have so bated me 
that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
to-morrow to my bloody creditor 
well gaoler on pray god bassanio come
to see me pay his debt and then i care not 
madam although i speak it in your presence 
you have a noble and a true conceit
of godlike amity which appears most strongly
in bearing thus the absence of your lord 
but if you knew to whom you show this honour 
how true a gentleman you send relief 
how dear a lover of my lord your husband 
i know you would be prouder of the work
than customary bounty can enforce you 
madam with all my heart 
i shall obey you in all fair commands 
fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you 
madam i go with all convenient speed 
yes truly for look you the sins of the father
are to be laid upon the children: therefore i
promise ye i fear you i was always plain with
you and so now i speak my agitation of the matter:
therefore be of good cheer for truly i think you
are damned there is but one hope in it that can do
you any good and that is but a kind of bastard
hope neither 
marry you may partly hope that your father got you
not that you are not the jew s daughter 
truly then i fear you are damned both by father and
mother: thus when i shun scylla your father i
fall into charybdis your mother: well you are
gone both ways 
truly the more to blame he: we were christians
enow before e en as many as could well live one by
another this making christians will raise the
price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters we
shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money 
i shall grow jealous of you shortly launcelot if
you thus get my wife into corners 
i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
you can the getting up of the negro s belly: the
moor is with child by you launcelot 
it is much that the moor should be more than reason:
but if she be less than an honest woman she is
indeed more than i took her for 
how every fool can play upon the word i think the
best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence 
and discourse grow commendable in none only but
parrots go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner 
that is done sir they have all stomachs 
goodly lord what a wit-snapper are you then bid
them prepare dinner 
that is done too sir only cover is the word 
will you cover then sir 
not so sir neither i know my duty 
yet more quarrelling with occasion wilt thou show
the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant i pray
tree understand a plain man in his plain meaning:
go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve
in the meat and we will come in to dinner 
for the table sir it shall be served in for the
meat sir it shall be covered for your coming in
to dinner sir why let it be as humours and
conceits shall govern 
o dear discretion how his words are suited 
the fool hath planted in his memory
an army of good words and i do know
a many fools that stand in better place 
garnish d like him that for a tricksy word
defy the matter how cheerest thou jessica 
and now good sweet say thy opinion 
how dost thou like the lord bassanio s wife 
even such a husband
hast thou of me as she is for a wife 
i will anon: first let us go to dinner 
no pray thee let it serve for table-talk 
then howso er thou speak st mong other things
i shall digest it 
what is antonio here 
ready so please your grace 
i am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
a stony adversary an inhuman wretch
uncapable of pity void and empty
from any dram of mercy 
i have heard
your grace hath ta en great pains to qualify
his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate
and that no lawful means can carry me
out of his envy s reach i do oppose
my patience to his fury and am arm d
to suffer with a quietness of spirit 
the very tyranny and rage of his 
go one and call the jew into the court 
salerio
he is ready at the door: he comes my lord 
make room and let him stand before our face 
shylock the world thinks and i think so too 
that thou but lead st this fashion of thy malice
to the last hour of act and then tis thought
thou lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
than is thy strange apparent cruelty 
and where thou now exact st the penalty 
which is a pound of this poor merchant s flesh 
thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture 
but touch d with human gentleness and love 
forgive a moiety of the principal 
glancing an eye of pity on his losses 
that have of late so huddled on his back 
enow to press a royal merchant down
and pluck commiseration of his state
from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint 
from stubborn turks and tartars never train d
to offices of tender courtesy 
we all expect a gentle answer jew 
i have possess d your grace of what i purpose 
and by our holy sabbath have i sworn
to have the due and forfeit of my bond:
if you deny it let the danger light
upon your charter and your city s freedom 
you ll ask me why i rather choose to have
a weight of carrion flesh than to receive
three thousand ducats: i ll not answer that:
but say it is my humour: is it answer d 
what if my house be troubled with a rat
and i be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
to have it baned what are you answer d yet 
some men there are love not a gaping pig 
some that are mad if they behold a cat 
and others when the bagpipe sings i the nose 
cannot contain their urine: for affection 
mistress of passion sways it to the mood
of what it likes or loathes now for your answer:
as there is no firm reason to be render d 
why he cannot abide a gaping pig 
why he a harmless necessary cat 
why he a woollen bagpipe but of force
must yield to such inevitable shame
as to offend himself being offended 
so can i give no reason nor i will not 
more than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
i bear antonio that i follow thus
a losing suit against him are you answer d 
this is no answer thou unfeeling man 
to excuse the current of thy cruelty 
i am not bound to please thee with my answers 
do all men kill the things they do not love 
hates any man the thing he would not kill 
every offence is not a hate at first 
what wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice 
i pray you think you question with the jew:
you may as well go stand upon the beach
and bid the main flood bate his usual height 
you may as well use question with the wolf
why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb 
you may as well forbid the mountain pines
to wag their high tops and to make no noise 
when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven 
you may as well do anything most hard 
as seek to soften that than which what s harder 
his jewish heart: therefore i do beseech you 
make no more offers use no farther means 
but with all brief and plain conveniency
let me have judgment and the jew his will 
for thy three thousand ducats here is six 
what judgment shall i dread doing
were in six parts and every part a ducat 
i would not draw them i would have my bond 
how shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none 
what judgment shall i dread doing no wrong 
you have among you many a purchased slave 
which like your asses and your dogs and mules 
you use in abject and in slavish parts 
because you bought them: shall i say to you 
let them be free marry them to your heirs 
why sweat they under burthens let their beds
be made as soft as yours and let their palates
be season d with such viands you will answer
the slaves are ours: so do i answer you:
the pound of flesh which i demand of him 
is dearly bought tis mine and i will have it 
if you deny me fie upon your law 
there is no force in the decrees of venice 
i stand for judgment: answer shall i have it 
upon my power i may dismiss this court 
unless bellario a learned doctor 
whom i have sent for to determine this 
come here to-day 
salerio
my lord here stays without
a messenger with letters from the doctor 
new come from padua 
bring us the letter call the messenger 
good cheer antonio what man courage yet 
the jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all 
ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood 
i am a tainted wether of the flock 
meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
drops earliest to the ground and so let me
you cannot better be employ d bassanio 
than to live still and write mine epitaph 
came you from padua from bellario 
why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly 
to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there 
not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh jew 
thou makest thy knife keen but no metal can 
no not the hangman s axe bear half the keenness
of thy sharp envy can no prayers pierce thee 
no none that thou hast wit enough to make 
o be thou damn d inexecrable dog 
and for thy life let justice be accused 
thou almost makest me waver in my faith
to hold opinion with pythagoras 
that souls of animals infuse themselves
into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
govern d a wolf who hang d for human slaughter 
even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet 
and whilst thou lay st in thy unhallow d dam 
infused itself in thee for thy desires
are wolvish bloody starved and ravenous 
till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond 
thou but offend st thy lungs to speak so loud:
repair thy wit good youth or it will fall
to cureless ruin i stand here for law 
this letter from bellario doth commend
a young and learned doctor to our court 
where is he 
with all my heart some three or four of you
go give him courteous conduct to this place 
meantime the court shall hear bellario s letter 
clerk
your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
your letter i am very sick: but in the instant that
your messenger came in loving visitation was with
me a young doctor of rome his name is balthasar i
acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
the jew and antonio the merchant: we turned o er
many books together: he is furnished with my
opinion which bettered with his own learning the
greatness whereof i cannot enough commend comes
with him at my importunity to fill up your grace s
request in my stead i beseech you let his lack of
years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
estimation for i never knew so young a body with so
old a head i leave him to your gracious
acceptance whose trial shall better publish his
commendation 
you hear the learn d bellario what he writes:
and here i take it is the doctor come 
give me your hand come you from old bellario 
you are welcome: take your place 
are you acquainted with the difference
that holds this present question in the court 
antonio and old shylock both stand forth 
shylock is my name 
ay so he says 
i do 
on what compulsion must i tell me that 
my deeds upon my head i crave the law 
the penalty and forfeit of my bond 
yes here i tender it for him in the court 
yea twice the sum: if that will not suffice 
i will be bound to pay it ten times o er 
on forfeit of my hands my head my heart:
if this will not suffice it must appear
that malice bears down truth and i beseech you 
wrest once the law to your authority:
to do a great right do a little wrong 
and curb this cruel devil of his will 
a daniel come to judgment yea a daniel 
o wise young judge how i do honour thee 
here tis most reverend doctor here it is 
an oath an oath i have an oath in heaven:
shall i lay perjury upon my soul 
no not for venice 
when it is paid according to the tenor 
it doth appear you are a worthy judge 
you know the law your exposition
hath been most sound: i charge you by the law 
whereof you are a well-deserving pillar 
proceed to judgment: by my soul i swear
there is no power in the tongue of man
to alter me: i stay here on my bond 
most heartily i do beseech the court
to give the judgment 
o noble judge o excellent young man 
tis very true: o wise and upright judge 
how much more elder art thou than thy looks 
ay his breast:
so says the bond: doth it not noble judge 
nearest his heart: those are the very words 
i have them ready 
is it so nominated in the bond 
i cannot find it tis not in the bond 
but little: i am arm d and well prepared 
give me your hand bassanio: fare you well 
grieve not that i am fallen to this for you 
for herein fortune shows herself more kind
than is her custom: it is still her use
to let the wretched man outlive his wealth 
to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
an age of poverty from which lingering penance
of such misery doth she cut me off 
commend me to your honourable wife:
tell her the process of antonio s end 
say how i loved you speak me fair in death 
and when the tale is told bid her be judge
whether bassanio had not once a love 
repent but you that you shall lose your friend 
and he repents not that he pays your debt 
for if the jew do cut but deep enough 
i ll pay it presently with all my heart 
antonio i am married to a wife
which is as dear to me as life itself 
but life itself my wife and all the world 
are not with me esteem d above thy life:
i would lose all ay sacrifice them all
here to this devil to deliver you 
i have a wife whom i protest i love:
i would she were in heaven so she could
entreat some power to change this currish jew 
these be the christian husbands i have a daughter 
would any of the stock of barrabas
had been her husband rather than a christian 
we trifle time: i pray thee pursue sentence 
most rightful judge 
most learned judge a sentence come prepare 
o upright judge mark jew: o learned judge 
is that the law 
o learned judge mark jew: a learned judge 
i take this offer then pay the bond thrice
and let the christian go 
here is the money 
o jew an upright judge a learned judge 
a second daniel a daniel jew 
now infidel i have you on the hip 
give me my principal and let me go 
i have it ready for thee here it is 
a daniel still say i a second daniel 
i thank thee jew for teaching me that word 
shall i not have barely my principal 
why then the devil give him good of it 
i ll stay no longer question 
beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
and yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state 
thou hast not left the value of a cord 
therefore thou must be hang d at the state s charge 
that thou shalt see the difference of our spirits 
i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
for half thy wealth it is antonio s 
the other half comes to the general state 
which humbleness may drive unto a fine 
nay take my life and all pardon not that:
you take my house when you do take the prop
that doth sustain my house you take my life
when you do take the means whereby i live 
a halter gratis nothing else for god s sake 
so please my lord the duke and all the court
to quit the fine for one half of his goods 
i am content so he will let me have
the other half in use to render it 
upon his death unto the gentleman
that lately stole his daughter:
two things provided more that for this favour 
he presently become a christian 
the other that he do record a gift 
here in the court of all he dies possess d 
unto his son lorenzo and his daughter 
he shall do this or else i do recant
the pardon that i late pronounced here 
i am content 
i pray you give me leave to go from hence 
i am not well: send the deed after me 
and i will sign it 
get thee gone but do it 
in christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
had i been judge thou shouldst have had ten more 
to bring thee to the gallows not the font 
sir i entreat you home with me to dinner 
i am sorry that your leisure serves you not 
antonio gratify this gentleman 
for in my mind you are much bound to him 
most worthy gentleman i and my friend
have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
of grievous penalties in lieu whereof 
three thousand ducats due unto the jew 
we freely cope your courteous pains withal 
and stand indebted over and above 
in love and service to you evermore 
dear sir of force i must attempt you further:
take some remembrance of us as a tribute 
not as a fee: grant me two things i pray you 
not to deny me and to pardon me 
this ring good sir alas it is a trifle 
i will not shame myself to give you this 
there s more depends on this than on the value 
the dearest ring in venice will i give you 
and find it out by proclamation:
only for this i pray you pardon me 
good sir this ring was given me by my wife 
and when she put it on she made me vow
that i should neither sell nor give nor lose it 
my lord bassanio let him have the ring:
let his deservings and my love withal
be valued against your wife s commandment 
go gratiano run and overtake him 
give him the ring and bring him if thou canst 
unto antonio s house: away make haste 
come you and i will thither presently 
and in the morning early will we both
fly toward belmont: come antonio 
fair sir you are well o erta en
my lord bassanio upon more advice
hath sent you here this ring and doth entreat
your company at dinner 
that will i do 
the moon shines bright: in such a night as this 
when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
and they did make no noise in such a night
troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls
and sigh d his soul toward the grecian tents 
where cressid lay that night 
in such a night
stood dido with a willow in her hand
upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
to come again to carthage 
in such a night
did jessica steal from the wealthy jew
and with an unthrift love did run from venice
as far as belmont 
in such a night
did pretty jessica like a little shrew 
slander her love and he forgave it her 
who comes so fast in silence of the night 
stephano
a friend 
a friend what friend your name i pray you friend 
stephano
stephano is my name and i bring word
my mistress will before the break of day
be here at belmont she doth stray about
by holy crosses where she kneels and prays
for happy wedlock hours 
who comes with her 
stephano
none but a holy hermit and her maid 
i pray you is my master yet return d 
he is not nor we have not heard from him 
but go we in i pray thee jessica 
and ceremoniously let us prepare
some welcome for the mistress of the house 
sola sola wo ha ho sola sola 
who calls 
sola did you see master lorenzo 
master lorenzo sola sola 
leave hollaing man: here 
sola where where 
here 
tell him there s a post come from my master with
his horn full of good news: my master will be here
ere morning 
sweet soul let s in and there expect their coming 
and yet no matter: why should we go in 
my friend stephano signify i pray you 
within the house your mistress is at hand 
and bring your music forth into the air 
how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank 
here will we sit and let the sounds of music
creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
become the touches of sweet harmony 
sit jessica look how the floor of heaven
is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
there s not the smallest orb which thou behold st
but in his motion like an angel sings 
still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins 
such harmony is in immortal souls 
but whilst this muddy vesture of decay
doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it 
come ho and wake diana with a hymn 
with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear 
and draw her home with music 
the reason is your spirits are attentive:
for do but note a wild and wanton herd 
or race of youthful and unhandled colts 
fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud 
which is the hot condition of their blood 
if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound 
or any air of music touch their ears 
you shall perceive them make a mutual stand 
their savage eyes turn d to a modest gaze
by the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods 
since nought so stockish hard and full of rage 
but music for the time doth change his nature 
the man that hath no music in himself 
nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds 
is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils 
the motions of his spirit are dull as night
and his affections dark as erebus:
let no such man be trusted mark the music 
that is the voice 
or i am much deceived of portia 
dear lady welcome home 
madam they are not yet 
but there is come a messenger before 
to signify their coming 
your husband is at hand i hear his trumpet:
we are no tell-tales madam fear you not 
we should hold day with the antipodes 
if you would walk in absence of the sun 
i thank you madam give welcome to my friend 
this is the man this is antonio 
to whom i am so infinitely bound 
no more than i am well acquitted of 
[to female] by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong 
in faith i gave it to the judge s clerk:
would he were gelt that had it for my part 
since you do take it love so much at heart 
about a hoop of gold a paltry ring
that she did give me whose posy was
for all the world like cutler s poetry
upon a knife love me and leave me not 
he will an if he live to be a man 
now by this hand i gave it to a youth 
a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy 
no higher than thyself the judge s clerk 
a prating boy that begg d it as a fee:
i could not for my heart deny it him 
[aside] why i were best to cut my left hand off
and swear i lost the ring defending it 
my lord bassanio gave his ring away
unto the judge that begg d it and indeed
deserved it too and then the boy his clerk 
that took some pains in writing he begg d mine 
and neither man nor master would take aught
but the two rings 
if i could add a lie unto a fault 
i would deny it but you see my finger
hath not the ring upon it it is gone 
sweet portia 
if you did know to whom i gave the ring 
if you did know for whom i gave the ring
and would conceive for what i gave the ring
and how unwillingly i left the ring 
when nought would be accepted but the ring 
you would abate the strength of your displeasure 
no by my honour madam by my soul 
no woman had it but a civil doctor 
which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
and begg d the ring the which i did deny him
and suffer d him to go displeased away 
even he that did uphold the very life
of my dear friend what should i say sweet lady 
i was enforced to send it after him 
i was beset with shame and courtesy 
my honour would not let ingratitude
so much besmear it pardon me good lady 
for by these blessed candles of the night 
had you been there i think you would have begg d
the ring of me to give the worthy doctor 
well do you so let not me take him then 
for if i do i ll mar the young clerk s pen 
i am the unhappy subject of these quarrels 
portia forgive me this enforced wrong 
and in the hearing of these many friends 
i swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes 
wherein i see myself 
nay but hear me:
pardon this fault and by my soul i swear
i never more will break an oath with thee 
i once did lend my body for his wealth 
which but for him that had your husband s ring 
had quite miscarried: i dare be bound again 
my soul upon the forfeit that your lord
will never more break faith advisedly 
here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring 
by heaven it is the same i gave the doctor 
why this is like the mending of highways
in summer where the ways are fair enough:
what are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it 
i am dumb 
were you the doctor and i knew you not 
were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold 
sweet doctor you shall be my bed-fellow:
when i am absent then lie with my wife 
sweet lady you have given me life and living 
for here i read for certain that my ships
are safely come to road 
fair ladies you drop manna in the way
of starved people 
let it be so: the first inter gatory
that my nerissa shall be sworn on is 
whether till the next night she had rather stay 
or go to bed now being two hours to day:
but were the day come i should wish it dark 
that i were couching with the doctor s clerk 
well while i live i ll fear no other thing
so sore as keeping safe nerissa s ring 
tush never tell me i take it much unkindly
that thou iago who hast had my purse
as if the strings were thine shouldst know of this 
sblood but you will not hear me:
if ever i did dream of such a matter abhor me 
thou told st me thou didst hold him in thy hate 
despise me if i do not three great ones of the city 
in personal suit to make me his lieutenant 
off-capp d to him: and by the faith of man 
i know my price i am worth no worse a place:
but he as loving his own pride and purposes 
evades them with a bombast circumstance
horribly stuff d with epithets of war 
and in conclusion 
nonsuits my mediators for certes says he 
i have already chose my officer 
and what was he 
forsooth a great arithmetician 
one michael cassio a florentine 
a fellow almost damn d in a fair wife 
that never set a squadron in the field 
nor the division of a battle knows
more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric 
wherein the toged consuls can propose
as masterly as he: mere prattle without practise 
is all his soldiership but he sir had the election:
and i of whom his eyes had seen the proof
at rhodes at cyprus and on other grounds
christian and heathen must be be-lee d and calm d
by debitor and creditor: this counter-caster 
he in good time must his lieutenant be 
and i god bless the mark his moorship s ancient 
by heaven i rather would have been his hangman 
why there s no remedy tis the curse of service 
preferment goes by letter and affection 
and not by old gradation where each second
stood heir to the first now sir be judge yourself 
whether i in any just term am affined
to love the moor 
i would not follow him then 
o sir content you 
i follow him to serve my turn upon him:
we cannot all be masters nor all masters
cannot be truly follow d you shall mark
many a duteous and knee-crooking knave 
that doting on his own obsequious bondage 
wears out his time much like his master s ass 
for nought but provender and when he s old cashier d:
whip me such honest knaves others there are
who trimm d in forms and visages of duty 
keep yet their hearts attending on themselves 
and throwing but shows of service on their lords 
do well thrive by them and when they have lined
their coats
do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul 
and such a one do i profess myself for sir 
it is as sure as you are roderigo 
were i the moor i would not be iago:
in following him i follow but myself 
heaven is my judge not i for love and duty 
but seeming so for my peculiar end:
for when my outward action doth demonstrate
the native act and figure of my heart
in compliment extern tis not long after
but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve
for daws to peck at: i am not what i am 
what a full fortune does the thicklips owe
if he can carry t thus 
call up her father 
rouse him: make after him poison his delight 
proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen 
and though he in a fertile climate dwell 
plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy 
yet throw such changes of vexation on t 
as it may lose some colour 
here is her father s house i ll call aloud 
do with like timorous accent and dire yell
as when by night and negligence the fire
is spied in populous cities 
what ho brabantio signior brabantio ho 
awake what ho brabantio thieves thieves thieves 
look to your house your daughter and your bags 
thieves thieves 
what is the reason of this terrible summons 
what is the matter there 
signior is all your family within 
are your doors lock d 
why wherefore ask you this 
zounds sir you re robb d for shame put on
your gown 
your heart is burst you have lost half your soul 
even now now very now an old black ram
is topping your white ewe arise arise 
awake the snorting citizens with the bell 
or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
arise i say 
what have you lost your wits 
most reverend signior do you know my voice 
not i what are you 
my name is roderigo 
the worser welcome:
i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
in honest plainness thou hast heard me say
my daughter is not for thee and now in madness 
being full of supper and distempering draughts 
upon malicious bravery dost thou come
to start my quiet 
sir sir sir 
but thou must needs be sure
my spirit and my place have in them power
to make this bitter to thee 
patience good sir 
what tell st thou me of robbing this is venice 
my house is not a grange 
most grave brabantio 
in simple and pure soul i come to you 
zounds sir you are one of those that will not
serve god if the devil bid you because we come to
do you service and you think we are ruffians you ll
have your daughter covered with a barbary horse 
you ll have your nephews neigh to you you ll have
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans 
what profane wretch art thou 
i am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter
and the moor are now making the beast with two backs 
thou art a villain 
you are a senator 
this thou shalt answer i know thee roderigo 
sir i will answer any thing but i beseech you 
if t be your pleasure and most wise consent 
as partly i find it is that your fair daughter 
at this odd-even and dull watch o the night 
transported with no worse nor better guard
but with a knave of common hire a gondolier 
to the gross clasps of a lascivious moor 
if this be known to you and your allowance 
we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs 
but if you know not this my manners tell me
we have your wrong rebuke do not believe
that from the sense of all civility 
i thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
your daughter if you have not given her leave 
i say again hath made a gross revolt 
tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes
in an extravagant and wheeling stranger
of here and every where straight satisfy yourself:
if she be in her chamber or your house 
let loose on me the justice of the state
for thus deluding you 
strike on the tinder ho 
give me a taper call up all my people 
this accident is not unlike my dream:
belief of it oppresses me already 
light i say light 
farewell for i must leave you:
it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place 
to be produced as if i stay i shall 
against the moor: for i do know the state 
however this may gall him with some cheque 
cannot with safety cast him for he s embark d
with such loud reason to the cyprus wars 
which even now stand in act that for their souls 
another of his fathom they have none 
to lead their business: in which regard 
though i do hate him as i do hell-pains 
yet for necessity of present life 
i must show out a flag and sign of love 
which is indeed but sign that you shall surely find him 
lead to the sagittary the raised search 
and there will i be with him so farewell 
it is too true an evil: gone she is 
and what s to come of my despised time
is nought but bitterness now roderigo 
where didst thou see her o unhappy girl 
with the moor say st thou who would be a father 
how didst thou know twas she o she deceives me
past thought what said she to you get more tapers:
raise all my kindred are they married think you 
truly i think they are 
o heaven how got she out o treason of the blood 
fathers from hence trust not your daughters minds
by what you see them act is there not charms
by which the property of youth and maidhood
may be abused have you not read roderigo 
of some such thing 
yes sir i have indeed 
call up my brother o would you had had her 
some one way some another do you know
where we may apprehend her and the moor 
i think i can discover him if you please 
to get good guard and go along with me 
pray you lead on at every house i ll call 
i may command at most get weapons ho 
and raise some special officers of night 
on good roderigo: i ll deserve your pains 
though in the trade of war i have slain men 
yet do i hold it very stuff o the conscience
to do no contrived murder: i lack iniquity
sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
i had thought to have yerk d him here under the ribs 
tis better as it is 
nay but he prated 
and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
against your honour
that with the little godliness i have 
i did full hard forbear him but i pray you sir 
are you fast married be assured of this 
that the magnifico is much beloved 
and hath in his effect a voice potential
as double as the duke s: he will divorce you 
or put upon you what restraint and grievance
the law with all his might to enforce it on 
will give him cable 
let him do his spite:
my services which i have done the signiory
shall out-tongue his complaints tis yet to know 
which when i know that boasting is an honour 
i shall promulgate i fetch my life and being
from men of royal siege and my demerits
may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
as this that i have reach d: for know iago 
but that i love the gentle desdemona 
i would not my unhoused free condition
put into circumscription and confine
for the sea s worth but look what lights come yond 
those are the raised father and his friends:
you were best go in 
not i i must be found:
my parts my title and my perfect soul
shall manifest me rightly is it they 
by janus i think no 
enter male and certain officers with torches
the servants of the duke and my lieutenant 
the goodness of the night upon you friends 
what is the news 
the duke does greet you general 
and he requires your haste-post-haste appearance 
even on the instant 
what is the matter think you 
something from cyprus as i may divine:
it is a business of some heat: the galleys
have sent a dozen sequent messengers
this very night at one another s heels 
and many of the consuls raised and met 
are at the duke s already: you have been
hotly call d for 
when being not at your lodging to be found 
the senate hath sent about three several guests
to search you out 
tis well i am found by you 
i will but spend a word here in the house 
and go with you 
ancient what makes he here 
faith he to-night hath boarded a land carack:
if it prove lawful prize he s made for ever 
i do not understand 
he s married 
to who 
marry to come captain will you go 
have with you 
here comes another troop to seek for you 
it is brabantio general be advised 
he comes to bad intent 
holla stand there 
signior it is the moor 
down with him thief 
you roderigo come sir i am for you 
keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them 
good signior you shall more command with years
than with your weapons 
o thou foul thief where hast thou stow d my daughter 
damn d as thou art thou hast enchanted her 
for i ll refer me to all things of sense 
if she in chains of magic were not bound 
whether a maid so tender fair and happy 
so opposite to marriage that she shunned
the wealthy curled darlings of our nation 
would ever have to incur a general mock 
run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight 
judge me the world if tis not gross in sense
that thou hast practised on her with foul charms 
abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
that weaken motion: i ll have t disputed on 
tis probable and palpable to thinking 
i therefore apprehend and do attach thee
for an abuser of the world a practiser
of arts inhibited and out of warrant 
lay hold upon him: if he do resist 
subdue him at his peril 
hold your hands 
both you of my inclining and the rest:
were it my cue to fight i should have known it
without a prompter where will you that i go
to answer this your charge 
to prison till fit time
of law and course of direct session
call thee to answer 
what if i do obey 
how may the duke be therewith satisfied 
whose messengers are here about my side 
upon some present business of the state
to bring me to him 
first officer
’tis true most worthy signior 
the duke s in council and your noble self 
i am sure is sent for 
how the duke in council 
in this time of the night bring him away:
mine s not an idle cause: the duke himself 
or any of my brothers of the state 
cannot but feel this wrong as twere their own 
for if such actions may have passage free 
bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be 
there is no composition in these news
that gives them credit 
first senator
indeed they are disproportion d 
my letters say a hundred and seven galleys 
and mine a hundred and forty 
second senator
and mine two hundred:
but though they jump not on a just account 
as in these cases where the aim reports 
tis oft with difference yet do they all confirm
a turkish fleet and bearing up to cyprus 
nay it is possible enough to judgment:
i do not so secure me in the error 
but the main article i do approve
in fearful sense 
sailor
[within] what ho what ho what ho 
first officer
a messenger from the galleys 
now what s the business 
sailor
the turkish preparation makes for rhodes 
so was i bid report here to the state
by signior angelo 
how say you by this change 
first senator
this cannot be 
by no assay of reason: tis a pageant 
to keep us in false gaze when we consider
the importancy of cyprus to the turk 
and let ourselves again but understand 
that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes 
so may he with more facile question bear it 
for that it stands not in such warlike brace 
but altogether lacks the abilities
that rhodes is dress d in: if we make thought of this 
we must not think the turk is so unskilful
to leave that latest which concerns him first 
neglecting an attempt of ease and gain 
to wake and wage a danger profitless 
nay in all confidence he s not for rhodes 
first officer
here is more news 
messenger
the ottomites reverend and gracious 
steering with due course towards the isle of rhodes 
have there injointed them with an after fleet 
first senator
ay so i thought how many as you guess 
messenger
of thirty sail: and now they do restem
their backward course bearing with frank appearance
their purposes toward cyprus signior montano 
your trusty and most valiant servitor 
with his free duty recommends you thus 
and prays you to believe him 
tis certain then for cyprus 
marcus luccicos is not he in town 
first senator
he s now in florence 
write from us to him post-post-haste dispatch 
first senator
here comes brabantio and the valiant moor 
enter male male male male and officers
valiant othello we must straight employ you
against the general enemy ottoman 
i did not see you welcome gentle signior 
we lack d your counsel and your help tonight 
so did i yours good your grace pardon me 
neither my place nor aught i heard of business
hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care
take hold on me for my particular grief
is of so flood-gate and o erbearing nature
that it engluts and swallows other sorrows
and it is still itself 
why what s the matter 
my daughter o my daughter 
male 
dead 
ay to me 
she is abused stol n from me and corrupted
by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks 
for nature so preposterously to err 
being not deficient blind or lame of sense 
sans witchcraft could not 
whoe er he be that in this foul proceeding
hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
and you of her the bloody book of law
you shall yourself read in the bitter letter
after your own sense yea though our proper son
stood in your action 
humbly i thank your grace 
here is the man this moor whom now it seems 
your special mandate for the state-affairs
hath hither brought 
male senator
we are very sorry for t 
[to male] what in your own part can you say to this 
nothing but this is so 
most potent grave and reverend signiors 
my very noble and approved good masters 
that i have ta en away this old man s daughter 
it is most true true i have married her:
the very head and front of my offending
hath this extent no more rude am i in my speech 
and little bless d with the soft phrase of peace:
for since these arms of mine had seven years pith 
till now some nine moons wasted they have used
their dearest action in the tented field 
and little of this great world can i speak 
more than pertains to feats of broil and battle 
and therefore little shall i grace my cause
in speaking for myself yet by your gracious patience 
i will a round unvarnish d tale deliver
of my whole course of love what drugs what charms 
what conjuration and what mighty magic 
for such proceeding i am charged withal 
i won his daughter 
a maiden never bold 
of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
blush d at herself and she in spite of nature 
of years of country credit every thing 
to fall in love with what she fear d to look on 
it is a judgment maim d and most imperfect
that will confess perfection so could err
against all rules of nature and must be driven
to find out practises of cunning hell 
why this should be i therefore vouch again
that with some mixtures powerful o er the blood 
or with some dram conjured to this effect 
he wrought upon her 
to vouch this is no proof 
without more wider and more overt test
than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
of modern seeming do prefer against him 
first senator
but othello speak:
did you by indirect and forced courses
subdue and poison this young maid s affections 
or came it by request and such fair question
as soul to soul affordeth 
i do beseech you 
send for the lady to the sagittary 
and let her speak of me before her father:
if you do find me foul in her report 
the trust the office i do hold of you 
not only take away but let your sentence
even fall upon my life 
fetch desdemona hither 
ancient conduct them: you best know the place 
and till she come as truly as to heaven
i do confess the vices of my blood 
so justly to your grave ears i ll present
how i did thrive in this fair lady s love 
and she in mine 
say it othello 
her father loved me oft invited me 
still question d me the story of my life 
from year to year the battles sieges fortunes 
that i have passed 
i ran it through even from my boyish days 
to the very moment that he bade me tell it 
wherein i spake of most disastrous chances 
of moving accidents by flood and field
of hair-breadth scapes i the imminent deadly breach 
of being taken by the insolent foe
and sold to slavery of my redemption thence
and portance in my travels history:
wherein of antres vast and deserts idle 
rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
it was my hint to speak such was the process 
and of the cannibals that each other eat 
the anthropophagi and men whose heads
do grow beneath their shoulders this to hear
would desdemona seriously incline:
but still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
which ever as she could with haste dispatch 
she ld come again and with a greedy ear
devour up my discourse: which i observing 
took once a pliant hour and found good means
to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
that i would all my pilgrimage dilate 
whereof by parcels she had something heard 
but not intentively: i did consent 
and often did beguile her of her tears 
when i did speak of some distressful stroke
that my youth suffer d my story being done 
she gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange 
twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful:
she wish d she had not heard it yet she wish d
that heaven had made her such a man: she thank d me 
and bade me if i had a friend that loved her 
i should but teach him how to tell my story 
and that would woo her upon this hint i spake:
she loved me for the dangers i had pass d 
and i loved her that she did pity them 
this only is the witchcraft i have used:
here comes the lady let her witness it 
i think this tale would win my daughter too 
good brabantio 
take up this mangled matter at the best:
men do their broken weapons rather use
than their bare hands 
i pray you hear her speak:
if she confess that she was half the wooer 
destruction on my head if my bad blame
light on the man come hither gentle mistress:
do you perceive in all this noble company
where most you owe obedience 
god be wi you i have done 
please it your grace on to the state-affairs:
i had rather to adopt a child than get it 
come hither moor:
i here do give thee that with all my heart
which but thou hast already with all my heart
i would keep from thee for your sake jewel 
i am glad at soul i have no other child:
for thy escape would teach me tyranny 
to hang clogs on them i have done my lord 
let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence 
which as a grise or step may help these lovers
into your favour 
when remedies are past the griefs are ended
by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended 
to mourn a mischief that is past and gone
is the next way to draw new mischief on 
what cannot be preserved when fortune takes
patience her injury a mockery makes 
the robb d that smiles steals something from the thief 
he robs himself that spends a bootless grief 
so let the turk of cyprus us beguile 
we lose it not so long as we can smile 
he bears the sentence well that nothing bears
but the free comfort which from thence he hears 
but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow 
these sentences to sugar or to gall 
being strong on both sides are equivocal:
but words are words i never yet did hear
that the bruised heart was pierced through the ear 
i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state 
the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
cyprus othello the fortitude of the place is best
known to you and though we have there a substitute
of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a
sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer
voice on you: you must therefore be content to
slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
more stubborn and boisterous expedition 
the tyrant custom most grave senators 
hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
my thrice-driven bed of down: i do agnise
a natural and prompt alacrity
i find in hardness and do undertake
these present wars against the ottomites 
most humbly therefore bending to your state 
i crave fit disposition for my wife 
due reference of place and exhibition 
with such accommodation and besort
as levels with her breeding 
if you please 
be t at her father s 
i ll not have it so 
nor i 
what would you desdemona 
let her have your voices 
vouch with me heaven i therefore beg it not 
to please the palate of my appetite 
nor to comply with heat the young affects
in me defunct and proper satisfaction 
but to be free and bounteous to her mind:
and heaven defend your good souls that you think
i will your serious and great business scant
for she is with me: no when light-wing d toys
of feather d cupid seal with wanton dullness
my speculative and officed instruments 
that my disports corrupt and taint my business 
let housewives make a skillet of my helm 
and all indign and base adversities
make head against my estimation 
be it as you shall privately determine 
either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste 
and speed must answer it 
first senator
you must away to-night 
with all my heart 
at nine i the morning here we ll meet again 
othello leave some officer behind 
and he shall our commission bring to you 
with such things else of quality and respect
as doth import you 
so please your grace my ancient 
a man he is of honest and trust:
to his conveyance i assign my wife 
with what else needful your good grace shall think
to be sent after me 
let it be so 
good night to every one 
and noble signior 
if virtue no delighted beauty lack 
your son-in-law is far more fair than black 
first senator
adieu brave moor use desdemona well 
look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see:
she has deceived her father and may thee 
my life upon her faith honest iago 
my desdemona must i leave to thee:
i prithee let thy wife attend on her:
and bring them after in the best advantage 
come desdemona: i have but an hour
of love of worldly matters and direction 
to spend with thee: we must obey the time 
iago 
what say st thou noble heart 
what will i do thinkest thou 
why go to bed and sleep 
i will incontinently drown myself 
if thou dost i shall never love thee after why 
thou silly gentleman 
it is silliness to live when to live is torment and
then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician 
o villainous i have looked upon the world for four
times seven years and since i could distinguish
betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man
that knew how to love himself ere i would say i
would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen i
would change my humanity with a baboon 
what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so
fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it 
virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus
or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which
our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up
thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or
distract it with many either to have it sterile
with idleness or manured with industry why the
power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
wills if the balance of our lives had not one
scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the
blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
reason to cool our raging motions our carnal
stings our unbitted lusts whereof i take this that
you call love to be a sect or scion 
it cannot be 
it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
the will come be a man drown thyself drown
cats and blind puppies i have professed me thy
friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with
cables of perdurable toughness i could never
better stead thee than now put money in thy
purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with
an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse it
cannot be that desdemona should long continue her
love to the moor put money in thy purse nor he
his to her: it was a violent commencement and thou
shalt see an answerable sequestration: put but
money in thy purse these moors are changeable in
their wills: fill thy purse with money: the food
that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be
to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must
change for youth: when she is sated with his body 
she will find the error of her choice: she must
have change she must: therefore put money in thy
purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a
more delicate way than drowning make all the money
thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not
too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou
shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of
drowning thyself it is clean out of the way: seek
thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
to be drowned and go without her 
wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on
the issue 
thou art sure of me: go make money: i have told
thee often and i re-tell thee again and again i
hate the moor: my cause is hearted thine hath no
less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge
against him: if thou canst cuckold him thou dost
thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many
events in the womb of time which will be delivered 
traverse go provide thy money we will have more
of this to-morrow adieu 
where shall we meet i the morning 
at my lodging 
i ll be with thee betimes 
go to farewell do you hear roderigo 
what say you 
no more of drowning do you hear 
i am changed: i ll go sell all my land 
thus do i ever make my fool my purse:
for i mine own gain d knowledge should profane 
if i would time expend with such a snipe 
but for my sport and profit i hate the moor:
and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets
he has done my office: i know not if t be true 
but i for mere suspicion in that kind 
will do as if for surety he holds me well 
the better shall my purpose work on him 
cassio s a proper man: let me see now:
to get his place and to plume up my will
in double knavery how how let s see: 
after some time to abuse othello s ear
that he is too familiar with his wife 
he hath a person and a smooth dispose
to be suspected framed to make women false 
the moor is of a free and open nature 
that thinks men honest that but seem to be so 
and will as tenderly be led by the nose
as asses are 
i have t it is engender d hell and night
must bring this monstrous birth to the world s light 
what from the cape can you discern at sea 
first gentleman
nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood 
i cannot twixt the heaven and the main 
descry a sail 
methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land 
a fuller blast ne er shook our battlements:
if it hath ruffian d so upon the sea 
what ribs of oak when mountains melt on them 
can hold the mortise what shall we hear of this 
second gentleman
a segregation of the turkish fleet:
for do but stand upon the foaming shore 
the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds 
the wind-shaked surge with high and monstrous mane 
seems to cast water on the burning bear 
and quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:
i never did like molestation view
on the enchafed flood 
if that the turkish fleet
be not enshelter d and embay d they are drown d:
it is impossible they bear it out 
third gentleman
news lads our wars are done 
the desperate tempest hath so bang d the turks 
that their designment halts: a noble ship of venice
hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
on most part of their fleet 
how is this true 
third gentleman
the ship is here put in 
a veronesa michael cassio 
lieutenant to the warlike moor othello 
is come on shore: the moor himself at sea 
and is in full commission here for cyprus 
i am glad on t tis a worthy governor 
third gentleman
but this same cassio though he speak of comfort
touching the turkish loss yet he looks sadly 
and prays the moor be safe for they were parted
with foul and violent tempest 
pray heavens he be 
for i have served him and the man commands
like a full soldier let s to the seaside ho 
as well to see the vessel that s come in
as to throw out our eyes for brave othello 
even till we make the main and the aerial blue
an indistinct regard 
third gentleman
come let s do so:
for every minute is expectancy
of more arrivance 
thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle 
that so approve the moor o let the heavens
give him defence against the elements 
for i have lost us him on a dangerous sea 
is he well shipp d 
his bark is stoutly timber d his pilot
of very expert and approved allowance 
therefore my hopes not surfeited to death 
stand in bold cure 
what noise 
fourth gentleman
the town is empty on the brow o the sea
stand ranks of people and they cry a sail 
my hopes do shape him for the governor 
second gentleman
they do discharge their shot of courtesy:
our friends at least 
i pray you sir go forth 
and give us truth who tis that is arrived 
second gentleman
i shall 
but good lieutenant is your general wived 
most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
that paragons description and wild fame 
one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens 
and in the essential vesture of creation
does tire the ingener 
how now who has put in 
second gentleman
tis one iago ancient to the general 
has had most favourable and happy speed:
tempests themselves high seas and howling winds 
the gutter d rocks and congregated sands 
traitors ensteep d to clog the guiltless keel 
as having sense of beauty do omit
their mortal natures letting go safely by
the divine desdemona 
what is she 
she that i spake of our great captain s captain 
left in the conduct of the bold iago 
whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
a se nnight s speed great jove othello guard 
and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath 
that he may bless this bay with his tall ship 
make love s quick pants in desdemona s arms 
give renew d fire to our extincted spirits
and bring all cyprus comfort 
o behold 
the riches of the ship is come on shore 
ye men of cyprus let her have your knees 
hail to thee lady and the grace of heaven 
before behind thee and on every hand 
enwheel thee round 
he is not yet arrived: nor know i aught
but that he s well and will be shortly here 
the great contention of the sea and skies
parted our fellowship but hark a sail 
second gentleman
they give their greeting to the citadel 
this likewise is a friend 
see for the news 
good ancient you are welcome 
welcome mistress 
let it not gall your patience good iago 
that i extend my manners tis my breeding
that gives me this bold show of courtesy 
sir would she give you so much of her lips
as of her tongue she oft bestows on me 
you ll have enough 
in faith too much 
i find it still when i have list to sleep:
marry before your ladyship i grant 
she puts her tongue a little in her heart 
and chides with thinking 
come on come on you are pictures out of doors 
bells in your parlors wild-cats in your kitchens 
saints m your injuries devils being offended 
players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds 
nay it is true or else i am a turk:
you rise to play and go to bed to work 
no let me not 
o gentle lady do not put me to t 
for i am nothing if not critical 
ay madam 
i am about it but indeed my invention
comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize 
it plucks out brains and all: but my muse labours 
and thus she is deliver d 
if she be fair and wise fairness and wit 
the one s for use the other useth it 
if she be black and thereto have a wit 
she ll find a white that shall her blackness fit 
she never yet was foolish that was fair 
for even her folly help d her to an heir 
there s none so foul and foolish thereunto 
but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do 
she that was ever fair and never proud 
had tongue at will and yet was never loud 
never lack d gold and yet went never gay 
fled from her wish and yet said now i may 
she that being anger d her revenge being nigh 
bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly 
she that in wisdom never was so frail
to change the cod s head for the salmon s tail 
she that could think and ne er disclose her mind 
see suitors following and not look behind 
she was a wight if ever such wight were 
to suckle fools and chronicle small beer 
he speaks home madam: you may relish him more in
the soldier than in the scholar 
he takes her by the palm: ay well said 
whisper: with as little a web as this will i
ensnare as great a fly as cassio ay smile upon
her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship 
you say true tis so indeed: if such tricks as
these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had
been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
oft which now again you are most apt to play the
sir in very good well kissed an excellent
courtesy tis so indeed yet again your fingers
to your lips would they were clyster-pipes for your sake 
the moor i know his trumpet 
tis truly so 
lo where he comes 
o my fair warrior 
it gives me wonder great as my content
to see you here before me o my soul s joy 
if after every tempest come such calms 
may the winds blow till they have waken d death 
and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
olympus-high and duck again as low
as hell s from heaven if it were now to die 
twere now to be most happy for i fear 
my soul hath her content so absolute
that not another comfort like to this
succeeds in unknown fate 
amen to that sweet powers 
i cannot speak enough of this content 
it stops me here it is too much of joy:
and this and this the greatest discords be
kissing her
that e er our hearts shall make 
[aside] o you are well tuned now 
but i ll set down the pegs that make this music 
as honest as i am 
come let us to the castle 
news friends our wars are done the turks
are drown d 
how does my old acquaintance of this isle 
honey you shall be well desired in cyprus 
i have found great love amongst them o my sweet 
i prattle out of fashion and i dote
in mine own comforts i prithee good iago 
go to the bay and disembark my coffers:
bring thou the master to the citadel 
he is a good one and his worthiness
does challenge much respect come desdemona 
once more well met at cyprus 
exeunt male female and attendants
do thou meet me presently at the harbour come
hither if thou be st valiant as they say base
men being in love have then a nobility in their
natures more than is native to them list me the
lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
guard: first i must tell thee this desdemona is
directly in love with him 
with him why tis not possible 
lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed 
mark me with what violence she first loved the moor 
but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
and will she love him still for prating let not
thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed 
and what delight shall she have to look on the
devil when the blood is made dull with the act of
sport there should be again to inflame it and to
give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour 
sympathy in years manners and beauties all which
the moor is defective in: now for want of these
required conveniences her delicate tenderness will
find itself abused begin to heave the gorge 
disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will
instruct her in it and compel her to some second
choice now sir this granted as it is a most
pregnant and unforced position who stands so
eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio
does a knave very voluble no further
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
civil and humane seeming for the better compassing
of his salt and most hidden loose affection why 
none why none: a slipper and subtle knave a
finder of occasions that has an eye can stamp and
counterfeit advantages though true advantage never
present itself a devilish knave besides the
knave is handsome young and hath all those
requisites in him that folly and green minds look
after: a pestilent complete knave and the woman
hath found him already 
i cannot believe that in her she s full of
most blessed condition 
blessed fig s-end the wine she drinks is made of
grapes: if she had been blessed she would never
have loved the moor blessed pudding didst thou
not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst
not mark that 
yes that i did but that was but courtesy 
lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue
to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met
so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
together villanous thoughts roderigo when these
mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes
the master and main exercise the incorporate
conclusion pish but sir be you ruled by me: i
have brought you from venice watch you to-night 
for the command i ll lay t upon you cassio knows
you not i ll not be far from you: do you find
some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking
too loud or tainting his discipline or from what
other course you please which the time shall more
favourably minister 
well 
sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply
may strike at you: provoke him that he may for
even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to
mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true
taste again but by the displanting of cassio so
shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
the means i shall then have to prefer them and the
impediment most profitably removed without the
which there were no expectation of our prosperity 
i will do this if i can bring it to any
opportunity 
i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel:
i must fetch his necessaries ashore farewell 
adieu 
that cassio loves her i do well believe it 
that she loves him tis apt and of great credit:
the moor howbeit that i endure him not 
is of a constant loving noble nature 
and i dare think he ll prove to desdemona
a most dear husband now i do love her too 
not out of absolute lust though peradventure
i stand accountant for as great a sin 
but partly led to diet my revenge 
for that i do suspect the lusty moor
hath leap d into my seat the thought whereof
doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards 
and nothing can or shall content my soul
till i am even d with him wife for wife 
or failing so yet that i put the moor
at least into a jealousy so strong
that judgment cannot cure which thing to do 
if this poor trash of venice whom i trash
for his quick hunting stand the putting on 
i ll have our michael cassio on the hip 
abuse him to the moor in the rank garb 
for i fear cassio with my night-cap too 
make the moor thank me love me and reward me 
for making him egregiously an ass
and practising upon his peace and quiet
even to madness tis here but yet confused:
knavery s plain face is never seen tin used 
herald
it is othello s pleasure our noble and valiant
general that upon certain tidings now arrived 
importing the mere perdition of the turkish fleet 
every man put himself into triumph some to dance 
some to make bonfires each man to what sport and
revels his addiction leads him: for besides these
beneficial news it is the celebration of his
nuptial so much was his pleasure should be
proclaimed all offices are open and there is full
liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
till the bell have told eleven heaven bless the
isle of cyprus and our noble general othello 
good michael look you to the guard to-night:
let s teach ourselves that honourable stop 
not to outsport discretion 
iago hath direction what to do 
but notwithstanding with my personal eye
will i look to t 
iago is most honest 
michael good night: to-morrow with your earliest
let me have speech with you 
come my dear love 
the purchase made the fruits are to ensue 
that profit s yet to come tween me and you 
good night 
welcome iago we must to the watch 
not this hour lieutenant tis not yet ten o the
clock our general cast us thus early for the love
of his desdemona who let us not therefore blame:
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and
she is sport for jove 
she s a most exquisite lady 
and i ll warrant her fun of game 
indeed she s a most fresh and delicate creature 
what an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley of
provocation 
an inviting eye and yet methinks right modest 
and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love 
she is indeed perfection 
well happiness to their sheets come lieutenant i
have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace
of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
the health of black othello 
not to-night good iago: i have very poor and
unhappy brains for drinking: i could well wish
courtesy would invent some other custom of
entertainment 
o they are our friends but one cup: i ll drink for
you 
i have drunk but one cup to-night and that was
craftily qualified too and behold what innovation
it makes here: i am unfortunate in the infirmity 
and dare not task my weakness with any more 
what man tis a night of revels: the gallants
desire it 
where are they 
here at the door i pray you call them in 
i ll do t but it dislikes me 
if i can fasten but one cup upon him 
with that which he hath drunk to-night already 
he ll be as full of quarrel and offence
as my young mistress dog now my sick fool roderigo 
whom love hath turn d almost the wrong side out 
to desdemona hath to-night caroused
potations pottle-deep and he s to watch:
three lads of cyprus noble swelling spirits 
that hold their honours in a wary distance 
the very elements of this warlike isle 
have i to-night fluster d with flowing cups 
and they watch too now mongst this flock of drunkards 
am i to put our cassio in some action
that may offend the isle but here they come:
if consequence do but approve my dream 
my boat sails freely both with wind and stream 
fore god they have given me a rouse already 
good faith a little one not past a pint as i am
a soldier 
some wine ho 
and let me the canakin clink clink 
and let me the canakin clink
a soldier s a man 
a life s but a span 
why then let a soldier drink 
some wine boys 
fore god an excellent song 
i learned it in england where indeed they are
most potent in potting: your dane your german and
your swag-bellied hollander drink ho are nothing
to your english 
is your englishman so expert in his drinking 
why he drinks you with facility your dane dead
drunk he sweats not to overthrow your almain he
gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle
can be filled 
to the health of our general 
i am for it lieutenant and i ll do you justice 
o sweet england 
king stephen was a worthy peer 
his breeches cost him but a crown 
he held them sixpence all too dear 
with that he call d the tailor lown 
he was a wight of high renown 
and thou art but of low degree:
tis pride that pulls the country down 
then take thine auld cloak about thee 
some wine ho 
why this is a more exquisite song than the other 
will you hear t again 
no for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that
does those things well god s above all and there
be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved 
it s true good lieutenant 
for mine own part no offence to the general nor
any man of quality i hope to be saved 
and so do i too lieutenant 
ay but by your leave not before me the
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient let s
have no more of this let s to our affairs forgive
us our sins gentlemen let s look to our business 
do not think gentlemen i am drunk: this is my
ancient this is my right hand and this is my left:
i am not drunk now i can stand well enough and
speak well enough 
all
excellent well 
why very well then you must not think then that i am drunk 
exit
to the platform masters come let s set the watch 
you see this fellow that is gone before 
he is a soldier fit to stand by caesar
and give direction: and do but see his vice 
tis to his virtue a just equinox 
the one as long as the other: tis pity of him 
i fear the trust othello puts him in 
on some odd time of his infirmity 
will shake this island 
but is he often thus 
tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:
he ll watch the horologe a double set 
if drink rock not his cradle 
it were well
the general were put in mind of it 
perhaps he sees it not or his good nature
prizes the virtue that appears in cassio 
and looks not on his evils: is not this true 
how now roderigo 
i pray you after the lieutenant go 
and tis great pity that the noble moor
should hazard such a place as his own second
with one of an ingraft infirmity:
it were an honest action to say
so to the moor 
not i for this fair island:
i do love cassio well and would do much
to cure him of this evil but hark what noise 
you rogue you rascal 
what s the matter lieutenant 
a knave teach me my duty 
i ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle 
beat me 
dost thou prate rogue 
nay good lieutenant 
i pray you sir hold your hand 
let me go sir 
or i ll knock you o er the mazzard 
come come 
you re drunk 
drunk 
away i say go out and cry a mutiny 
nay good lieutenant alas gentlemen 
help ho lieutenant sir montano sir 
help masters here s a goodly watch indeed 
who s that which rings the bell diablo ho 
the town will rise: god s will lieutenant hold 
you will be shamed for ever 
what is the matter here 
zounds i bleed still i am hurt to the death 
hold for your lives 
hold ho lieutenant sir montano gentlemen 
have you forgot all sense of place and duty 
hold the general speaks to you hold hold for shame 
why how now ho from whence ariseth this 
are we turn d turks and to ourselves do that
which heaven hath forbid the ottomites 
for christian shame put by this barbarous brawl:
he that stirs next to carve for his own rage
holds his soul light he dies upon his motion 
silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
from her propriety what is the matter masters 
honest iago that look st dead with grieving 
speak who began this on thy love i charge thee 
i do not know: friends all but now even now 
in quarter and in terms like bride and groom
devesting them for bed and then but now 
as if some planet had unwitted men 
swords out and tilting one at other s breast 
in opposition bloody i cannot speak
any beginning to this peevish odds 
and would in action glorious i had lost
those legs that brought me to a part of it 
how comes it michael you are thus forgot 
i pray you pardon me i cannot speak 
worthy montano you were wont be civil 
the gravity and stillness of your youth
the world hath noted and your name is great
in mouths of wisest censure: what s the matter 
that you unlace your reputation thus
and spend your rich opinion for the name
of a night-brawler give me answer to it 
worthy othello i am hurt to danger:
your officer iago can inform you 
while i spare speech which something now
offends me 
of all that i do know: nor know i aught
by me that s said or done amiss this night 
unless self-charity be sometimes a vice 
and to defend ourselves it be a sin
when violence assails us 
now by heaven 
my blood begins my safer guides to rule 
and passion having my best judgment collied 
assays to lead the way: if i once stir 
or do but lift this arm the best of you
shall sink in my rebuke give me to know
how this foul rout began who set it on 
and he that is approved in this offence 
though he had twinn d with me both at a birth 
shall lose me what in a town of war 
yet wild the people s hearts brimful of fear 
to manage private and domestic quarrel 
in night and on the court and guard of safety 
tis monstrous iago who began t 
if partially affined or leagued in office 
thou dost deliver more or less than truth 
thou art no soldier 
touch me not so near:
i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
than it should do offence to michael cassio 
yet i persuade myself to speak the truth
shall nothing wrong him thus it is general 
montano and myself being in speech 
there comes a fellow crying out for help:
and cassio following him with determined sword 
to execute upon him sir this gentleman
steps in to cassio and entreats his pause:
myself the crying fellow did pursue 
lest by his clamour as it so fell out 
the town might fall in fright: he swift of foot 
outran my purpose and i return d the rather
for that i heard the clink and fall of swords 
and cassio high in oath which till to-night
i ne er might say before when i came back 
for this was brief i found them close together 
at blow and thrust even as again they were
when you yourself did part them 
more of this matter cannot i report:
but men are men the best sometimes forget:
though cassio did some little wrong to him 
as men in rage strike those that wish them best 
yet surely cassio i believe received
from him that fled some strange indignity 
which patience could not pass 
i know iago 
thy honesty and love doth mince this matter 
making it light to cassio cassio i love thee
but never more be officer of mine 
look if my gentle love be not raised up 
i ll make thee an example 
all s well now sweeting come away to bed 
sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon:
lead him off 
iago look with care about the town 
and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted 
come desdemona: tis the soldiers life
to have their balmy slumbers waked with strife 
what are you hurt lieutenant 
ay past all surgery 
marry heaven forbid 
reputation reputation reputation o i have lost
my reputation i have lost the immortal part of
myself and what remains is bestial my reputation 
iago my reputation 
as i am an honest man i thought you had received
some bodily wound there is more sense in that than
in reputation reputation is an idle and most false
imposition: oft got without merit and lost without
deserving: you have lost no reputation at all 
unless you repute yourself such a loser what man 
there are ways to recover the general again: you
are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in
policy than in malice even so as one would beat his
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
to him again and he s yours 
i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
good a commander with so slight so drunken and so
indiscreet an officer drunk and speak parrot 
and squabble swagger swear and discourse
fustian with one s own shadow o thou invisible
spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by 
let us call thee devil 
what was he that you followed with your sword what
had he done to you 
i know not 
is t possible 
i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly 
a quarrel but nothing wherefore o god that men
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
their brains that we should with joy pleasance
revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts 
why but you are now well enough: how came you thus
recovered 
it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me
another to make me frankly despise myself 
come you are too severe a moraler: as the time 
the place and the condition of this country
stands i could heartily wish this had not befallen 
but since it is as it is mend it for your own good 
i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me
i am a drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra 
such an answer would stop them all to be now a
sensible man by and by a fool and presently a
beast o strange every inordinate cup is
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil 
come come good wine is a good familiar creature 
if it be well used: exclaim no more against it 
and good lieutenant i think you think i love you 
i have well approved it sir i drunk 
you or any man living may be drunk at a time man 
i ll tell you what you shall do our general s wife
is now the general: may say so in this respect for
that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and
graces: confess yourself freely to her importune
her help to put you in your place again: she is of
so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition 
she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
than she is requested: this broken joint between
you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my
fortunes against any lay worth naming this
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before 
you advise me well 
i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness 
i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will
beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me:
i am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here 
you are in the right good night lieutenant i
must to the watch 
good night honest iago 
and what s he then that says i play the villain 
when this advice is free i give and honest 
probal to thinking and indeed the course
to win the moor again for tis most easy
the inclining desdemona to subdue
in any honest suit: she s framed as fruitful
as the free elements and then for her
to win the moor were t to renounce his baptism 
all seals and symbols of redeemed sin 
his soul is so enfetter d to her love 
that she may make unmake do what she list 
even as her appetite shall play the god
with his weak function how am i then a villain
to counsel cassio to this parallel course 
directly to his good divinity of hell 
when devils will the blackest sins put on 
they do suggest at first with heavenly shows 
as i do now: for whiles this honest fool
plies desdemona to repair his fortunes
and she for him pleads strongly to the moor 
i ll pour this pestilence into his ear 
that she repeals him for her body s lust 
and by how much she strives to do him good 
she shall undo her credit with the moor 
so will i turn her virtue into pitch 
and out of her own goodness make the net
that shall enmesh them all 
how now roderigo 
i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that
hunts but one that fills up the cry my money is
almost spent i have been to-night exceedingly well
cudgelled and i think the issue will be i shall
have so much experience for my pains and so with
no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice 
how poor are they that have not patience 
what wound did ever heal but by degrees 
thou know st we work by wit and not by witchcraft 
and wit depends on dilatory time 
does t not go well cassio hath beaten thee 
and thou by that small hurt hast cashier d cassio:
though other things grow fair against the sun 
yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
content thyself awhile by the mass tis morning 
pleasure and action make the hours seem short 
retire thee go where thou art billeted:
away i say thou shalt know more hereafter:
nay get thee gone 
two things are to be done:
my wife must move for cassio to her mistress 
i ll set her on 
myself the while to draw the moor apart 
and bring him jump when he may cassio find
soliciting his wife: ay that s the way
dull not device by coldness and delay 
masters play here i will content your pains 
something that s brief and bid good morrow general 	
why masters have your instruments been in naples 
that they speak i the nose thus 
how sir how 
are these i pray you wind-instruments 
ay marry are they sir 
o thereby hangs a tail 
whereby hangs a tale sir 
marry sir by many a wind-instrument that i know 
but masters here s money for you: and the general
so likes your music that he desires you for love s
sake to make no more noise with it 
well sir we will not 
if you have any music that may not be heard to t
again: but as they say to hear music the general
does not greatly care 
we have none such sir 
then put up your pipes in your bag for i ll away:
go vanish into air away 
dost thou hear my honest friend 
no i hear not your honest friend i hear you 
prithee keep up thy quillets there s a poor piece
of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends
the general s wife be stirring tell her there s
one cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:
wilt thou do this 
she is stirring sir: if she will stir hither i
shall seem to notify unto her 
do good my friend 
in happy time iago 
you have not been a-bed then 
why no the day had broke
before we parted i have made bold iago 
to send in to your wife: my suit to her
is that she will to virtuous desdemona
procure me some access 
i ll send her to you presently 
and i ll devise a mean to draw the moor
out of the way that your converse and business
may be more free 
i humbly thank you for t 
i never knew
a florentine more kind and honest 
yet i beseech you 
if you think fit or that it may be done 
give me advantage of some brief discourse
with desdemona alone 
i am much bound to you 
these letters give iago to the pilot 
and by him do my duties to the senate:
that done i will be walking on the works 
repair there to me 
well my good lord i ll do t 
this fortification gentlemen shall we see t 
gentleman
we ll wait upon your lordship 
bounteous madam 
whatever shall become of michael cassio 
he s never any thing but your true servant 
ay but lady 
that policy may either last so long 
or feed upon such nice and waterish diet 
or breed itself so out of circumstance 
that i being absent and my place supplied 
my general will forget my love and service 
madam i ll take my leave 
madam not now: i am very ill at ease 
unfit for mine own purposes 
ha i like not that 
what dost thou say 
nothing my lord: or if i know not what 
was not that cassio parted from my wife 
cassio my lord no sure i cannot think it 
that he would steal away so guilty-like 
seeing you coming 
i do believe twas he 
who is t you mean 
went he hence now 
not now sweet desdemona some other time 
the sooner sweet for you 
no not to-night 
i shall not dine at home 
i meet the captains at the citadel 
prithee no more: let him come when he will 
i will deny thee nothing 
i will deny thee nothing:
whereon i do beseech thee grant me this 
to leave me but a little to myself 
farewell my desdemona: i ll come to thee straight 
excellent wretch perdition catch my soul 
but i do love thee and when i love thee not 
chaos is come again 
my noble lord 
what dost thou say iago 
did michael cassio when you woo d my lady 
know of your love 
he did from first to last: why dost thou ask 
but for a satisfaction of my thought 
no further harm 
why of thy thought iago 
i did not think he had been acquainted with her 
o yes and went between us very oft 
indeed 
indeed ay indeed: discern st thou aught in that 
is he not honest 
honest my lord 
honest ay honest 
my lord for aught i know 
what dost thou think 
think my lord 
think my lord 
by heaven he echoes me 
as if there were some monster in his thought
too hideous to be shown thou dost mean something:
i heard thee say even now thou likedst not that 
when cassio left my wife: what didst not like 
and when i told thee he was of my counsel
in my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeed 
and didst contract and purse thy brow together 
as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me 
show me thy thought 
my lord you know i love you 
i think thou dost 
and for i know thou rt full of love and honesty 
and weigh st thy words before thou givest them breath 
therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
for such things in a false disloyal knave
are tricks of custom but in a man that s just
they are close delations working from the heart
that passion cannot rule 
for michael cassio 
i dare be sworn i think that he is honest 
i think so too 
men should be what they seem 
or those that be not would they might seem none 
certain men should be what they seem 
why then i think cassio s an honest man 
nay yet there s more in this:
i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings 
as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts
the worst of words 
good my lord pardon me:
though i am bound to every act of duty 
i am not bound to that all slaves are free to 
utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false 
as where s that palace whereinto foul things
sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure 
but some uncleanly apprehensions
keep leets and law-days and in session sit
with meditations lawful 
thou dost conspire against thy friend iago 
if thou but think st him wrong d and makest his ear
a stranger to thy thoughts 
i do beseech you 
though i perchance am vicious in my guess 
as i confess it is my nature s plague
to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy
shapes faults that are not that your wisdom yet 
from one that so imperfectly conceits 
would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble
out of his scattering and unsure observance 
it were not for your quiet nor your good 
nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom 
to let you know my thoughts 
what dost thou mean 
good name in man and woman dear my lord 
is the immediate jewel of their souls:
who steals my purse steals trash tis something nothing 
twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands:
but he that filches from me my good name
robs me of that which not enriches him
and makes me poor indeed 
by heaven i ll know thy thoughts 
you cannot if my heart were in your hand 
nor shall not whilst tis in my custody 
ha 
o beware my lord of jealousy 
it is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss
who certain of his fate loves not his wronger 
but o what damned minutes tells he o er
who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves 
o misery 
poor and content is rich and rich enough 
but riches fineless is as poor as winter
to him that ever fears he shall be poor 
good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend
from jealousy 
why why is this 
think st thou i ld make a lie of jealousy 
to follow still the changes of the moon
with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt
is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat 
when i shall turn the business of my soul
to such exsufflicate and blown surmises 
matching thy inference tis not to make me jealous
to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company 
is free of speech sings plays and dances well 
where virtue is these are more virtuous:
nor from mine own weak merits will i draw
the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt 
for she had eyes and chose me no iago 
i ll see before i doubt when i doubt prove 
and on the proof there is no more but this 
away at once with love or jealousy 
i am glad of it for now i shall have reason
to show the love and duty that i bear you
with franker spirit: therefore as i am bound 
receive it from me i speak not yet of proof 
look to your wife observe her well with cassio 
wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure:
i would not have your free and noble nature 
out of self-bounty be abused look to t:
i know our country disposition well 
in venice they do let heaven see the pranks
they dare not show their husbands their best conscience
is not to leave t undone but keep t unknown 
dost thou say so 
she did deceive her father marrying you 
and when she seem d to shake and fear your looks 
she loved them most 
and so she did 
why go to then 
she that so young could give out such a seeming 
to seal her father s eyes up close as oak-
he thought twas witchcraft but i am much to blame 
i humbly do beseech you of your pardon
for too much loving you 
i am bound to thee for ever 
i see this hath a little dash d your spirits 
not a jot not a jot 
i faith i fear it has 
i hope you will consider what is spoke
comes from my love but i do see you re moved:
i am to pray you not to strain my speech
to grosser issues nor to larger reach
than to suspicion 
i will not 
should you do so my lord 
my speech should fall into such vile success
as my thoughts aim not at cassio s my worthy friend 
my lord i see you re moved 
no not much moved:
i do not think but desdemona s honest 
long live she so and long live you to think so 
and yet how nature erring from itself 
ay there s the point: as to be bold with you 
not to affect many proposed matches
of her own clime complexion and degree 
whereto we see in all things nature tends 
foh one may smell in such a will most rank 
foul disproportion thoughts unnatural 
but pardon me i do not in position
distinctly speak of her though i may fear
her will recoiling to her better judgment 
may fall to match you with her country forms
and happily repent 
farewell farewell:
if more thou dost perceive let me know more 
set on thy wife to observe: leave me iago:
my lord i take my leave 
why did i marry this honest creature doubtless
sees and knows more much more than he unfolds 
my lord i would i might entreat
your honour
to scan this thing no further leave it to time:
though it be fit that cassio have his place 
for sure he fills it up with great ability 
yet if you please to hold him off awhile 
you shall by that perceive him and his means:
note if your lady strain his entertainment
with any strong or vehement importunity 
much will be seen in that in the mean time 
let me be thought too busy in my fears 
as worthy cause i have to fear i am 
and hold her free i do beseech your honour 
fear not my government 
i once more take my leave 
this fellow s of exceeding honesty 
and knows all qualities with a learned spirit 
of human dealings if i do prove her haggard 
though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings 
i ld whistle her off and let her down the wind 
to pray at fortune haply for i am black
and have not those soft parts of conversation
that chamberers have or for i am declined
into the vale of years yet that s not much 
she s gone i am abused and my relief
must be to loathe her o curse of marriage 
that we can call these delicate creatures ours 
and not their appetites i had rather be a toad 
and live upon the vapour of a dungeon 
than keep a corner in the thing i love
for others uses yet tis the plague of great ones 
prerogatived are they less than the base 
tis destiny unshunnable like death:
even then this forked plague is fated to us
when we do quicken desdemona comes:
if she be false o then heaven mocks itself 
i ll not believe t 
i am to blame 
i have a pain upon my forehead here 
your napkin is too little:
let it alone come i ll go in with you 
how now what do you here alone 
a thing for me it is a common thing 
to have a foolish wife 
what handkerchief 
hast stol n it from her 
a good wench give it me 
[snatching it] why what s that to you 
be not acknown on t i have use for it 
go leave me 
i will in cassio s lodging lose this napkin 
and let him find it trifles light as air
are to the jealous confirmations strong
as proofs of holy writ: this may do something 
the moor already changes with my poison:
dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons 
which at the first are scarce found to distaste 
but with a little act upon the blood 
burn like the mines of sulphur i did say so:
look where he comes 
not poppy nor mandragora 
nor all the drowsy syrups of the world 
shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
which thou owedst yesterday 
ha ha false to me 
why how now general no more of that 
avaunt be gone thou hast set me on the rack:
i swear tis better to be much abused
than but to know t a little 
how now my lord 
what sense had i of her stol n hours of lust 
i saw t not thought it not it harm d not me:
i slept the next night well was free and merry 
i found not cassio s kisses on her lips:
he that is robb d not wanting what is stol n 
let him not know t and he s not robb d at all 
i am sorry to hear this 
i had been happy if the general camp 
pioners and all had tasted her sweet body 
so i had nothing known o now for ever
farewell the tranquil mind farewell content 
farewell the plumed troop and the big wars 
that make ambition virtue o farewell 
farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump 
the spirit-stirring drum the ear-piercing fife 
the royal banner and all quality 
pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war 
and o you mortal engines whose rude throats
the immortal jove s dead clamours counterfeit 
farewell othello s occupation s gone 
is t possible my lord 
villain be sure thou prove my love a whore 
be sure of it give me the ocular proof:
or by the worth of man s eternal soul 
thou hadst been better have been born a dog
than answer my waked wrath 
is t come to this 
make me to see t or at the least so prove it 
that the probation bear no hinge nor loop
to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life 
my noble lord 
if thou dost slander her and torture me 
never pray more abandon all remorse 
on horror s head horrors accumulate 
do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed 
for nothing canst thou to damnation add
greater than that 
o grace o heaven forgive me 
are you a man have you a soul or sense 
god be wi you take mine office o wretched fool 
that livest to make thine honesty a vice 
o monstrous world take note take note o world 
to be direct and honest is not safe 
i thank you for this profit and from hence
i ll love no friend sith love breeds such offence 
nay stay: thou shouldst be honest 
i should be wise for honesty s a fool
and loses that it works for 
by the world 
i think my wife be honest and think she is not 
i think that thou art just and think thou art not 
i ll have some proof her name that was as fresh
as dian s visage is now begrimed and black
as mine own face if there be cords or knives 
poison or fire or suffocating streams 
i ll not endure it would i were satisfied 
i see sir you are eaten up with passion:
i do repent me that i put it to you 
you would be satisfied 
would nay i will 
and may: but how how satisfied my lord 
would you the supervisor grossly gape on 
behold her topp d 
death and damnation o 
it were a tedious difficulty i think 
to bring them to that prospect: damn them then 
if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
more than their own what then how then 
what shall i say where s satisfaction 
it is impossible you should see this 
were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys 
as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross
as ignorance made drunk but yet i say 
if imputation and strong circumstances 
which lead directly to the door of truth 
will give you satisfaction you may have t 
give me a living reason she s disloyal 
i do not like the office:
but sith i am enter d in this cause so far 
prick d to t by foolish honesty and love 
i will go on i lay with cassio lately 
and being troubled with a raging tooth 
i could not sleep 
there are a kind of men so loose of soul 
that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
one of this kind is cassio:
in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona 
let us be wary let us hide our loves 
and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand 
cry o sweet creature and then kiss me hard 
as if he pluck d up kisses by the roots
that grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
over my thigh and sigh d and kiss d and then
cried cursed fate that gave thee to the moor 
o monstrous monstrous 
nay this was but his dream 
but this denoted a foregone conclusion:
tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream 
and this may help to thicken other proofs
that do demonstrate thinly 
i ll tear her all to pieces 
nay but be wise: yet we see nothing done 
she may be honest yet tell me but this 
have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
spotted with strawberries in your wife s hand 
i gave her such a one twas my first gift 
i know not that but such a handkerchief 
i am sure it was your wife s did i to-day
see cassio wipe his beard with 
if it be that 
if it be that or any that was hers 
it speaks against her with the other proofs 
o that the slave had forty thousand lives 
one is too poor too weak for my revenge 
now do i see tis true look here iago 
all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven 
tis gone 
arise black vengeance from thy hollow cell 
yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne
to tyrannous hate swell bosom with thy fraught 
for tis of aspics tongues 
yet be content 
o blood blood blood 
patience i say your mind perhaps may change 
never iago: like to the pontic sea 
whose icy current and compulsive course
ne er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on
to the propontic and the hellespont 
even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace 
shall ne er look back ne er ebb to humble love 
till that a capable and wide revenge
swallow them up now by yond marble heaven 
in the due reverence of a sacred vow
i here engage my words 
do not rise yet 
witness you ever-burning lights above 
you elements that clip us round about 
witness that here iago doth give up
the execution of his wit hands heart 
to wrong d othello s service let him command 
and to obey shall be in me remorse 
what bloody business ever 
i greet thy love 
not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous 
and will upon the instant put thee to t:
within these three days let me hear thee say
that cassio s not alive 
my friend is dead tis done at your request:
but let her live 
damn her lewd minx o damn her 
come go with me apart i will withdraw 
to furnish me with some swift means of death
for the fair devil now art thou my lieutenant 
i am your own for ever 
i dare not say he lies any where 
he s a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies 
is stabbing 
to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie 
i know not where he lodges and for me to devise a
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were
to lie in mine own throat 
i will catechise the world for him that is make
questions and by them answer 
to do this is within the compass of man s wit: and
therefore i will attempt the doing it 
well my good lady 
o hardness to dissemble 
how do you desdemona 
give me your hand: this hand is moist my lady 
this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
hot hot and moist: this hand of yours requires
a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer 
much castigation exercise devout 
for here s a young and sweating devil here 
that commonly rebels tis a good hand 
a frank one 
a liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands 
but our new heraldry is hands not hearts 
what promise chuck 
i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me 
lend me thy handkerchief 
that which i gave you 
not 
that is a fault 
that handkerchief
did an egyptian to my mother give 
she was a charmer and could almost read
the thoughts of people: she told her while
she kept it 
twould make her amiable and subdue my father
entirely to her love but if she lost it
or made gift of it my father s eye
should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
after new fancies: she dying gave it me 
and bid me when my fate would have me wive 
to give it her i did so: and take heed on t 
make it a darling like your precious eye 
to lose t or give t away were such perdition
as nothing else could match 
tis true: there s magic in the web of it:
a sibyl that had number d in the world
the sun to course two hundred compasses 
in her prophetic fury sew d the work 
the worms were hallow d that did breed the silk 
and it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
conserved of maidens hearts 
most veritable therefore look to t well 
ha wherefore 
is t lost is t gone speak is it out
o the way 
say you 
how 
fetch t let me see t 
fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives 
the handkerchief 
the handkerchief 
the handkerchief 
away 
there is no other way tis she must do t:
and lo the happiness go and importune her 
madam my former suit: i do beseech you
that by your virtuous means i may again
exist and be a member of his love
whom i with all the office of my heart
entirely honour: i would not be delay d 
if my offence be of such mortal kind
that nor my service past nor present sorrows 
nor purposed merit in futurity 
can ransom me into his love again 
but to know so must be my benefit 
so shall i clothe me in a forced content 
and shut myself up in some other course 
to fortune s alms 
is my lord angry 
can he be angry i have seen the cannon 
when it hath blown his ranks into the air 
and like the devil from his very arm
puff d his own brother: and can he be angry 
something of moment then: i will go meet him:
there s matter in t indeed if he be angry 
i humbly thank your ladyship 
what make you from home 
how is it with you my most fair bianca 
i faith sweet love i was coming to your house 
pardon me bianca:
i have this while with leaden thoughts been press d:
but i shall in a more continuate time 
strike off this score of absence sweet bianca 
take me this work out 
go to woman 
throw your vile guesses in the devil s teeth 
from whence you have them you are jealous now
that this is from some mistress some remembrance:
no in good troth bianca 
i know not sweet: i found it in my chamber 
i like the work well: ere it be demanded 
as like enough it will i ld have it copied:
take it and do t and leave me for this time 
i do attend here on the general 
and think it no addition nor my wish 
to have him see me woman d 
not that i love you not 
tis but a little way that i can bring you 
for i attend here: but i ll see you soon 
will you think so 
think so iago 
what 
to kiss in private 
an unauthorized kiss 
or to be naked with her friend in bed
an hour or more not meaning any harm 
naked in bed iago and not mean harm 
it is hypocrisy against the devil:
they that mean virtuously and yet do so 
the devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven 
so they do nothing tis a venial slip:
but if i give my wife a handkerchief 
what then 
why then tis hers my lord and being hers 
she may i think bestow t on any man 
she is protectress of her honour too:
may she give that 
her honour is an essence that s not seen 
they have it very oft that have it not:
but for the handkerchief 
by heaven i would most gladly have forgot it 
thou said st it comes o er my memory 
as doth the raven o er the infected house 
boding to all he had my handkerchief 
ay what of that 
that s not so good now 
what 
if i had said i had seen him do you wrong 
or heard him say as knaves be such abroad 
who having by their own importunate suit 
or voluntary dotage of some mistress 
convinced or supplied them cannot choose
but they must blab 
hath he said any thing 
he hath my lord but be you well assured 
no more than he ll unswear 
what hath he said 
faith that he did i know not what he did 
what what 
lie 
with her 
with her on her what you will 
lie with her lie on her we say lie on her when
they belie her lie with her that s fulsome 
handkerchief confessions handkerchief to
confess and be hanged for his labour first to be
hanged and then to confess i tremble at it 
nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
passion without some instruction it is not words
that shake me thus pish noses ears and lips 
is t possible confess handkerchief o devil 
work on 
my medicine work thus credulous fools are caught 
and many worthy and chaste dames even thus 
all guiltless meet reproach what ho my lord 
my lord i say othello 
how now cassio 
what s the matter 
my lord is fall n into an epilepsy:
this is his second fit he had one yesterday 
rub him about the temples 
no forbear 
the lethargy must have his quiet course:
if not he foams at mouth and by and by
breaks out to savage madness look he stirs:
do you withdraw yourself a little while 
he will recover straight: when he is gone 
i would on great occasion speak with you 
how is it general have you not hurt your head 
dost thou mock me 
i mock you no by heaven 
would you would bear your fortune like a man 
a horned man s a monster and a beast 
there s many a beast then in a populous city 
and many a civil monster 
did he confess it 
good sir be a man 
think every bearded fellow that s but yoked
may draw with you: there s millions now alive
that nightly lie in those unproper beds
which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better 
o tis the spite of hell the fiend s arch-mock 
to lip a wanton in a secure couch 
and to suppose her chaste no let me know 
and knowing what i am i know what she shall be 
o thou art wise tis certain 
stand you awhile apart 
confine yourself but in a patient list 
whilst you were here o erwhelmed with your grief 
a passion most unsuiting such a man 
cassio came hither: i shifted him away 
and laid good scuse upon your ecstasy 
bade him anon return and here speak with me 
the which he promised do but encave yourself 
and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns 
that dwell in every region of his face 
for i will make him tell the tale anew 
where how how oft how long ago and when
he hath and is again to cope your wife:
i say but mark his gesture marry patience 
or i shall say you are all in all in spleen 
and nothing of a man 
dost thou hear iago 
i will be found most cunning in my patience 
but dost thou hear most bloody 
that s not amiss 
but yet keep time in all will you withdraw 
now will i question cassio of bianca 
a housewife that by selling her desires
buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
that dotes on cassio as tis the strumpet s plague
to beguile many and be beguiled by one:
he when he hears of her cannot refrain
from the excess of laughter here he comes:
as he shall smile othello shall go mad 
and his unbookish jealousy must construe
poor cassio s smiles gestures and light behavior 
quite in the wrong how do you now lieutenant 
the worser that you give me the addition
whose want even kills me 
ply desdemona well and you are sure on t 
now if this suit lay in bianco s power 
how quickly should you speed 
alas poor caitiff 
look how he laughs already 
i never knew woman love man so 
alas poor rogue i think i faith she loves me 
now he denies it faintly and laughs it out 
do you hear cassio 
now he importunes him
to tell it o er: go to well said well said 
she gives it out that you shall marry hey:
do you intend it 
ha ha ha 
do you triumph roman do you triumph 
i marry her what a customer prithee bear some
charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome 
ha ha ha 
so so so so: they laugh that win 
faith the cry goes that you shall marry her 
prithee say true 
i am a very villain else 
have you scored me well 
this is the monkey s own giving out: she is
persuaded i will marry her out of her own love and
flattery not out of my promise 
iago beckons me now he begins the story 
she was here even now she haunts me in every place 
i was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
certain venetians and thither comes the bauble 
and by this hand she falls me thus about my neck 
crying o dear cassio as it were: his gesture
imports it 
so hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so hales 
and pulls me: ha ha ha 
now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber o 
i see that nose of yours but not that dog i shall
throw it to 
well i must leave her company 
before me look where she comes 
tis such another fitchew marry a perfumed one 
what do you mean by this haunting of me 
how now my sweet bianca how now how now 
by heaven that should be my handkerchief 
after her after her 
faith i must she ll rail in the street else 
will you sup there 
faith i intend so 
well i may chance to see you for i would very fain
speak with you 
prithee come will you 
go to say no more 
[advancing] how shall i murder him iago 
did you perceive how he laughed at his vice 
o iago 
and did you see the handkerchief 
was that mine 
yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the
foolish woman your wife she gave it him and he
hath given it his whore 
i would have him nine years a-killing 
a fine woman a fair woman a sweet woman 
nay you must forget that 
ay let her rot and perish and be damned to-night 
for she shall not live: no my heart is turned to
stone i strike it and it hurts my hand o the
world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by
an emperor s side and command him tasks 
nay that s not your way 
hang her i do but say what she is: so delicate
with her needle: an admirable musician: o she
will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high
and plenteous wit and invention: 
she s the worse for all this 
o a thousand thousand times: and then of so
gentle a condition 
ay too gentle 
nay that s certain: but yet the pity of it iago 
o iago the pity of it iago 
if you are so fond over her iniquity give her
patent to offend for if it touch not you it comes
near nobody 
i will chop her into messes: cuckold me 
o tis foul in her 
with mine officer 
that s fouler 
get me some poison iago this night: i ll not
expostulate with her lest her body and beauty
unprovide my mind again: this night iago 
do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even
the bed she hath contaminated 
good good: the justice of it pleases: very good 
and for cassio let me be his undertaker: you
shall hear more by midnight 
excellent good 
what trumpet is that same 
something from venice sure tis lodovico
come from the duke: and see your wife is with him 
save you worthy general 
with all my heart sir 
the duke and senators of venice greet you 
i kiss the instrument of their pleasures 
i am very glad to see you signior
welcome to cyprus 
i thank you how does lieutenant cassio 
lives sir 
are you sure of that 
this fail you not to do as you will 
he did not call he s busy in the paper 
is there division twixt my lord and cassio 
fire and brimstone 
are you wise 
may be the letter moved him 
for as i think they do command him home 
deputing cassio in his government 
indeed 
i am glad to see you mad 
[striking her] devil 
my lord this would not be believed in venice 
though i should swear i saw t: tis very much:
make her amends she weeps 
o devil devil 
if that the earth could teem with woman s tears 
each drop she falls would prove a crocodile 
out of my sight 
truly an obedient lady:
i do beseech your lordship call her back 
mistress 
what would you with her sir 
who i my lord 
ay you did wish that i would make her turn:
sir she can turn and turn and yet go on 
and turn again and she can weep sir weep 
and she s obedient as you say obedient 
very obedient proceed you in your tears 
concerning this sir o well-painted passion 
i am commanded home get you away 
i ll send for you anon sir i obey the mandate 
and will return to venice hence avaunt 
cassio shall have my place and sir tonight 
i do entreat that we may sup together:
you are welcome sir to cyprus goats and monkeys 
is this the noble moor whom our full senate
call all in all sufficient is this the nature
whom passion could not shake whose solid virtue
the shot of accident nor dart of chance 
could neither graze nor pierce 
he is much changed 
are his wits safe is he not light of brain 
he s that he is: i may not breathe my censure
what he might be: if what he might he is not 
i would to heaven he were 
what strike his wife 
faith that was not so well yet would i knew
that stroke would prove the worst 
is it his use 
or did the letters work upon his blood 
and new-create this fault 
alas alas 
it is not honesty in me to speak
what i have seen and known you shall observe him 
and his own courses will denote him so
that i may save my speech: do but go after 
and mark how he continues 
i am sorry that i am deceived in him 
you have seen nothing then 
yes you have seen cassio and she together 
what did they never whisper 
nor send you out o the way 
to fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing 
that s strange 
bid her come hither: go 
she says enough yet she s a simple bawd
that cannot say as much this is a subtle whore 
a closet lock and key of villanous secrets
and yet she ll kneel and pray i have seen her do t 
pray chuck come hither 
let me see your eyes 
look in my face 
some of your function mistress 
leave procreants alone and shut the door 
cough or cry hem if any body come:
your mystery your mystery: nay dispatch 
why what art thou 
come swear it damn thyself
lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves
should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn d:
swear thou art honest 
heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell 
o desdemona away away away 
had it pleased heaven
to try me with affliction had they rain d
all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head 
steep d me in poverty to the very lips 
given to captivity me and my utmost hopes 
i should have found in some place of my soul
a drop of patience: but alas to make me
a fixed figure for the time of scorn
to point his slow unmoving finger at 
yet could i bear that too well very well:
but there where i have garner d up my heart 
where either i must live or bear no life 
the fountain from the which my current runs 
or else dries up to be discarded thence 
or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
to knot and gender in turn thy complexion there 
patience thou young and rose-lipp d cherubin 
ay there look grim as hell 
o ay as summer flies are in the shambles 
that quicken even with blowing o thou weed 
who art so lovely fair and smell st so sweet
that the sense aches at thee would thou hadst
ne er been born 
was this fair paper this most goodly book 
made to write whore upon what committed 
committed o thou public commoner 
i should make very forges of my cheeks 
that would to cinders burn up modesty 
did i but speak thy deeds what committed 
heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks 
the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
is hush d within the hollow mine of earth 
and will not hear it what committed 
impudent strumpet 
are you not a strumpet 
what not a whore 
is t possible 
i cry you mercy then:
i took you for that cunning whore of venice
that married with othello 
you mistress 
that have the office opposite to saint peter 
and keep the gate of hell 
you you ay you 
we have done our course there s money for your pains:
i pray you turn the key and keep our counsel 
what is your pleasure madam 
how is t with you 
what s the matter lady 
what name fair lady 
why did he so 
do not weep do not weep alas the day 
beshrew him for t 
how comes this trick upon him 
fie there is no such man it is impossible 
speak within door 
you are a fool go to 
i pray you be content tis but his humour:
the business of the state does him offence 
and he does chide with you 
tis but so i warrant 
hark how these instruments summon to supper 
the messengers of venice stay the meat 
go in and weep not all things shall be well 
how now roderigo 
i do not find that thou dealest justly with me 
what in the contrary 
every day thou daffest me with some device iago 
and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me
all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
advantage of hope i will indeed no longer endure
it nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace what
already i have foolishly suffered 
will you hear me roderigo 
faith i have heard too much for your words and
performances are no kin together 
you charge me most unjustly 
with nought but truth i have wasted myself out of
my means the jewels you have had from me to
deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a
votarist: you have told me she hath received them
and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
respect and acquaintance but i find none 
well go to very well 
very well go to i cannot go to man nor tis
not very well: nay i think it is scurvy and begin
to find myself fobbed in it 
very well 
i tell you tis not very well i will make myself
known to desdemona: if she will return me my
jewels i will give over my suit and repent my
unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself i
will seek satisfaction of you 
you have said now 
ay and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing 
why now i see there s mettle in thee and even from
this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
ever before give me thy hand roderigo: thou hast
taken against me a most just exception but yet i
protest i have dealt most directly in thy affair 
it hath not appeared 
i grant indeed it hath not appeared and your
suspicion is not without wit and judgment but 
roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which i
have greater reason to believe now than ever i mean
purpose courage and valour this night show it: if
thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona 
take me from this world with treachery and devise
engines for my life 
well what is it is it within reason and compass 
sir there is especial commission come from venice
to depute cassio in othello s place 
is that true why then othello and desdemona
return again to venice 
o no he goes into mauritania and takes away with
him the fair desdemona unless his abode be
lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
so determinate as the removing of cassio 
how do you mean removing of him 
why by making him uncapable of othello s place 
knocking out his brains 
and that you would have me to do 
ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right 
he sups to-night with a harlotry and thither will i
go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
fortune if you will watch his going thence which
i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one 
you may take him at your pleasure: i will be near
to second your attempt and he shall fall between
us come stand not amazed at it but go along with
me i will show you such a necessity in his death
that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
him it is now high suppertime and the night grows
to waste: about it 
i will hear further reason for this 
and you shall be satisfied 
i do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further 
o pardon me: twill do me good to walk 
madam good night i humbly thank your ladyship 
will you walk sir 
o desdemona 
get you to bed on the instant i will be returned
forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done 
here stand behind this bulk straight will he come:
wear thy good rapier bare and put it home:
quick quick fear nothing i ll be at thy elbow:
it makes us or it mars us think on that 
and fix most firm thy resolution 
be near at hand i may miscarry in t 
here at thy hand: be bold and take thy stand 
i have no great devotion to the deed 
and yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:
tis but a man gone forth my sword: he dies 
i have rubb d this young quat almost to the sense 
and he grows angry now whether he kill cassio 
or cassio him or each do kill the other 
every way makes my gain: live roderigo 
he calls me to a restitution large
of gold and jewels that i bobb d from him 
as gifts to desdemona 
it must not be: if cassio do remain 
he hath a daily beauty in his life
that makes me ugly and besides the moor
may unfold me to him there stand i in much peril:
no he must die but so: i hear him coming 
i know his gait tis he villain thou diest 
that thrust had been mine enemy indeed 
but that my coat is better than thou know st
i will make proof of thine 
o i am slain 
i am maim d for ever help ho murder murder 
the voice of cassio: iago keeps his word 
o villain that i am 
it is even so 
o help ho light a surgeon 
tis he: o brave iago honest and just 
that hast such noble sense of thy friend s wrong 
thou teachest me minion your dear lies dead 
and your unblest fate hies: strumpet i come 
forth of my heart those charms thine eyes are blotted 
thy bed lust-stain d shall with lust s blood be spotted 
what ho no watch no passage murder murder 
tis some mischance the cry is very direful 
o help 
hark 
o wretched villain 
two or three groan: it is a heavy night:
these may be counterfeits: let s think t unsafe
to come in to the cry without more help 
nobody come then shall i bleed to death 
hark 
here s one comes in his shirt with light and weapons 
who s there whose noise is this that ones on murder 
we do not know 
did not you hear a cry 
here here for heaven s sake help me 
what s the matter

the same indeed a very valiant fellow 
what are you here that cry so grievously 
iago o i am spoil d undone by villains

o me lieutenant what villains have done this 
i think that one of them is hereabout 
and cannot make away

do you see gentlemen nay guiltiness will speak 
though tongues were out of use 
cassio hath here been set on in the dark
by roderigo and fellows that are scaped:
he s almost slain and roderigo dead 
this is the fruit of whoring prithee emilia 
go know of cassio where he supp d to-night 
what do you shake at that 
o did he so i charge you go with me 
kind gentlemen let s go see poor cassio dress d 
come mistress you must tell s another tale 
emilia run you to the citadel 
and tell my lord and lady what hath happ d 
will you go on i pray 
this is the night
that either makes me or fordoes me quite 
it is the cause it is the cause my soul 
let me not name it to you you chaste stars 
it is the cause yet i ll not shed her blood 
nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow 
and smooth as monumental alabaster 
yet she must die else she ll betray more men 
put out the light and then put out the light:
if i quench thee thou flaming minister 
i can again thy former light restore 
should i repent me: but once put out thy light 
thou cunning st pattern of excelling nature 
i know not where is that promethean heat
that can thy light relume when i have pluck d the rose 
i cannot give it vital growth again 
it must needs wither: i ll smell it on the tree 
ah balmy breath that dost almost persuade
justice to break her sword one more one more 
be thus when thou art dead and i will kill thee 
and love thee after one more and this the last:
so sweet was ne er so fatal i must weep 
but they are cruel tears: this sorrow s heavenly 
it strikes where it doth love she wakes 
ay desdemona 
have you pray d to-night desdemona 
if you bethink yourself of any crime
unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace 
solicit for it straight 
well do it and be brief i will walk by:
i would not kill thy unprepared spirit 
no heaven forfend i would not kill thy soul 
ay i do 
amen with all my heart 
hum 
think on thy sins 
ay and for that thou diest 
peace and be still 
that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee
thou gavest to cassio 
sweet soul take heed 
take heed of perjury thou art on thy deathbed 
yes presently:
therefore confess thee freely of thy sin 
for to deny each article with oath
cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
that i do groan withal thou art to die 
i say amen 
by heaven i saw my handkerchief in s hand 
o perjured woman thou dost stone my heart 
and makest me call what i intend to do
a murder which i thought a sacrifice:
i saw the handkerchief 
he hath confess d 
that he hath used thee 
ay 
no his mouth is stopp d 
honest iago hath ta en order for t 
had all his hairs been lives my great revenge
had stomach for them all 
out strumpet weep st thou for him to my face 
down strumpet 
nay if you strive 
being done there is no pause 
it is too late 
what noise is this not dead not yet quite dead 
i that am cruel am yet merciful 
i would not have thee linger in thy pain: so so 
who s there 
yes: tis emilia by and by she s dead 
tis like she comes to speak of cassio s death 
the noise was here ha no more moving 
still as the grave shall she come in were t good 
i think she stirs again: no what s best to do 
if she come in she ll sure speak to my wife:
my wife my wife what wife i have no wife 
o insupportable o heavy hour 
methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe
should yawn at alteration 
i had forgot thee: o come in emilia 
soft by and by let me the curtains draw 
where art thou 
what s the matter with thee now 
what now 
it is the very error of the moon 
she comes more nearer earth than she was wont 
and makes men mad 
roderigo kill d 
and cassio kill d 
not cassio kill d then murder s out of tune 
and sweet revenge grows harsh 
that what 
why how should she be murder d 
you heard her say herself it was not i 
she s like a liar gone to burning hell:
twas i that kill d her 
she turn d to folly and she was a whore 
she was false as water 
cassio did top her ask thy husband else 
o i were damn d beneath all depth in hell 
but that i did proceed upon just grounds
to this extremity thy husband knew it all 
thy husband 
ay with cassio nay had she been true 
if heaven would make me such another world
of one entire and perfect chrysolite 
i ld not have sold her for it 
ay twas he that told me first:
an honest man he is and hates the slime
that sticks on filthy deeds 
what needs this iteration woman i say thy husband 
he woman 
i say thy husband: dost understand the word 
my friend thy husband honest honest iago 
ha 
peace you were best 
what is the matter how now general 
what is the matter 
i told him what i thought and told no more
than what he found himself was apt and true 
i did 
with cassio mistress go to charm your tongue 
nay stare not masters: it is true indeed 
tis a strange truth 
o monstrous act 
what are you mad i charge you get you home 
o o o 
[rising] o she was foul 
i scarce did know you uncle: there lies your niece 
whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp d:
i know this act shows horrible and grim 
poor desdemona i am glad thy father s dead:
thy match was mortal to him and pure grief
shore his old thread in twain: did he live now 
this sight would make him do a desperate turn 
yea curse his better angel from his side 
and fall to reprobation 
tis pitiful but yet iago knows
that she with cassio hath the act of shame
a thousand times committed cassio confess d it:
and she did gratify his amorous works
with that recognizance and pledge of love
which i first gave her i saw it in his hand:
it was a handkerchief an antique token
my father gave my mother 
come hold your peace 
be wise and get you home 
fie 
your sword upon a woman 
villanous whore 
filth thou liest 
are there no stones in heaven
but what serve for the thunder precious villain 
the woman falls sure he hath kill d his wife 
he s gone but his wife s kill d 
tis a notorious villain take you this weapon 
which i have here recover d from the moor:
come guard the door without let him not pass 
but kill him rather i ll after that same villain 
for tis a damned slave 
i am not valiant neither 
but ever puny whipster gets my sword:
but why should honour outlive honesty 
let it go all 
i have another weapon in this chamber 
it is a sword of spain the ice-brook s temper: 
o here it is uncle i must come forth 
[within] if thou attempt it it will cost thee dear:
thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer 
look in upon me then and speak with me 
or naked as i am i will assault thee 
what is the matter 
behold i have a weapon 
a better never did itself sustain
upon a soldier s thigh: i have seen the day 
that with this little arm and this good sword 
i have made my way through more impediments
than twenty times your stop: but o vain boast 
who can control his fate tis not so now 
be not afraid though you do see me weapon d 
here is my journey s end here is my butt 
and very sea-mark of my utmost sail 
do you go back dismay d tis a lost fear 
man but a rush against othello s breast 
and he retires where should othello go 
now how dost thou look now o ill-starr d wench 
pale as thy smock when we shall meet at compt 
this look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven 
and fiends will snatch at it cold cold my girl 
even like thy chastity o cursed slave 
whip me ye devils 
from the possession of this heavenly sight 
blow me about in winds roast me in sulphur 
wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire 
o desdemona desdemona dead 
oh oh oh 
where is this rash and most unfortunate man 
that s he that was othello: here i am 
where is that viper bring the villain forth 
i look down towards his feet but that s a fable 
if that thou best a devil i cannot kill thee 
wrench his sword from him 
i bleed sir but not kill d 
i am not sorry neither: i ld have thee live 
for in my sense tis happiness to die 
o thou othello thou wert once so good 
fall n in the practise of a damned slave 
what shall be said to thee 
why any thing:
an honourable murderer if you will 
for nought i did in hate but all in honour 
this wretch hath part confess d his villany:
did you and he consent in cassio s death 
ay 
dear general i never gave you cause 
i do believe it and i ask your pardon 
will you i pray demand that demi-devil
why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body 
demand me nothing: what you know you know:
from this time forth i never will speak word 
what not to pray 
torments will ope your lips 
well thou dost best 
sir you shall understand what hath befall n 
which as i think you know not here is a letter
found in the pocket of the slain roderigo 
and here another: the one of them imports
the death of cassio to be undertook
by roderigo 
o villain 
most heathenish and most gross 
now here s another discontented paper 
found in his pocket too and this it seems 
roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain 
but that belike iago in the interim
came in and satisfied him 
o the pernicious caitiff 
how came you cassio by that handkerchief
that was my wife s 
i found it in my chamber:
and he himself confess d but even now
that there he dropp d it for a special purpose
which wrought to his desire 
o fool fool fool 
there is besides in roderigo s letter 
how he upbraids iago that he made him
brave me upon the watch whereon it came
that i was cast: and even but now he spake 
after long seeming dead iago hurt him 
iago set him on 
you must forsake this room and go with us:
your power and your command is taken off 
and cassio rules in cyprus for this slave 
if there be any cunning cruelty
that can torment him much and hold him long 
it shall be his you shall close prisoner rest 
till that the nature of your fault be known
to the venetian state come bring him away 
soft you a word or two before you go 
i have done the state some service and they know t 
no more of that i pray you in your letters 
when you shall these unlucky deeds relate 
speak of me as i am nothing extenuate 
nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak
of one that loved not wisely but too well 
of one not easily jealous but being wrought
perplex d in the extreme of one whose hand 
like the base indian threw a pearl away
richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes 
albeit unused to the melting mood 
drop tears as fast as the arabian trees
their medicinal gum set you down this 
and say besides that in aleppo once 
where a malignant and a turban d turk
beat a venetian and traduced the state 
i took by the throat the circumcised dog 
and smote him thus 
o bloody period 
all that s spoke is marr d 
i kiss d thee ere i kill d thee: no way but this 
killing myself to die upon a kiss 
this did i fear but thought he had no weapon 
for he was great of heart 
more fell than anguish hunger or the sea 
look on the tragic loading of this bed 
this is thy work: the object poisons sight 
let it be hid gratiano keep the house 
and seize upon the fortunes of the moor 
for they succeed on you to you lord governor 
remains the censure of this hellish villain 
the time the place the torture: o enforce it 
myself will straight aboard: and to the state
this heavy act with heavy heart relate 
now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this sun of york 
and all the clouds that lour d upon our house
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried 
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths 
our bruised arms hung up for monuments 
our stern alarums changed to merry meetings 
our dreadful marches to delightful measures 
grim-visaged war hath smooth d his wrinkled front 
and now instead of mounting barded steeds
to fright the souls of fearful adversaries 
he capers nimbly in a lady s chamber
to the lascivious pleasing of a lute 
but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks 
nor made to court an amorous looking-glass 
i that am rudely stamp d and want love s majesty
to strut before a wanton ambling nymph 
i that am curtail d of this fair proportion 
cheated of feature by dissembling nature 
deformed unfinish d sent before my time
into this breathing world scarce half made up 
and that so lamely and unfashionable
that dogs bark at me as i halt by them 
why i in this weak piping time of peace 
have no delight to pass away the time 
unless to spy my shadow in the sun
and descant on mine own deformity:
and therefore since i cannot prove a lover 
to entertain these fair well-spoken days 
i am determined to prove a villain
and hate the idle pleasures of these days 
plots have i laid inductions dangerous 
by drunken prophecies libels and dreams 
to set my brother clarence and the king
in deadly hate the one against the other:
and if king edward be as true and just
as i am subtle false and treacherous 
this day should clarence closely be mew d up 
about a prophecy which says that g 
of edward s heirs the murderer shall be 
dive thoughts down to my soul: here
clarence comes 
brother good day what means this armed guard
that waits upon your grace 
his majesty
tendering my person s safety hath appointed
this conduct to convey me to the tower 
upon what cause 
because my name is george 
alack my lord that fault is none of yours 
he should for that commit your godfathers:
o belike his majesty hath some intent
that you shall be new-christen d in the tower 
but what s the matter clarence may i know 
yea richard when i know for i protest
as yet i do not: but as i can learn 
he hearkens after prophecies and dreams 
and from the cross-row plucks the letter g 
and says a wizard told him that by g
his issue disinherited should be 
and for my name of george begins with g 
it follows in his thought that i am he 
these as i learn and such like toys as these
have moved his highness to commit me now 
why this it is when men are ruled by women:
tis not the king that sends you to the tower:
my lady grey his wife clarence tis she
that tempers him to this extremity 
was it not she and that good man of worship 
anthony woodville her brother there 
that made him send lord hastings to the tower 
from whence this present day he is deliver d 
we are not safe clarence we are not safe 
by heaven i think there s no man is secure
but the queen s kindred and night-walking heralds
that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore 
heard ye not what an humble suppliant
lord hastings was to her for his delivery 
humbly complaining to her deity
got my lord chamberlain his liberty 
i ll tell you what i think it is our way 
if we will keep in favour with the king 
to be her men and wear her livery:
the jealous o erworn widow and herself 
since that our brother dubb d them gentlewomen 
are mighty gossips in this monarchy 
brakenbury
i beseech your graces both to pardon me 
his majesty hath straitly given in charge
that no man shall have private conference 
of what degree soever with his brother 
even so an t please your worship brakenbury 
you may partake of any thing we say:
we speak no treason man: we say the king
is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
well struck in years fair and not jealous 
we say that shore s wife hath a pretty foot 
a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue 
and that the queen s kindred are made gentle-folks:
how say you sir can you deny all this 
brakenbury
with this my lord myself have nought to do 
naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow 
he that doth naught with her excepting one 
were best he do it secretly alone 
brakenbury
what one my lord 
her husband knave: wouldst thou betray me 
brakenbury
i beseech your grace to pardon me and withal
forbear your conference with the noble duke 
we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey 
we are the queen s abjects and must obey 
brother farewell: i will unto the king 
and whatsoever you will employ me in 
were it to call king edward s widow sister 
i will perform it to enfranchise you 
meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
touches me deeper than you can imagine 
i know it pleaseth neither of us well 
well your imprisonment shall not be long 
meantime have patience 
i must perforce farewell 
go tread the path that thou shalt ne er return 
simple plain clarence i do love thee so 
that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven 
if heaven will take the present at our hands 
but who comes here the new-deliver d hastings 
good time of day unto my gracious lord 
as much unto my good lord chamberlain 
well are you welcome to the open air 
how hath your lordship brook d imprisonment 
with patience noble lord as prisoners must:
but i shall live my lord to give them thanks
that were the cause of my imprisonment 
no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too 
for they that were your enemies are his 
and have prevail d as much on him as you 
more pity that the eagle should be mew d 
while kites and buzzards prey at liberty 
what news abroad 
no news so bad abroad as this at home 
the king is sickly weak and melancholy 
and his physicians fear him mightily 
now by saint paul this news is bad indeed 
o he hath kept an evil diet long 
and overmuch consumed his royal person:
tis very grievous to be thought upon 
what is he in his bed 
he is 
go you before and i will follow you 
he cannot live i hope and must not die
till george be pack d with post-horse up to heaven 
i ll in to urge his hatred more to clarence 
with lies well steel d with weighty arguments 
and if i fall not in my deep intent 
clarence hath not another day to live:
which done god take king edward to his mercy 
and leave the world for me to bustle in 
for then i ll marry warwick s youngest daughter 
what though i kill d her husband and her father 
the readiest way to make the wench amends
is to become her husband and her father:
the which will i not all so much for love
as for another secret close intent 
by marrying her which i must reach unto 
but yet i run before my horse to market:
clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns:
when they are gone then must i count my gains 
stay you that bear the corse and set it down 
villains set down the corse or by saint paul 
i ll make a corse of him that disobeys 
gentleman
my lord stand back and let the coffin pass 
unmanner d dog stand thou when i command:
advance thy halbert higher than my breast 
or by saint paul i ll strike thee to my foot 
and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness 
sweet saint for charity be not so curst 
lady you know no rules of charity 
which renders good for bad blessings for curses 
but i know none and therefore am no beast 
more wonderful when angels are so angry 
vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman 
of these supposed-evils to give me leave 
by circumstance but to acquit myself 
fairer than tongue can name thee let me have
some patient leisure to excuse myself 
by such despair i should accuse myself 
say that i slew them not 
i did not kill your husband 
nay he is dead and slain by edward s hand 
i was provoked by her slanderous tongue 
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders 
i grant ye 
the fitter for the king of heaven that hath him 
let him thank me that holp to send him thither 
for he was fitter for that place than earth 
yes one place else if you will hear me name it 
your bed-chamber 
so will it madam till i lie with you 
i know so but gentle lady anne 
to leave this keen encounter of our wits 
and fall somewhat into a slower method 
is not the causer of the timeless deaths
of these plantagenets henry and edward 
as blameful as the executioner 
your beauty was the cause of that effect 
your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
to undertake the death of all the world 
so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom 
these eyes could never endure sweet beauty s wreck 
you should not blemish it if i stood by:
as all the world is cheered by the sun 
so i by that it is my day my life 
curse not thyself fair creature thou art both 
it is a quarrel most unnatural 
to be revenged on him that loveth you 
he that bereft thee lady of thy husband 
did it to help thee to a better husband 
he lives that loves thee better than he could 
plantagenet 
the selfsame name but one of better nature 
here 
why dost thou spit at me 
never came poison from so sweet a place 
thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine 
i would they were that i might die at once 
for now they kill me with a living death 
those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears 
shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
these eyes that never shed remorseful tear 
no when my father york and edward wept 
to hear the piteous moan that rutland made
when black-faced clifford shook his sword at him 
nor when thy warlike father like a child 
told the sad story of my father s death 
and twenty times made pause to sob and weep 
that all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
like trees bedash d with rain: in that sad time
my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear 
and what these sorrows could not thence exhale 
thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping 
i never sued to friend nor enemy 
my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word 
but now thy beauty is proposed my fee 
my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak 
teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made
for kissing lady not for such contempt 
if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive 
lo here i lend thee this sharp-pointed sword 
which if thou please to hide in this true bosom 
and let the soul forth that adoreth thee 
i lay it naked to the deadly stroke 
and humbly beg the death upon my knee 
nay do not pause for i did kill king henry 
but twas thy beauty that provoked me 
nay now dispatch twas i that stabb d young edward 
but twas thy heavenly face that set me on 
take up the sword again or take up me 
then bid me kill myself and i will do it 
tush that was in thy rage:
speak it again and even with the word 
that hand which for thy love did kill thy love 
shall for thy love kill a far truer love 
to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary 
tis figured in my tongue 
then never man was true 
say then my peace is made 
but shall i live in hope 
vouchsafe to wear this ring 
look how this ring encompasseth finger 
even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart 
wear both of them for both of them are thine 
and if thy poor devoted suppliant may
but beg one favour at thy gracious hand 
thou dost confirm his happiness for ever 
that it would please thee leave these sad designs
to him that hath more cause to be a mourner 
and presently repair to crosby place 
where after i have solemnly interr d
at chertsey monastery this noble king 
and wet his grave with my repentant tears 
i will with all expedient duty see you:
for divers unknown reasons i beseech you 
grant me this boon 
bid me farewell 
sirs take up the corse 
gentlemen
towards chertsey noble lord 
no to white-friars there attend my coining 
was ever woman in this humour woo d 
was ever woman in this humour won 
i ll have her but i will not keep her long 
what i that kill d her husband and his father 
to take her in her heart s extremest hate 
with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes 
the bleeding witness of her hatred by 
having god her conscience and these bars
against me 
and i nothing to back my suit at all 
but the plain devil and dissembling looks 
and yet to win her all the world to nothing 
ha 
hath she forgot already that brave prince 
edward her lord whom i some three months since 
stabb d in my angry mood at tewksbury 
a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman 
framed in the prodigality of nature 
young valiant wise and no doubt right royal 
the spacious world cannot again afford
and will she yet debase her eyes on me 
that cropp d the golden prime of this sweet prince 
and made her widow to a woful bed 
on me whose all not equals edward s moiety 
on me that halt and am unshapen thus 
my dukedom to a beggarly denier 
i do mistake my person all this while:
upon my life she finds although i cannot 
myself to be a marvellous proper man 
i ll be at charges for a looking-glass 
and entertain some score or two of tailors 
to study fashions to adorn my body:
since i am crept in favour with myself 
will maintain it with some little cost 
but first i ll turn yon fellow in his grave 
and then return lamenting to my love 
shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass 
that i may see my shadow as i pass 
have patience madam: there s no doubt his majesty
will soon recover his accustom d health 
in that you brook it in it makes him worse:
therefore for god s sake entertain good comfort 
and cheer his grace with quick and merry words 
no other harm but loss of such a lord 
the heavens have bless d you with a goodly son 
to be your comforter when he is gone 
is it concluded that he shall be protector 
here come the lords of buckingham and derby 
good time of day unto your royal grace 
derby
god make your majesty joyful as you have been 
saw you the king to-day my lord of derby 
derby
but now the duke of buckingham and i
are come from visiting his majesty 
madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully 
madam we did: he desires to make atonement
betwixt the duke of gloucester and your brothers 
and betwixt them and my lord chamberlain 
and sent to warn them to his royal presence 
they do me wrong and i will not endure it:
who are they that complain unto the king 
that i forsooth am stern and love them not 
by holy paul they love his grace but lightly
that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours 
because i cannot flatter and speak fair 
smile in men s faces smooth deceive and cog 
duck with french nods and apish courtesy 
i must be held a rancorous enemy 
cannot a plain man live and think no harm 
but thus his simple truth must be abused
by silken sly insinuating jacks 
to whom in all this presence speaks your grace 
to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace 
when have i injured thee when done thee wrong 
or thee or thee or any of your faction 
a plague upon you all his royal person 
whom god preserve better than you would wish 
cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while 
but you must trouble him with lewd complaints 
i cannot tell: the world is grown so bad 
that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
since every jack became a gentleman
there s many a gentle person made a jack 
meantime god grants that we have need of you:
your brother is imprison d by your means 
myself disgraced and the nobility
held in contempt whilst many fair promotions
are daily given to ennoble those
that scarce some two days since were worth a noble 
you may deny that you were not the cause
of my lord hastings late imprisonment 
she may my lord for 
she may lord rivers why who knows not so 
she may do more sir than denying that:
she may help you to many fair preferments 
and then deny her aiding hand therein 
and lay those honours on your high deserts 
what may she not she may yea marry may she 
what marry may she 
what marry may she marry with a king 
a bachelor a handsome stripling too:
i wis your grandam had a worser match 
what threat you me with telling of the king 
tell him and spare not: look what i have said
i will avouch in presence of the king:
i dare adventure to be sent to the tower 
tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot 
ere you were queen yea or your husband king 
i was a pack-horse in his great affairs 
a weeder-out of his proud adversaries 
a liberal rewarder of his friends:
to royalize his blood i spilt mine own 
in all which time you and your husband grey
were factious for the house of lancaster 
and rivers so were you was not your husband
in margaret s battle at saint alban s slain 
let me put in your minds if you forget 
what you have been ere now and what you are 
withal what i have been and what i am 
poor clarence did forsake his father warwick 
yea and forswore himself which jesu pardon 
to fight on edward s party for the crown 
and for his meed poor lord he is mew d up 
i would to god my heart were flint like edward s 
or edward s soft and pitiful like mine
i am too childish-foolish for this world 
my lord of gloucester in those busy days
which here you urge to prove us enemies 
we follow d then our lord our lawful king:
so should we you if you should be our king 
if i should be i had rather be a pedlar:
far be it from my heart the thought of it 
foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight 
wert thou not banished on pain of death 
the curse my noble father laid on thee 
when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
and with thy scorns drew st rivers from his eyes 
and then to dry them gavest the duke a clout
steep d in the faultless blood of pretty rutland 
his curses then from bitterness of soul
denounced against thee are all fall n upon thee 
and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed 
o twas the foulest deed to slay that babe 
and the most merciless that e er was heard of 
tyrants themselves wept when it was reported 
no man but prophesied revenge for it 
northumberland then present wept to see it 
have done thy charm thou hateful wither d hag 
margaret 
ha 
i cry thee mercy then for i had thought
that thou hadst call d me all these bitter names 
tis done by me and ends in margaret 
false-boding woman end thy frantic curse 
lest to thy harm thou move our patience 
were you well served you would be taught your duty 
dispute not with her she is lunatic 
good counsel marry: learn it learn it marquess 
it toucheth you my lord as much as me 
yea and much more: but i was born so high 
our aery buildeth in the cedar s top 
and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun 
have done for shame if not for charity 
have done have done 
nor no one here for curses never pass
the lips of those that breathe them in the air 
what doth she say my lord of buckingham 
nothing that i respect my gracious lord 
my hair doth stand on end to hear her curses 
and so doth mine: i muse why she s at liberty 
i cannot blame her: by god s holy mother 
she hath had too much wrong and i repent
my part thereof that i have done to her 
but you have all the vantage of her wrong 
i was too hot to do somebody good 
that is too cold in thinking of it now 
marry as for clarence he is well repaid 
he is frank d up to fatting for his pains
god pardon them that are the cause of it 
a virtuous and a christian-like conclusion 
to pray for them that have done scathe to us 
so do i ever:
being well-advised 
for had i cursed now i had cursed myself 
madam his majesty doth call for you 
and for your grace and you my noble lords 
madam we will attend your grace 
i do the wrong and first begin to brawl 
the secret mischiefs that i set abroach
i lay unto the grievous charge of others 
clarence whom i indeed have laid in darkness 
i do beweep to many simple gulls
namely to hastings derby buckingham 
and say it is the queen and her allies
that stir the king against the duke my brother 
now they believe it and withal whet me
to be revenged on rivers vaughan grey:
but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture 
tell them that god bids us do good for evil:
and thus i clothe my naked villany
with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ 
and seem a saint when most i play the devil 
but soft here come my executioners 
how now my hardy stout resolved mates 
are you now going to dispatch this deed 
we are my lord and come to have the warrant
that we may be admitted where he is 
well thought upon i have it here about me 
when you have done repair to crosby place 
but sirs be sudden in the execution 
withal obdurate do not hear him plead 
for clarence is well-spoken and perhaps
may move your hearts to pity if you mark him 
tush 
fear not my lord we will not stand to prate 
talkers are no good doers: be assured
we come to use our hands and not our tongues 
your eyes drop millstones when fools eyes drop tears:
i like you lads about your business straight 
go go dispatch 
we will my noble lord 
brakenbury
why looks your grace so heavily today 
o i have pass d a miserable night 
so full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams 
that as i am a christian faithful man 
i would not spend another such a night 
though twere to buy a world of happy days 
so full of dismal terror was the time 
brakenbury
what was your dream i long to hear you tell it 
methoughts that i had broken from the tower 
and was embark d to cross to burgundy 
and in my company my brother gloucester 
who from my cabin tempted me to walk
upon the hatches: thence we looked toward england 
and cited up a thousand fearful times 
during the wars of york and lancaster
that had befall n us as we paced along
upon the giddy footing of the hatches 
methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling 
struck me that thought to stay him overboard 
into the tumbling billows of the main 
lord lord methought what pain it was to drown 
what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears 
what ugly sights of death within mine eyes 
methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks 
ten thousand men that fishes gnaw d upon 
wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl 
inestimable stones unvalued jewels 
all scatter d in the bottom of the sea:
some lay in dead men s skulls and in those holes
where eyes did once inhabit there were crept 
as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems 
which woo d the slimy bottom of the deep 
and mock d the dead bones that lay scatter d by 
brakenbury
had you such leisure in the time of death
to gaze upon the secrets of the deep 
methought i had and often did i strive
to yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
kept in my soul and would not let it forth
to seek the empty vast and wandering air 
but smother d it within my panting bulk 
which almost burst to belch it in the sea 
brakenbury
awaked you not with this sore agony 
o no my dream was lengthen d after life 
o then began the tempest to my soul 
who pass d methought the melancholy flood 
with that grim ferryman which poets write of 
unto the kingdom of perpetual night 
the first that there did greet my stranger soul 
was my great father-in-law renowned warwick 
who cried aloud what scourge for perjury
can this dark monarchy afford false clarence 
and so he vanish d: then came wandering by
a shadow like an angel with bright hair
dabbled in blood and he squeak d out aloud 
clarence is come false fleeting perjured clarence 
that stabb d me in the field by tewksbury 
seize on him furies take him to your torments 
with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends
environ d me about and howled in mine ears
such hideous cries that with the very noise
i trembling waked and for a season after
could not believe but that i was in hell 
such terrible impression made the dream 
brakenbury
no marvel my lord though it affrighted you 
i promise i am afraid to hear you tell it 
o brakenbury i have done those things 
which now bear evidence against my soul 
for edward s sake and see how he requites me 
o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee 
but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds 
yet execute thy wrath in me alone 
o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children 
i pray thee gentle keeper stay by me 
my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep 
brakenbury
i will my lord: god give your grace good rest 
sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours 
makes the night morning and the noon-tide night 
princes have but their tides for their glories 
an outward honour for an inward toil 
and for unfelt imagination 
they often feel a world of restless cares:
so that betwixt their tides and low names 
there s nothing differs but the outward fame 
ho who s here 
brakenbury
in god s name what are you and how came you hither 
i would speak with clarence and i came hither on my legs 
brakenbury
yea are you so brief 
o sir it is better to be brief than tedious show
him our commission talk no more 
brakenbury
i am in this commanded to deliver
the noble duke of clarence to your hands:
i will not reason what is meant hereby 
because i will be guiltless of the meaning 
here are the keys there sits the duke asleep:
i ll to the king and signify to him
that thus i have resign d my charge to you 
do so it is a point of wisdom: fare you well 
exit brakenbury
what shall we stab him as he sleeps 
no then he will say twas done cowardly when he wakes 
when he wakes why fool he shall never wake till
the judgment-day 
why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping 
the urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind
of remorse in me 
what art thou afraid 
not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be
damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us 
i thought thou hadst been resolute 
so i am to let him live 
back to the duke of gloucester tell him so 
i pray thee stay a while: i hope my holy humour
will change twas wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty 
how dost thou feel thyself now 
faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet
within me 
remember our reward when the deed is done 
zounds he dies: i had forgot the reward 
where is thy conscience now 
in the duke of gloucester s purse 
so when he opens his purse to give us our reward 
thy conscience flies out 
let it go there s few or none will entertain it 
how if it come to thee again 
i ll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal but it
accuseth him he cannot swear but it cheques him 
he cannot lie with his neighbour s wife but it
detects him: tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man s bosom it fills one full of
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
that i found it beggars any man that keeps it: it
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
dangerous thing and every man that means to live
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
without it 
zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me
not to kill the duke 
take the devil in thy mind and relieve him not: he
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh 
tut i am strong-framed he cannot prevail with me 
i warrant thee 
spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
reputation come shall we to this gear 
take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
sword and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
in the next room 
o excellent devise make a sop of him 
hark he stirs: shall i strike 
no first let s reason with him 
where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine 
you shall have wine enough my lord anon 
in god s name what art thou 
a man as you are 
but not as i am royal 
nor you as we are loyal 
thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble 
my voice is now the king s my looks mine own 
how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak 
your eyes do menace me: why look you pale 
who sent you hither wherefore do you come 
both
to to to 
to murder me 
both
ay ay 
you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so 
and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it 
wherein my friends have i offended you 
offended us you have not but the king 
i shall be reconciled to him again 
never my lord therefore prepare to die 
are you call d forth from out a world of men
to slay the innocent what is my offence 
where are the evidence that do accuse me 
what lawful quest have given their verdict up
unto the frowning judge or who pronounced
the bitter sentence of poor clarence death 
before i be convict by course of law 
to threaten me with death is most unlawful 
i charge you as you hope to have redemption
by christ s dear blood shed for our grievous sins 
that you depart and lay no hands on me
the deed you undertake is damnable 
what we will do we do upon command 
and he that hath commanded is the king 
erroneous vassal the great king of kings
hath in the tables of his law commanded
that thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou then 
spurn at his edict and fulfil a man s 
take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands 
to hurl upon their heads that break his law 
and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee 
for false forswearing and for murder too:
thou didst receive the holy sacrament 
to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster 
and like a traitor to the name of god 
didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade
unrip dst the bowels of thy sovereign s son 
whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend 
how canst thou urge god s dreadful law to us 
when thou hast broke it in so dear degree 
alas for whose sake did i that ill deed 
for edward for my brother for his sake: why sirs 
he sends ye not to murder me for this
for in this sin he is as deep as i 
if god will be revenged for this deed 
o know you yet he doth it publicly 
take not the quarrel from his powerful arm 
he needs no indirect nor lawless course
to cut off those that have offended him 
who made thee then a bloody minister 
when gallant-springing brave plantagenet 
that princely novice was struck dead by thee 
my brother s love the devil and my rage 
thy brother s love our duty and thy fault 
provoke us hither now to slaughter thee 
oh if you love my brother hate not me 
i am his brother and i love him well 
if you be hired for meed go back again 
and i will send you to my brother gloucester 
who shall reward you better for my life
than edward will for tidings of my death 
you are deceived your brother gloucester hates you 
o no he loves me and he holds me dear:
go you to him from me 
both
ay so we will 
tell him when that our princely father york
bless d his three sons with his victorious arm 
and charged us from his soul to love each other 
he little thought of this divided friendship:
bid gloucester think of this and he will weep 
ay millstones as be lesson d us to weep 
o do not slander him for he is kind 
right 
as snow in harvest thou deceivest thyself:
tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee 
it cannot be for when i parted with him 
he hugg d me in his arms and swore with sobs 
that he would labour my delivery 
why so he doth now he delivers thee
from this world s thraldom to the joys of heaven 
make peace with god for you must die my lord 
hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul 
to counsel me to make my peace with god 
and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind 
that thou wilt war with god by murdering me 
ah sirs consider he that set you on
to do this deed will hate you for the deed 
what shall we do 
relent and save your souls 
relent tis cowardly and womanish 
not to relent is beastly savage devilish 
which of you if you were a prince s son 
being pent from liberty as i am now 
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you 
would not entreat for life 
my friend i spy some pity in thy looks:
o if thine eye be not a flatterer 
come thou on my side and entreat for me 
as you would beg were you in my distress
a begging prince what beggar pities not 
look behind you my lord 
take that and that: if all this will not do 
i ll drown you in the malmsey-butt within 
a bloody deed and desperately dispatch d 
how fain like pilate would i wash my hands
of this most grievous guilty murder done 
how now what mean st thou that thou help st me not 
by heavens the duke shall know how slack thou art 
i would he knew that i had saved his brother 
take thou the fee and tell him what i say 
for i repent me that the duke is slain 
so do not i: go coward as thou art 
now must i hide his body in some hole 
until the duke take order for his burial:
and when i have my meed i must away 
for this will out and here i must not stay 
why so: now have i done a good day s work:
you peers continue this united league:
i every day expect an embassage
from my redeemer to redeem me hence 
and now in peace my soul shall part to heaven 
since i have set my friends at peace on earth 
rivers and hastings take each other s hand 
dissemble not your hatred swear your love 
by heaven my heart is purged from grudging hate:
and with my hand i seal my true heart s love 
so thrive i as i truly swear the like 
take heed you dally not before your king 
lest he that is the supreme king of kings
confound your hidden falsehood and award
either of you to be the other s end 
so prosper i as i swear perfect love 
and i as i love hastings with my heart 
madam yourself are not exempt in this 
nor your son dorset buckingham nor you 
you have been factious one against the other 
wife love lord hastings let him kiss your hand 
and what you do do it unfeignedly 
dorset embrace him hastings love lord marquess 
this interchange of love i here protest 
upon my part shall be unviolable 
and so swear i my lord
now princely buckingham seal thou this league
with thy embracements to my wife s allies 
and make me happy in your unity 
whenever buckingham doth turn his hate
on you or yours 
but with all duteous love
doth cherish you and yours god punish me
with hate in those where i expect most love 
when i have most need to employ a friend 
and most assured that he is a friend
deep hollow treacherous and full of guile 
be he unto me this do i beg of god 
when i am cold in zeal to yours 
a pleasing cordial princely buckingham 
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart 
there wanteth now our brother gloucester here 
to make the perfect period of this peace 
and in good time here comes the noble duke 
good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
and princely peers a happy time of day 
happy indeed as we have spent the day 
brother we done deeds of charity 
made peace enmity fair love of hate 
between these swelling wrong-incensed peers 
a blessed labour my most sovereign liege:
amongst this princely heap if any here 
by false intelligence or wrong surmise 
hold me a foe 
if i unwittingly or in my rage 
have aught committed that is hardly borne
by any in this presence i desire
to reconcile me to his friendly peace:
tis death to me to be at enmity 
i hate it and desire all good men s love 
first madam i entreat true peace of you 
which i will purchase with my duteous service 
of you my noble cousin buckingham 
if ever any grudge were lodged between us 
of you lord rivers and lord grey of you 
that without desert have frown d on me 
dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all 
i do not know that englishman alive
with whom my soul is any jot at odds
more than the infant that is born to-night
i thank my god for my humility 
why madam have i offer d love for this
to be so bouted in this royal presence 
who knows not that the noble duke is dead 
you do him injury to scorn his corse 
who knows not he is dead who knows he is 
look i so pale lord dorset as the rest 
ay my good lord and no one in this presence
but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks 
is clarence dead the order was reversed 
but he poor soul by your first order died 
and that a winged mercury did bear:
some tardy cripple bore the countermand 
that came too lag to see him buried 
god grant that some less noble and less loyal 
nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood 
deserve not worse than wretched clarence did 
and yet go current from suspicion 
derby
a boon my sovereign for my service done 
i pray thee peace: my soul is full of sorrow 
derby
i will not rise unless your highness grant 
then speak at once what is it thou demand st 
derby
the forfeit sovereign of my servant s life 
who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
lately attendant on the duke of norfolk 
have a tongue to doom my brother s death 
and shall the same give pardon to a slave 
my brother slew no man his fault was thought 
and yet his punishment was cruel death 
who sued to me for him who in my rage 
kneel d at my feet and bade me be advised
who spake of brotherhood who spake of love 
who told me how the poor soul did forsake
the mighty warwick and did fight for me 
who told me in the field by tewksbury
when oxford had me down he rescued me 
and said dear brother live and be a king 
who told me when we both lay in the field
frozen almost to death how he did lap me
even in his own garments and gave himself 
all thin and naked to the numb cold night 
all this from my remembrance brutish wrath
sinfully pluck d and not a man of you
had so much grace to put it in my mind 
but when your carters or your waiting-vassals
have done a drunken slaughter and defaced
the precious image of our dear redeemer 
you straight are on your knees for pardon pardon 
and i unjustly too must grant it you
but for my brother not a man would speak 
nor i ungracious speak unto myself
for him poor soul the proudest of you all
have been beholding to him in his life 
yet none of you would once plead for his life 
o god i fear thy justice will take hold
on me and you and mine and yours for this 
come hastings help me to my closet 
oh poor clarence 
this is the fruit of rashness mark d you not
how that the guilty kindred of the queen
look d pale when they did hear of clarence death 
o they did urge it still unto the king 
god will revenge it but come let us in 
to comfort edward with our company 
we wait upon your grace 
boy
tell me good grandam is our father dead 
comfort dear mother: god is much displeased
that you take with unthankfulness his doing:
in common worldly things tis call d ungrateful 
with dull unwilligness to repay a debt
which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent 
much more to be thus opposite with heaven 
for it requires the royal debt it lent you 
madam bethink you like a careful mother 
of the young prince your son: send straight for him
let him be crown d in him your comfort lives:
drown desperate sorrow in dead edward s grave 
and plant your joys in living edward s throne 
madam have comfort: all of us have cause
to wail the dimming of our shining star 
but none can cure their harms by wailing them 
madam my mother i do cry you mercy 
i did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
i crave your blessing 
[aside] amen and make me die a good old man 
that is the butt-end of a mother s blessing:
i marvel why her grace did leave it out 
you cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers 
that bear this mutual heavy load of moan 
now cheer each other in each other s love
though we have spent our harvest of this king 
we are to reap the harvest of his son 
the broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts 
but lately splinter d knit and join d together 
must gently be preserved cherish d and kept:
me seemeth good that with some little train 
forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetch d
hither to london to be crown d our king 
why with some little train my lord of buckingham 
marry my lord lest by a multitude 
the new-heal d wound of malice should break out 
which would be so much the more dangerous
by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern d:
where every horse bears his commanding rein 
and may direct his course as please himself 
as well the fear of harm as harm apparent 
in my opinion ought to be prevented 
i hope the king made peace with all of us
and the compact is firm and true in me 
and so in me and so i think in all:
yet since it is but green it should be put
to no apparent likelihood of breach 
which haply by much company might be urged:
therefore i say with noble buckingham 
that it is meet so few should fetch the prince 
and so say i 
then be it so and go we to determine
who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow 
madam and you my mother will you go
to give your censures in this weighty business 
my lord whoever journeys to the prince 
for god s sake let not us two be behind 
for by the way i ll sort occasion 
as index to the story we late talk d of 
to part the queen s proud kindred from the king 
my other self my counsel s consistory 
my oracle my prophet my dear cousin 
i like a child will go by thy direction 
towards ludlow then for we ll not stay behind 
neighbour well met: whither away so fast 
i promise you i scarcely know myself:
hear you the news abroad 
ay that the king is dead 
bad news by r lady seldom comes the better:
i fear i fear twill prove a troublous world 
neighbours god speed 
give you good morrow sir 
doth this news hold of good king edward s death 
ay sir it is too true god help the while 
then masters look to see a troublous world 
no no by god s good grace his son shall reign 
woe to the land that s govern d by a child 
in him there is a hope of government 
that in his nonage council under him 
and in his full and ripen d years himself 
no doubt shall then and till then govern well 
so stood the state when henry the sixth
was crown d in paris but at nine months old 
stood the state so no no good friends god wot 
for then this land was famously enrich d
with politic grave counsel then the king
had virtuous uncles to protect his grace 
why so hath this both by the father and mother 
better it were they all came by the father 
or by the father there were none at all 
for emulation now who shall be nearest 
will touch us all too near if god prevent not 
o full of danger is the duke of gloucester 
and the queen s sons and brothers haught and proud:
and were they to be ruled and not to rule 
this sickly land might solace as before 
come come we fear the worst all shall be well 
when clouds appear wise men put on their cloaks 
when great leaves fall the winter is at hand 
when the sun sets who doth not look for night 
untimely storms make men expect a dearth 
all may be well but if god sort it so 
tis more than we deserve or i expect 
truly the souls of men are full of dread:
ye cannot reason almost with a man
that looks not heavily and full of fear 
before the times of change still is it so:
by a divine instinct men s minds mistrust
ensuing dangers as by proof we see
the waters swell before a boisterous storm 
but leave it all to god whither away 
marry we were sent for to the justices 
and so was i: i ll bear you company 
archbishop of york
last night i hear they lay at northampton 
at stony-stratford will they be to-night:
to-morrow or next day they will be here 
such news my lord as grieves me to unfold 
well madam and in health 
lord rivers and lord grey are sent to pomfret 
with them sir thomas vaughan prisoners 
the mighty dukes
gloucester and buckingham 
the sum of all i can i have disclosed 
why or for what these nobles were committed
is all unknown to me my gracious lady 
welcome sweet prince to london to your chamber 
welcome dear cousin my thoughts sovereign
the weary way hath made you melancholy 
no uncle but our crosses on the way
have made it tedious wearisome and heavy
i want more uncles here to welcome me 
sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years
hath not yet dived into the world s deceit
nor more can you distinguish of a man
than of his outward show which god he knows 
seldom or never jumpeth with the heart 
those uncles which you want were dangerous 
your grace attended to their sugar d words 
but look d not on the poison of their hearts :
god keep you from them and from such false friends 
god keep me from false friends but they were none 
my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you 
god bless your grace with health and happy days 
i thank you good my lord and thank you all 
i thought my mother and my brother york 
would long ere this have met us on the way
fie what a slug is hastings that he comes not
to tell us whether they will come or no 
and in good time here comes the sweating lord 
welcome my lord: what will our mother come 
on what occasion god he knows not i 
the queen your mother and your brother york 
have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
would fain have come with me to meet your grace 
but by his mother was perforce withheld 
fie what an indirect and peevish course
is this of hers lord cardinal will your grace
persuade the queen to send the duke of york
unto his princely brother presently 
if she deny lord hastings go with him 
and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce 
cardinal
my lord of buckingham if my weak oratory
can from his mother win the duke of york 
anon expect him here but if she be obdurate
to mild entreaties god in heaven forbid
we should infringe the holy privilege
of blessed sanctuary not for all this land
would i be guilty of so deep a sin 
you are too senseless obstinate my lord 
too ceremonious and traditional
weigh it but with the grossness of this age 
you break not sanctuary in seizing him 
the benefit thereof is always granted
to those whose dealings have deserved the place 
and those who have the wit to claim the place:
this prince hath neither claim d it nor deserved it 
and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it:
then taking him from thence that is not there 
you break no privilege nor charter there 
oft have i heard of sanctuary men 
but sanctuary children ne er till now 
cardinal
my lord you shall o er-rule my mind for once 
come on lord hastings will you go with me 
i go my lord 
good lords make all the speedy haste you may 
say uncle gloucester if our brother come 
where shall we sojourn till our coronation 
where it seems best unto your royal self 
if i may counsel you some day or two
your highness shall repose you at the tower:
then where you please and shall be thought most fit
for your best health and recreation 
i do not like the tower of any place 
did julius caesar build that place my lord 
he did my gracious lord begin that place 
which since succeeding ages have re-edified 
is it upon record or else reported
successively from age to age he built it 
upon record my gracious lord 
but say my lord it were not register d 
methinks the truth should live from age to age 
as twere retail d to all posterity 
even to the general all-ending day 
[aside] so wise so young they say do never
live long 
what say you uncle 
i say without characters fame lives long 
thus like the formal vice iniquity 
i moralize two meanings in one word 
that julius caesar was a famous man 
with what his valour did enrich his wit 
his wit set down to make his valour live
death makes no conquest of this conqueror 
for now he lives in fame though not in life 
i ll tell you what my cousin buckingham 
what my gracious lord 
an if i live until i be a man 
i ll win our ancient right in france again 
or die a soldier as i lived a king 
[aside] short summers lightly have a forward spring 
now in good time here comes the duke of york 
richard of york how fares our loving brother 
york
well my dread lord so must i call you now 
ay brother to our grief as it is yours:
too late he died that might have kept that title 
which by his death hath lost much majesty 
how fares our cousin noble lord of york 
york
i thank you gentle uncle o my lord 
you said that idle weeds are fast in growth
the prince my brother hath outgrown me far 
he hath my lord 
york
and therefore is he idle 
o my fair cousin i must not say so 
york
then is he more beholding to you than i 
he may command me as my sovereign 
but you have power in me as in a kinsman 
york
i pray you uncle give me this dagger 
my dagger little cousin with all my heart 
a beggar brother 
york
of my kind uncle that i know will give 
and being but a toy which is no grief to give 
a greater gift than that i ll give my cousin 
york
a greater gift o that s the sword to it 
a gentle cousin were it light enough 
york
o then i see you will part but with light gifts 
in weightier things you ll say a beggar nay 
it is too heavy for your grace to wear 
york
i weigh it lightly were it heavier 
what would you have my weapon little lord 
york
i would that i might thank you as you call me 
how 
york
little 
my lord of york will still be cross in talk:
uncle your grace knows how to bear with him 
york
you mean to bear me not to bear with me:
uncle my brother mocks both you and me 
because that i am little like an ape 
he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders 
with what a sharp-provided wit he reasons 
to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle 
he prettily and aptly taunts himself:
so cunning and so young is wonderful 
my lord will t please you pass along 
myself and my good cousin buckingham
will to your mother to entreat of her
to meet you at the tower and welcome you 
york
what will you go unto the tower my lord 
my lord protector needs will have it so 
york
i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower 
why what should you fear 
york
marry my uncle clarence angry ghost:
my grandam told me he was murdered there 
i fear no uncles dead 
nor none that live i hope 
an if they live i hope i need not fear 
but come my lord and with a heavy heart 
thinking on them go i unto the tower 
think you my lord this little prating york
was not incensed by his subtle mother
to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously 
no doubt no doubt o tis a parlous boy 
bold quick ingenious forward capable
he is all the mother s from the top to toe 
well let them rest come hither catesby 
thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
as closely to conceal what we impart:
thou know st our reasons urged upon the way 
what think st thou is it not an easy matter
to make william lord hastings of our mind 
for the instalment of this noble duke
in the seat royal of this famous isle 
he for his father s sake so loves the prince 
that he will not be won to aught against him 
what think st thou then of stanley what will he 
he will do all in all as hastings doth 
well then no more but this: go gentle catesby 
and as it were far off sound thou lord hastings 
how doth he stand affected to our purpose 
and summon him to-morrow to the tower 
to sit about the coronation 
if thou dost find him tractable to us 
encourage him and show him all our reasons:
if he be leaden icy-cold unwilling 
be thou so too and so break off your talk 
and give us notice of his inclination:
for we to-morrow hold divided councils 
wherein thyself shalt highly be employ d 
commend me to lord william: tell him catesby 
his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
to-morrow are let blood at pomfret-castle 
and bid my friend for joy of this good news 
give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more 
good catesby go effect this business soundly 
my good lords both with all the heed i may 
shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep 
you shall my lord 
at crosby place there shall you find us both 
now my lord what shall we do if we perceive
lord hastings will not yield to our complots 
chop off his head man somewhat we will do:
and look when i am king claim thou of me
the earldom of hereford and the moveables
whereof the king my brother stood possess d 
i ll claim that promise at your grace s hands 
and look to have it yielded with all willingness 
come let us sup betimes that afterwards
we may digest our complots in some form 
what ho my lord 
who knocks at the door 
a messenger from the lord stanley 
what is t o clock 
upon the stroke of four 
cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights 
so it should seem by that i have to say 
first he commends him to your noble lordship 
and then 
and then he sends you word
he dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
besides he says there are two councils held 
and that may be determined at the one
which may make you and him to rue at the other 
therefore he sends to know your lordship s pleasure 
if presently you will take horse with him 
and with all speed post with him toward the north 
to shun the danger that his soul divines 
go fellow go return unto thy lord 
bid him not fear the separated councils
his honour and myself are at the one 
and at the other is my servant catesby
where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
whereof i shall not have intelligence 
tell him his fears are shallow wanting instance:
and for his dreams i wonder he is so fond
to trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
to fly the boar before the boar pursues 
were to incense the boar to follow us
and make pursuit where he did mean no chase 
go bid thy master rise and come to me
and we will both together to the tower 
where he shall see the boar will use us kindly 
my gracious lord i ll tell him what you say 
many good morrows to my noble lord 
good morrow catesby you are early stirring
what news what news in this our tottering state 
it is a reeling world indeed my lord 
and i believe twill never stand upright
till richard wear the garland of the realm 
how wear the garland dost thou mean the crown 
ay my good lord 
i ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
ere i will see the crown so foul misplaced 
but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it 
ay on my life and hopes to find forward
upon his party for the gain thereof:
and thereupon he sends you this good news 
that this same very day your enemies 
the kindred of the queen must die at pomfret 
indeed i am no mourner for that news 
because they have been still mine enemies:
but that i ll give my voice on richard s side 
to bar my master s heirs in true descent 
god knows i will not do it to the death 
god keep your lordship in that gracious mind 
but i shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence 
that they who brought me in my master s hate
i live to look upon their tragedy 
i tell thee catesby 
what my lord 
ere a fortnight make me elder 
i ll send some packing that yet think not on it 
tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord 
when men are unprepared and look not for it 
o monstrous monstrous and so falls it out
with rivers vaughan grey: and so twill do
with some men else who think themselves as safe
as thou and i who as thou know st are dear
to princely richard and to buckingham 
the princes both make high account of you 
for they account his head upon the bridge 
i know they do and i have well deserved it 
come on come on where is your boar-spear man 
fear you the boar and go so unprovided 
my lord good morrow good morrow catesby:
you may jest on but by the holy rood 
i do not like these several councils i 
my lord 
i hold my life as dear as you do yours 
and never in my life i do protest 
was it more precious to me than tis now:
think you but that i know our state secure 
i would be so triumphant as i am 
the lords at pomfret when they rode from london 
were jocund and supposed their state was sure 
and they indeed had no cause to mistrust 
but yet you see how soon the day o ercast 
this sudden stag of rancour i misdoubt:
pray god i say i prove a needless coward 
what shall we toward the tower the day is spent 
come come have with you wot you what my lord 
to-day the lords you talk of are beheaded 
they for their truth might better wear their heads
than some that have accused them wear their hats 
but come my lord let us away 
go on before i ll talk with this good fellow 
how now sirrah how goes the world with thee 
pursuivant
the better that your lordship please to ask 
i tell thee man tis better with me now
than when i met thee last where now we meet:
then was i going prisoner to the tower 
by the suggestion of the queen s allies 
but now i tell thee keep it to thyself 
this day those enemies are put to death 
and i in better state than e er i was 
pursuivant
god hold it to your honour s good content 
gramercy fellow: there drink that for me 
pursuivant
god save your lordship 
priest
well met my lord i am glad to see your honour 
i thank thee good sir john with all my heart 
i am in your debt for your last exercise 
come the next sabbath and i will content you 
what talking with a priest lord chamberlain 
your friends at pomfret they do need the priest 
your honour hath no shriving work in hand 
good faith and when i met this holy man 
those men you talk of came into my mind 
what go you toward the tower 
i do my lord but long i shall not stay
i shall return before your lordship thence 
tis like enough for i stay dinner there 
[aside] and supper too although thou know st it not 
come will you go 
i ll wait upon your lordship 
come bring forth the prisoners 
sir richard ratcliff let me tell thee this:
to-day shalt thou behold a subject die
for truth for duty and for loyalty 
god keep the prince from all the pack of you 
a knot you are of damned blood-suckers 
you live that shall cry woe for this after 
dispatch the limit of your lives is out 
o pomfret pomfret o thou bloody prison 
fatal and ominous to noble peers 
within the guilty closure of thy walls
richard the second here was hack d to death 
and for more slander to thy dismal seat 
we give thee up our guiltless blood to drink 
now margaret s curse is fall n upon our heads 
for standing by when richard stabb d her son 
then cursed she hastings then cursed she buckingham 
then cursed she richard o remember god
to hear her prayers for them as now for us
and for my sister and her princely sons 
be satisfied dear god with our true blood 
which as thou know st unjustly must be spilt 
make haste the hour of death is expiate 
come grey come vaughan let us all embrace:
and take our leave until we meet in heaven 
my lords at once: the cause why we are met
is to determine of the coronation 
in god s name speak: when is the royal day 
are all things fitting for that royal time 
derby
it is and wants but nomination 
bishop of ely
to-morrow then i judge a happy day 
who knows the lord protector s mind herein 
who is most inward with the royal duke 
bishop of ely
your grace we think should soonest know his mind 
who i my lord i we know each other s faces 
but for our hearts he knows no more of mine 
than i of yours 
nor i no more of his than you of mine 
lord hastings you and he are near in love 
i thank his grace i know he loves me well 
but for his purpose in the coronation 
i have not sounded him nor he deliver d
his gracious pleasure any way therein:
but you my noble lords may name the time 
and in the duke s behalf i ll give my voice 
which i presume he ll take in gentle part 
bishop of ely
now in good time here comes the duke himself 
my noble lords and cousins all good morrow 
i have been long a sleeper but i hope 
my absence doth neglect no great designs 
which by my presence might have been concluded 
had not you come upon your cue my lord
william lord hastings had pronounced your part 
i mean your voice for crowning of the king 
than my lord hastings no man might be bolder 
his lordship knows me well and loves me well 
i thank your grace 
my lord of ely 
bishop of ely
my lord 
when i was last in holborn 
i saw good strawberries in your garden there
i do beseech you send for some of them 
bishop of ely
marry and will my lord with all my heart 
cousin of buckingham a word with you 
catesby hath sounded hastings in our business 
and finds the testy gentleman so hot 
as he will lose his head ere give consent
his master s son as worshipful as he terms it 
shall lose the royalty of england s throne 
withdraw you hence my lord i ll follow you 
derby
we have not yet set down this day of triumph 
to-morrow in mine opinion is too sudden 
for i myself am not so well provided
as else i would be were the day prolong d 
bishop of ely
where is my lord protector i have sent for these
strawberries 
his grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day 
there s some conceit or other likes him well 
when he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit 
i think there s never a man in christendom
that can less hide his love or hate than he 
for by his face straight shall you know his heart 
derby
what of his heart perceive you in his face
by any likelihood he show d to-day 
marry that with no man here he is offended 
for were he he had shown it in his looks 
derby
i pray god he be not i say 
i pray you all tell me what they deserve
that do conspire my death with devilish plots
of damned witchcraft and that have prevail d
upon my body with their hellish charms 
the tender love i bear your grace my lord 
makes me most forward in this noble presence
to doom the offenders whatsoever they be
i say my lord they have deserved death 
then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
see how i am bewitch d behold mine arm
is like a blasted sapling wither d up:
and this is edward s wife that monstrous witch 
consorted with that harlot strumpet shore 
that by their witchcraft thus have marked me 
if they have done this thing my gracious lord 
if i thou protector of this damned strumpet 
tellest thou me of ifs thou art a traitor:
off with his head now by saint paul i swear 
i will not dine until i see the same 
lovel and ratcliff look that it be done:
the rest that love me rise and follow me 
woe woe for england not a whit for me 
for i too fond might have prevented this 
stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm 
but i disdain d it and did scorn to fly:
three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble 
and startled when he look d upon the tower 
as loath to bear me to the slaughter-house 
o now i want the priest that spake to me:
i now repent i told the pursuivant
as twere triumphing at mine enemies 
how they at pomfret bloodily were butcher d 
and i myself secure in grace and favour 
o margaret margaret now thy heavy curse
is lighted on poor hastings wretched head 
dispatch my lord the duke would be at dinner:
make a short shrift he longs to see your head 
o momentary grace of mortal men 
which we more hunt for than the grace of god 
who builds his hopes in air of your good looks 
lives like a drunken sailor on a mast 
ready with every nod to tumble down
into the fatal bowels of the deep 
lovel
come come dispatch tis bootless to exclaim 
o bloody richard miserable england 
i prophesy the fearful st time to thee
that ever wretched age hath look d upon 
come lead me to the block bear him my head 
they smile at me that shortly shall be dead 
come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour 
murder thy breath in the middle of a word 
and then begin again and stop again 
as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror 
tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian 
speak and look back and pry on every side 
tremble and start at wagging of a straw 
intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
are at my service like enforced smiles 
and both are ready in their offices 
at any time to grace my stratagems 
but what is catesby gone 
he is and see he brings the mayor along 
lord mayor 
look to the drawbridge there 
hark a drum 
catesby o erlook the walls 
lord mayor the reason we have sent 
look back defend thee here are enemies 
god and our innocency defend and guard us 
be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel 
lovel
here is the head of that ignoble traitor 
the dangerous and unsuspected hastings 
so dear i loved the man that i must weep 
i took him for the plainest harmless creature
that breathed upon this earth a christian 
made him my book wherein my soul recorded
the history of all her secret thoughts:
so smooth he daub d his vice with show of virtue 
that his apparent open guilt omitted 
i mean his conversation with shore s wife 
he lived from all attainder of suspect 
well well he was the covert st shelter d traitor
that ever lived 
would you imagine or almost believe 
were t not that by great preservation 
we live to tell it you the subtle traitor
this day had plotted in the council-house
to murder me and my good lord of gloucester 
lord mayor
what had he so 
what think you we are turks or infidels 
or that we would against the form of law 
proceed thus rashly to the villain s death 
but that the extreme peril of the case 
the peace of england and our persons safety 
enforced us to this execution 
lord mayor
now fair befall you he deserved his death 
and you my good lords both have well proceeded 
to warn false traitors from the like attempts 
i never look d for better at his hands 
after he once fell in with mistress shore 
yet had not we determined he should die 
until your lordship came to see his death 
which now the loving haste of these our friends 
somewhat against our meaning have prevented:
because my lord we would have had you heard
the traitor speak and timorously confess
the manner and the purpose of his treason 
that you might well have signified the same
unto the citizens who haply may
misconstrue us in him and wail his death 
lord mayor
but my good lord your grace s word shall serve 
as well as i had seen and heard him speak
and doubt you not right noble princes both 
but i ll acquaint our duteous citizens
with all your just proceedings in this cause 
and to that end we wish d your lord-ship here 
to avoid the carping censures of the world 
but since you come too late of our intents 
yet witness what you hear we did intend:
and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell 
go after after cousin buckingham 
the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post:
there at your meet st advantage of the time 
infer the bastardy of edward s children:
tell them how edward put to death a citizen 
only for saying he would make his son
heir to the crown meaning indeed his house 
which by the sign thereof was termed so 
moreover urge his hateful luxury
and bestial appetite in change of lust 
which stretched to their servants daughters wives 
even where his lustful eye or savage heart 
without control listed to make his prey 
nay for a need thus far come near my person:
tell them when that my mother went with child
of that unsatiate edward noble york
my princely father then had wars in france
and by just computation of the time 
found that the issue was not his begot 
which well appeared in his lineaments 
being nothing like the noble duke my father:
but touch this sparingly as twere far off 
because you know my lord my mother lives 
fear not my lord i ll play the orator
as if the golden fee for which i plead
were for myself: and so my lord adieu 
if you thrive well bring them to baynard s castle 
where you shall find me well accompanied
with reverend fathers and well-learned bishops 
i go: and towards three or four o clock
look for the news that the guildhall affords 
go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw 
go thou to friar penker bid them both
meet me within this hour at baynard s castle 
now will i in to take some privy order 
to draw the brats of clarence out of sight 
and to give notice that no manner of person
at any time have recourse unto the princes 
scrivener
this is the indictment of the good lord hastings 
which in a set hand fairly is engross d 
that it may be this day read over in paul s 
and mark how well the sequel hangs together:
eleven hours i spent to write it over 
for yesternight by catesby was it brought me 
the precedent was full as long a-doing:
and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings 
untainted unexamined free at liberty
here s a good world the while why who s so gross 
that seeth not this palpable device 
yet who s so blind but says he sees it not 
bad is the world and all will come to nought 
when such bad dealings must be seen in thought 
how now my lord what say the citizens 
now by the holy mother of our lord 
the citizens are mum and speak not a word 
touch d you the bastardy of edward s children 
i did with his contract with lady lucy 
and his contract by deputy in france 
the insatiate greediness of his desires 
and his enforcement of the city wives 
his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy 
as being got your father then in france 
his resemblance being not like the duke 
withal i did infer your lineaments 
being the right idea of your father 
both in your form and nobleness of mind 
laid open all your victories in scotland 
your dicipline in war wisdom in peace 
your bounty virtue fair humility:
indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose
untouch d or slightly handled in discourse
and when mine oratory grew to an end
i bid them that did love their country s good
cry god save richard england s royal king 
ah and did they so 
no so god help me they spake not a word 
but like dumb statues or breathing stones 
gazed each on other and look d deadly pale 
which when i saw i reprehended them 
and ask d the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
his answer was the people were not wont
to be spoke to but by the recorder 
then he was urged to tell my tale again 
thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferr d 
but nothing spake in warrant from himself 
when he had done some followers of mine own 
at the lower end of the hall hurl d up their caps 
and some ten voices cried god save king richard 
and thus i took the vantage of those few 
thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i 
this general applause and loving shout
argues your wisdoms and your love to richard: 
and even here brake off and came away 
what tongueless blocks were they would not they speak 
no by my troth my lord 
will not the mayor then and his brethren come 
the mayor is here at hand: intend some fear 
be not you spoke with but by mighty suit:
and look you get a prayer-book in your hand 
and stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord 
for on that ground i ll build a holy descant:
and be not easily won to our request:
play the maid s part still answer nay and take it 
i go and if you plead as well for them
as i can say nay to thee for myself 
no doubt well bring it to a happy issue 
go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks 
welcome my lord i dance attendance here 
i think the duke will not be spoke withal 
here comes his servant: how now catesby 
what says he 
my lord: he doth entreat your grace 
to visit him to-morrow or next day:
he is within with two right reverend fathers 
divinely bent to meditation 
and no worldly suit would he be moved 
to draw him from his holy exercise 
return good catesby to thy lord again 
tell him myself the mayor and citizens 
in deep designs and matters of great moment 
no less importing than our general good 
are come to have some conference with his grace 
i ll tell him what you say my lord 
ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward 
he is not lolling on a lewd day-bed 
but on his knees at meditation 
not dallying with a brace of courtezans 
but meditating with two deep divines 
not sleeping to engross his idle body 
but praying to enrich his watchful soul:
happy were england would this gracious prince
take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
but sure i fear we shall ne er win him to it 
marry god forbid his grace should say us nay 
i fear he will 
how now catesby what says your lord 
my lord 
he wonders to what end you have assembled
such troops of citizens to speak with him 
his grace not being warn d thereof before:
my lord he fears you mean no good to him 
sorry i am my noble cousin should
suspect me that i mean no good to him:
by heaven i come in perfect love to him 
and so once more return and tell his grace 
when holy and devout religious men
are at their beads tis hard to draw them thence 
so sweet is zealous contemplation 
see where he stands between two clergymen 
two props of virtue for a christian prince 
to stay him from the fall of vanity:
and see a book of prayer in his hand 
true ornaments to know a holy man 
famous plantagenet most gracious prince 
lend favourable ears to our request 
and pardon us the interruption
of thy devotion and right christian zeal 
my lord there needs no such apology:
i rather do beseech you pardon me 
who earnest in the service of my god 
neglect the visitation of my friends 
but leaving this what is your grace s pleasure 
even that i hope which pleaseth god above 
and all good men of this ungovern d isle 
i do suspect i have done some offence
that seems disgracious in the city s eyes 
and that you come to reprehend my ignorance 
you have my lord: would it might please your grace 
at our entreaties to amend that fault 
else wherefore breathe i in a christian land 
then know it is your fault that you resign
the supreme seat the throne majestical 
the scepter d office of your ancestors 
your state of fortune and your due of birth 
the lineal glory of your royal house 
to the corruption of a blemished stock:
whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts 
which here we waken to our country s good 
this noble isle doth want her proper limbs 
her face defaced with scars of infamy 
her royal stock graft with ignoble plants 
and almost shoulder d in the swallowing gulf
of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion 
which to recure we heartily solicit
your gracious self to take on you the charge
and kingly government of this your land 
not as protector steward substitute 
or lowly factor for another s gain 
but as successively from blood to blood 
your right of birth your empery your own 
for this consorted with the citizens 
your very worshipful and loving friends 
and by their vehement instigation 
in this just suit come i to move your grace 
i know not whether to depart in silence 
or bitterly to speak in your reproof 
best fitteth my degree or your condition
if not to answer you might haply think
tongue-tied ambition not replying yielded
to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty 
which fondly you would here impose on me 
if to reprove you for this suit of yours 
so season d with your faithful love to me 
then on the other side i cheque d my friends 
therefore to speak and to avoid the first 
and then in speaking not to incur the last 
definitively thus i answer you 
your love deserves my thanks but my desert
unmeritable shuns your high request 
first if all obstacles were cut away 
and that my path were even to the crown 
as my ripe revenue and due by birth
yet so much is my poverty of spirit 
so mighty and so many my defects 
as i had rather hide me from my greatness 
being a bark to brook no mighty sea 
than in my greatness covet to be hid 
and in the vapour of my glory smother d 
but god be thank d there s no need of me 
and much i need to help you if need were 
the royal tree hath left us royal fruit 
which mellow d by the stealing hours of time 
will well become the seat of majesty 
and make no doubt us happy by his reign 
on him i lay what you would lay on me 
the right and fortune of his happy stars 
which god defend that i should wring from him 
my lord this argues conscience in your grace 
but the respects thereof are nice and trivial 
all circumstances well considered 
you say that edward is your brother s son:
so say we too but not by edward s wife 
for first he was contract to lady lucy 
your mother lives a witness to that vow 
and afterward by substitute betroth d
to bona sister to the king of france 
these both put by a poor petitioner 
a care-crazed mother of a many children 
a beauty-waning and distressed widow 
even in the afternoon of her best days 
made prize and purchase of his lustful eye 
seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
to base declension and loathed bigamy
by her in his unlawful bed he got
this edward whom our manners term the prince 
more bitterly could i expostulate 
save that for reverence to some alive 
i give a sparing limit to my tongue 
then good my lord take to your royal self
this proffer d benefit of dignity 
if non to bless us and the land withal 
yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
from the corruption of abusing times 
unto a lineal true-derived course 
male 
do good my lord your citizens entreat you 
refuse not mighty lord this proffer d love 
o make them joyful grant their lawful suit 
alas why would you heap these cares on me 
i am unfit for state and majesty 
i do beseech you take it not amiss 
i cannot nor i will not yield to you 
if you refuse it as in love and zeal 
loath to depose the child your brother s son 
as well we know your tenderness of heart
and gentle kind effeminate remorse 
which we have noted in you to your kin 
and egally indeed to all estates 
yet whether you accept our suit or no 
your brother s son shall never reign our king 
but we will plant some other in the throne 
to the disgrace and downfall of your house:
and in this resolution here we leave you 
come citizens: zounds i ll entreat no more 
o do not swear my lord of buckingham 
call them again my lord and accept their suit 
another
do good my lord lest all the land do rue it 
would you enforce me to a world of care 
well call them again i am not made of stone 
but penetrable to your kind entreats 
albeit against my conscience and my soul 
cousin of buckingham and you sage grave men 
since you will buckle fortune on my back 
to bear her burthen whether i will or no 
i must have patience to endure the load:
but if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
attend the sequel of your imposition 
your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
from all the impure blots and stains thereof 
for god he knows and you may partly see 
how far i am from the desire thereof 
male 
god bless your grace we see it and will say it 
in saying so you shall but say the truth 
then i salute you with this kingly title:
long live richard england s royal king 
male citizens

even when you please since you will have it so 
to-morrow then we will attend your grace:
and so most joyfully we take our leave 
come let us to our holy task again 
farewell good cousin farewell gentle friends 
let me but meet you ladies one hour hence 
and i ll salute your grace of york as mother 
and reverend looker on of two fair queens 
come madam you must straight to westminster 
there to be crowned richard s royal queen 
be of good cheer: mother how fares your grace 
full of wise care is this your counsel madam 
take all the swift advantage of the hours 
you shall have letters from me to my son
to meet you on the way and welcome you 
be not ta en tardy by unwise delay 
come madam come i in all haste was sent 
stand all apart cousin of buckingham 
my gracious sovereign 
give me thy hand 
thus high by thy advice
and thy assistance is king richard seated 
but shall we wear these honours for a day 
or shall they last and we rejoice in them 
still live they and for ever may they last 
o buckingham now do i play the touch 
to try if thou be current gold indeed
young edward lives: think now what i would say 
say on my loving lord 
why buckingham i say i would be king 
why so you are my thrice renowned liege 
ha am i king tis so: but edward lives 
true noble prince 
o bitter consequence 
that edward still should live true noble prince 
cousin thou wert not wont to be so dull:
shall i be plain i wish the bastards dead 
and i would have it suddenly perform d 
what sayest thou speak suddenly be brief 
your grace may do your pleasure 
tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezeth:
say have i thy consent that they shall die 
give me some breath some little pause my lord
before i positively herein:
i will resolve your grace immediately 
[aside to a stander by]
the king is angry: see he bites the lip 
i will converse with iron-witted fools
and unrespective boys: none are for me
that look into me with considerate eyes:
high-reaching buckingham grows circumspect 
boy 
page
my lord 
know st thou not any whom corrupting gold
would tempt unto a close exploit of death 
page
my lord i know a discontented gentleman 
whose humble means match not his haughty mind:
gold were as good as twenty orators 
and will no doubt tempt him to any thing 
what is his name 
page
his name my lord is tyrrel 
i partly know the man: go call him hither 
the deep-revolving witty buckingham
no more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:
hath he so long held out with me untired 
and stops he now for breath 
how now what news with you 
my lord i hear the marquis dorset s fled
to richmond in those parts beyond the sea
where he abides 
catesby 
my lord 
rumour it abroad
that anne my wife is sick and like to die:
i will take order for her keeping close 
inquire me out some mean-born gentleman 
whom i will marry straight to clarence daughter:
the boy is foolish and i fear not him 
look how thou dream st i say again give out
that anne my wife is sick and like to die:
about it for it stands me much upon 
to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me 
i must be married to my brother s daughter 
or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass 
murder her brothers and then marry her 
uncertain way of gain but i am in
so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye 
is thy name tyrrel 
james tyrrel and your most obedient subject 
art thou indeed 
prove me my gracious sovereign 
darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine 
ay my lord 
but i had rather kill two enemies 
why there thou hast it: two deep enemies 
foes to my rest and my sweet sleep s disturbers
are they that i would have thee deal upon:
tyrrel i mean those bastards in the tower 
let me have open means to come to them 
and soon i ll rid you from the fear of them 
thou sing st sweet music hark come hither tyrrel
go by this token: rise and lend thine ear:
there is no more but so: say it is done 
and i will love thee and prefer thee too 
tis done my gracious lord 
shall we hear from thee tyrrel ere we sleep 
ye shall my lord 
my lord i have consider d in my mind
the late demand that you did sound me in 
well let that pass dorset is fled to richmond 
i hear that news my lord 
stanley he is your wife s son well look to it 
my lord i claim your gift my due by promise 
for which your honour and your faith is pawn d 
the earldom of hereford and the moveables
the which you promised i should possess 
stanley look to your wife if she convey
letters to richmond you shall answer it 
what says your highness to my just demand 
as i remember henry the sixth
did prophesy that richmond should be king 
when richmond was a little peevish boy 
a king perhaps perhaps 
my lord 
how chance the prophet could not at that time
have told me i being by that i should kill him 
my lord your promise for the earldom 
richmond when last i was at exeter 
the mayor in courtesy show d me the castle 
and call d it rougemont: at which name i started 
because a bard of ireland told me once
i should not live long after i saw richmond 
my lord 
ay what s o clock 
i am thus bold to put your grace in mind
of what you promised me 
well but what s o clock 
upon the stroke of ten 
well let it strike 
why let it strike 
because that like a jack thou keep st the stroke
betwixt thy begging and my meditation 
i am not in the giving vein to-day 
why then resolve me whether you will or no 
tut tut 
thou troublest me am not in the vein 
is it even so rewards he my true service
with such deep contempt made i him king for this 
o let me think on hastings and be gone
to brecknock while my fearful head is on 
the tyrannous and bloody deed is done 
the most arch of piteous massacre
that ever yet this land was guilty of 
dighton and forrest whom i did suborn
to do this ruthless piece of butchery 
although they were flesh d villains bloody dogs 
melting with tenderness and kind compassion
wept like two children in their deaths sad stories 
lo thus quoth dighton lay those tender babes: 
thus thus quoth forrest girdling one another
within their innocent alabaster arms:
their lips were four red roses on a stalk 
which in their summer beauty kiss d each other 
a book of prayers on their pillow lay 
which once quoth forrest almost changed my mind 
but o the devil there the villain stopp d
whilst dighton thus told on: we smothered
the most replenished sweet work of nature 
that from the prime creation e er she framed 
thus both are gone with conscience and remorse 
they could not speak and so i left them both 
to bring this tidings to the bloody king 
and here he comes 
all hail my sovereign liege 
kind tyrrel am i happy in thy news 
if to have done the thing you gave in charge
beget your happiness be happy then 
for it is done my lord 
but didst thou see them dead 
i did my lord 
and buried gentle tyrrel 
the chaplain of the tower hath buried them 
but how or in what place i do not know 
come to me tyrrel soon at after supper 
and thou shalt tell the process of their death 
meantime but think how i may do thee good 
and be inheritor of thy desire 
farewell till soon 
the son of clarence have i pent up close 
his daughter meanly have i match d in marriage 
the sons of edward sleep in abraham s bosom 
and anne my wife hath bid the world good night 
now for i know the breton richmond aims
at young elizabeth my brother s daughter 
and by that knot looks proudly o er the crown 
to her i go a jolly thriving wooer 
my lord 
good news or bad that thou comest in so bluntly 
bad news my lord: ely is fled to richmond 
and buckingham back d with the hardy welshmen 
is in the field and still his power increaseth 
ely with richmond troubles me more near
than buckingham and his rash-levied army 
come i have heard that fearful commenting
is leaden servitor to dull delay 
delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
then fiery expedition be my wing 
jove s mercury and herald for a king 
come muster men: my counsel is my shield 
we must be brief when traitors brave the field 
who intercepts my expedition 
a flourish trumpets strike alarum drums 
let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
rail on the lord s enointed: strike i say 
either be patient and entreat me fair 
or with the clamorous report of war
thus will i drown your exclamations 
ay i thank god my father and yourself 
madam i have a touch of your condition 
which cannot brook the accent of reproof 
do then: but i ll not hear 
and brief good mother for i am in haste 
and came i not at last to comfort you 
faith none but humphrey hour that call d
your grace
to breakfast once forth of my company 
if i be so disgracious in your sight 
let me march on and not offend your grace 
strike the drum 
you speak too bitterly 
so 
stay madam i must speak a word with you 
you have a daughter call d elizabeth 
virtuous and fair royal and gracious 
wrong not her birth she is of royal blood 
her life is only safest in her birth 
lo at their births good stars were opposite 
all unavoided is the doom of destiny 
you speak as if that i had slain my cousins 
madam so thrive i in my enterprise
and dangerous success of bloody wars 
as i intend more good to you and yours 
than ever you or yours were by me wrong d 
the advancement of your children gentle lady 
no to the dignity and height of honour
the high imperial type of this earth s glory 
even all i have yea and myself and all 
will i withal endow a child of thine 
so in the lethe of thy angry soul
thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
which thou supposest i have done to thee 
then know that from my soul i love thy daughter 
what do you think 
be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
i mean that with my soul i love thy daughter 
and mean to make her queen of england 
even he that makes her queen who should be else 
i even i: what think you of it madam 
that would i learn of you 
as one that are best acquainted with her humour 
madam with all my heart 
come come you mock me this is not the way
to win our daughter 
say that i did all this for love of her 
look what is done cannot be now amended:
men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes 
which after hours give leisure to repent 
if i did take the kingdom from your sons 
to make amends ill give it to your daughter 
if i have kill d the issue of your womb 
to quicken your increase i will beget
mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
a grandam s name is little less in love
than is the doting title of a mother 
they are as children but one step below 
even of your mettle of your very blood 
of an one pain save for a night of groans
endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow 
your children were vexation to your youth 
but mine shall be a comfort to your age 
the loss you have is but a son being king 
and by that loss your daughter is made queen 
i cannot make you what amends i would 
therefore accept such kindness as i can 
dorset your son that with a fearful soul
leads discontented steps in foreign soil 
this fair alliance quickly shall call home
to high promotions and great dignity:
the king that calls your beauteous daughter wife 
familiarly shall call thy dorset brother 
again shall you be mother to a king 
and all the ruins of distressful times
repair d with double riches of content 
what we have many goodly days to see:
the liquid drops of tears that you have shed
shall come again transform d to orient pearl 
advantaging their loan with interest
of ten times double gain of happiness 
go then my mother to thy daughter go
make bold her bashful years with your experience 
prepare her ears to hear a wooer s tale
put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
of golden sovereignty acquaint the princess
with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
and when this arm of mine hath chastised
the petty rebel dull-brain d buckingham 
bound with triumphant garlands will i come
and lead thy daughter to a conqueror s bed 
to whom i will retail my conquest won 
and she shall be sole victress caesar s caesar 
infer fair england s peace by this alliance 
say that the king which may command entreats 
say she shall be a high and mighty queen 
say i will love her everlastingly 
sweetly in force unto her fair life s end 
so long as heaven and nature lengthens it 
say i her sovereign am her subject love 
be eloquent in my behalf to her 
then in plain terms tell her my loving tale 
your reasons are too shallow and too quick 
harp not on that string madam that is past 
now by my george my garter and my crown 
i swear 
now by the world 
my father s death 
then by myself 
why then by god 
the time to come 
as i intend to prosper and repent 
so thrive i in my dangerous attempt
of hostile arms myself myself confound 
heaven and fortune bar me happy hours 
day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest 
be opposite all planets of good luck
to my proceedings if with pure heart s love 
immaculate devotion holy thoughts 
i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter 
in her consists my happiness and thine 
without her follows to this land and me 
to thee herself and many a christian soul 
death desolation ruin and decay:
it cannot be avoided but by this 
it will not be avoided but by this 
therefore good mother i must can you so 
be the attorney of my love to her:
plead what i will be not what i have been 
not my deserts but what i will deserve:
urge the necessity and state of times 
and be not peevish-fond in great designs 
ay if the devil tempt thee to do good 
ay if yourself s remembrance wrong yourself 
but in your daughter s womb i bury them:
where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
selves of themselves to your recomforture 
and be a happy mother by the deed 
bear her my true love s kiss and so farewell 
relenting fool and shallow changing woman 
how now what news 
my gracious sovereign on the western coast

unarm d and unresolved to beat them back:

and there they hull expecting but the aid
of buckingham to welcome them ashore 
some light-foot friend post to the duke of norfolk:

when thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way 
once more what news

white-liver d runagate what doth he there

what heir of york is there alive but we 
and who is england s king but great york s heir 
then tell me what doth he upon the sea 
unless for that my liege i cannot guess 
unless for that he comes to be your liege 
you cannot guess wherefore the welshman comes 
thou wilt revolt and fly to him i fear 
no mighty liege therefore mistrust me not 
where is thy power then to beat him back 
where are thy tenants and thy followers 
are they not now upon the western shore 
safe-conducting the rebels from their ships 
no my good lord my friends are in the north 
cold friends to richard: what do they in the north 
when they should serve their sovereign in the west 
they have not been commanded mighty sovereign:
please it your majesty to give me leave 
i ll muster up my friends and meet your grace
where and what time your majesty shall please 
ay ay thou wouldst be gone to join with richmond:
i will not trust you sir 
most mighty sovereign 
you have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:
i never was nor never will be false 
well 
go muster men but hear you leave behind
your son george stanley: look your faith be firm 
or else his head s assurance is but frail 
so deal with him as i prove true to you

bishop of exeter his brother there 
with many more confederates are in arms 
second male

and every hour more competitors
flock to their aid and still their power increaseth 
second male

take that until thou bring me better news 
second male
the news i have to tell your majesty
is that by sudden floods and fall of waters 
buckingham s army is dispersed and scatter d 
and he himself wander d away alone 
no man knows whither 
i cry thee mercy:
there is my purse to cure that blow of thine 
hath any well-advised friend proclaim d
reward to him that brings the traitor in 
second male
such proclamation hath been made my liege 
fourth male 
sir thomas lovel and lord marquis dorset 
tis said my liege in yorkshire are in arms 
yet this good comfort bring i to your grace 
the breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
richmond in yorkshire sent out a boat
unto the shore to ask those on the banks
if they were his assistants yea or no 
who answer d him they came from buckingham 
upon his party: he mistrusting them 
hoisted sail and made away for brittany 
march on march on since we are up in arms 
if not to fight with foreign enemies 
yet to beat down these rebels here at home 
my liege the duke of buckingham is taken 
that is the best news: that the earl of richmond
is with a mighty power landed at milford 
is colder tidings yet they must be told 
away towards salisbury while we reason here 
a royal battle might be won and lost
some one take order buckingham be brought
to salisbury the rest march on with me 
derby

christopher
sir walter herbert a renowned soldier 
sir gilbert talbot sir william stanley 
oxford redoubted pembroke sir james blunt 
and rice ap thomas with a valiant crew 
and many more of noble fame and worth:
and towards london they do bend their course 
if by the way they be not fought withal 
derby

these letters will resolve him of my mind farewell 
will not king richard let me speak with him 
sheriff

hastings and edward s children rivers grey 
holy king henry and thy fair son edward 
vaughan and all that have miscarried
by underhand corrupted foul injustice 
if that your moody discontented souls
do through the clouds behold this present hour 
even for revenge mock my destruction 
this is all-souls day fellows is it not 
sherriff
it is my lord 
why then all-souls day is my body s doomsday 
this is the day that in king edward s time 
i wish t might fall on me when i was found
false to his children or his wife s allies
this is the day wherein i wish d to fall
by the false faith of him i trusted most 
this this all-souls day to my fearful soul
is the determined respite of my wrongs:
that high all-seer that i dallied with
hath turn d my feigned prayer on my head
and given in earnest what i begg d in jest 
thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
to turn their own points on their masters bosoms:
now margaret s curse is fallen upon my head 
when he quoth she shall split thy heart with sorrow 
remember margaret was a prophetess 
come sirs convey me to the block of shame 
wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame 
fellows in arms and my most loving friends 
bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny 
thus far into the bowels of the land
have we march d on without impediment 
and here receive we from our father stanley
lines of fair comfort and encouragement 
the wretched bloody and usurping boar 
that spoil d your summer fields and fruitful vines 
swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough
in your embowell d bosoms this foul swine
lies now even in the centre of this isle 
near to the town of leicester as we learn
from tamworth thither is but one day s march 
in god s name cheerly on courageous friends 
to reap the harvest of perpetual peace
by this one bloody trial of sharp war 
oxford
every man s conscience is a thousand swords 
to fight against that bloody homicide 
herbert
i doubt not but his friends will fly to us 
blunt
he hath no friends but who are friends for fear 
which in his greatest need will shrink from him 
all for our vantage then in god s name march:
true hope is swift and flies with swallow s wings:
kings it makes gods and meaner creatures kings 
here pitch our tents even here in bosworth field 
my lord of surrey why look you so sad 
surrey
my heart is ten times lighter than my looks

norfolk we must have knocks ha must we not 
we must both give and take my gracious lord 
up with my tent there here will i lie tonight 
but where to-morrow well all s one for that 
who hath descried the number of the foe 
six or seven thousand is their utmost power 
why our battalion trebles that account:
besides the king s name is a tower of strength 
which they upon the adverse party want 
up with my tent there valiant gentlemen 
let us survey the vantage of the field
call for some men of sound direction
let s want no discipline make no delay 
for lords to-morrow is a busy day 
the weary sun hath made a golden set 
and by the bright track of his fiery car 
gives signal of a goodly day to-morrow 
sir william brandon you shall bear my standard 
give me some ink and paper in my tent
i ll draw the form and model of our battle 
limit each leader to his several charge 
and part in just proportion our small strength

and you sir walter herbert stay with me 
the earl of pembroke keeps his regiment:
good captain blunt bear my good night to him
and by the second hour in the morning
desire the earl to see me in my tent:

where is lord stanley quarter d dost thou know 
blunt
unless i have mista en his colours much 
which well i am assured i have not done 
his regiment lies half a mile at least
south from the mighty power of the king 
if without peril it be possible 
good captain blunt bear my good-night to him 
and give him from me this most needful scroll 
blunt
upon my life my lord i ll under-take it 
and so god give you quiet rest to-night 
good night good captain blunt come gentlemen 
let us consult upon to-morrow s business

saddle white surrey for the field to-morrow 
look that my staves be sound and not too heavy 
ratcliff 
my lord 
saw st thou the melancholy lord northumberland 
thomas the earl of surrey and himself 
much about cock-shut time from troop to troop
went through the army cheering up the soldiers 
so i am satisfied give me a bowl of wine:
i have not that alacrity of spirit 
nor cheer of mind that i was wont to have 
set it down is ink and paper ready 
it is my lord 
bid my guard watch leave me 
ratcliff about the mid of night come to my tent
and help to arm me leave me i say 
derby
fortune and victory sit on thy helm 
all comfort that the dark night can afford
be to thy person noble father-in-law 
tell me how fares our loving mother 
derby
i by attorney bless thee from thy mother
who prays continually for richmond s good:
so much for that the silent hours steal on 
and flaky darkness breaks within the east 
in brief for so the season bids us be 
prepare thy battle early in the morning 
and put thy fortune to the arbitrement
of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war 
i as i may that which i would i cannot 
with best advantage will deceive the time 
and aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
but on thy side i may not be too forward
lest being seen thy brother tender george 
be executed in his father s sight 
farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
and ample interchange of sweet discourse 
which so long sunder d friends should dwell upon:
god give us leisure for these rites of love 
once more adieu: be valiant and speed well 
good lords conduct him to his regiment:
i ll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap 
lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow 
when i should mount with wings of victory:
once more good night kind lords and gentlemen 
exeunt all but male
o thou whose captain i account myself 
look on my forces with a gracious eye 
put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath 
that they may crush down with a heavy fall
the usurping helmets of our adversaries 
make us thy ministers of chastisement 
that we may praise thee in the victory 
to thee i do commend my watchful soul 
ere i let fall the windows of mine eyes:
sleeping and waking o defend me still 
let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow 
think how thou stab dst me in my prime of youth
at tewksbury: despair therefore and die 
be cheerful richmond for the wronged souls
of butcher d princes fight in thy behalf
king henry s issue richmond comforts thee 
male 
when i was mortal my anointed body
by thee was punched full of deadly holes
think on the tower and me: despair and die 
harry the sixth bids thee despair and die 
virtuous and holy be thou conqueror 
harry that prophesied thou shouldst be king 
doth comfort thee in thy sleep: live and flourish 
let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow 
i that was wash d to death with fulsome wine 
poor clarence by thy guile betrayed to death 
to-morrow in the battle think on me 
and fall thy edgeless sword: despair and die 
thou offspring of the house of lancaster
the wronged heirs of york do pray for thee
good angels guard thy battle live and flourish 
let me sit heavy on thy soul to-morrow 
rivers that died at pomfret despair and die 
think upon grey and let thy soul despair 
think upon vaughan and with guilty fear 
let fall thy lance: despair and die 
all
awake and think our wrongs in richard s bosom
will conquer him awake and win the day 
ghost of male
bloody and guilty guiltily awake 
and in a bloody battle end thy days 
think on lord hastings: despair and die 
quiet untroubled soul awake awake 
arm fight and conquer for fair england s sake 
dream on thy cousins smother d in the tower:
let us be led within thy bosom richard 
and weigh thee down to ruin shame and death 
thy nephews souls bid thee despair and die 
sleep richmond sleep in peace and wake in joy 
good angels guard thee from the boar s annoy 
live and beget a happy race of kings 
edward s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish 
give me another horse: bind up my wounds 
have mercy jesu soft i did but dream 
o coward conscience how dost thou afflict me 
the lights burn blue it is now dead midnight 
cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh 
what do i fear myself there s none else by:
richard loves richard that is i am i 
is there a murderer here no yes i am:
then fly what from myself great reason why:
lest i revenge what myself upon myself 
alack i love myself wherefore for any good
that i myself have done unto myself 
o no alas i rather hate myself
for hateful deeds committed by myself 
i am a villain: yet i lie i am not 
fool of thyself speak well: fool do not flatter 
my conscience hath a thousand several tongues 
and every tongue brings in a several tale 
and every tale condemns me for a villain 
perjury perjury in the high st degree
murder stem murder in the direst degree 
all several sins all used in each degree 
throng to the bar crying all guilty guilty 
i shall despair there is no creature loves me 
and if i die no soul shall pity me:
nay wherefore should they since that i myself
find in myself no pity to myself 
methought the souls of all that i had murder d
came to my tent and every one did threat
to-morrow s vengeance on the head of richard 
my lord 
zounds who is there 
ratcliff my lord tis i the early village-cock
hath twice done salutation to the morn 
your friends are up and buckle on their armour 
o ratcliff i have dream d a fearful dream 
what thinkest thou will our friends prove all true 
no doubt my lord 
o ratcliff i fear i fear 
nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows 
by the apostle paul shadows to-night
have struck more terror to the soul of richard
than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
armed in proof and led by shallow richmond 
it is not yet near day come go with me 
under our tents i ll play the eaves-dropper 
to see if any mean to shrink from me 
lords
good morrow richmond 
cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen 
that you have ta en a tardy sluggard here 
lords
how have you slept my lord 
the sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams
that ever enter d in a drowsy head 
have i since your departure had my lords 
methought their souls whose bodies richard murder d 
came to my tent and cried on victory:
i promise you my soul is very jocund
in the remembrance of so fair a dream 
how far into the morning is it lords 
lords
upon the stroke of four 
why then tis time to arm and give direction 
more than i have said loving countrymen 
the leisure and enforcement of the time
forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this 
god and our good cause fight upon our side 
the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls 
like high-rear d bulwarks stand before our faces 
richard except those whom we fight against
had rather have us win than him they follow:
for what is he they follow truly gentlemen 
a bloody tyrant and a homicide 
one raised in blood and one in blood establish d 
one that made means to come by what he hath 
and slaughter d those that were the means to help him 
abase foul stone made precious by the foil
of england s chair where he is falsely set 
one that hath ever been god s enemy:
then if you fight against god s enemy 
god will in justice ward you as his soldiers 
if you do sweat to put a tyrant down 
you sleep in peace the tyrant being slain 
if you do fight against your country s foes 
your country s fat shall pay your pains the hire 
if you do fight in safeguard of your wives 
your wives shall welcome home the conquerors 
if you do free your children from the sword 
your children s children quit it in your age 
then in the name of god and all these rights 
advance your standards draw your willing swords 
for me the ransom of my bold attempt
shall be this cold corpse on the earth s cold face 
but if i thrive the gain of my attempt
the least of you shall share his part thereof 
sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully 
god and saint george richmond and victory 
what said northumberland as touching richmond 
that he was never trained up in arms 
he said the truth: and what said surrey then 
he smiled and said the better for our purpose 
he was in the right and so indeed it is 
ten the clock there give me a calendar 
who saw the sun to-day 
not i my lord 
then he disdains to shine for by the book
he should have braved the east an hour ago
a black day will it be to somebody ratcliff 
my lord 
the sun will not be seen to-day 
the sky doth frown and lour upon our army 
i would these dewy tears were from the ground 
not shine to-day why what is that to me
more than to richmond for the selfsame heaven
that frowns on me looks sadly upon him 
arm arm my lord the foe vaunts in the field 
come bustle bustle caparison my horse 
call up lord stanley bid him bring his power:
i will lead forth my soldiers to the plain 
and thus my battle shall be ordered:
my foreward shall be drawn out all in length 
consisting equally of horse and foot 
our archers shall be placed in the midst
john duke of norfolk thomas earl of surrey 
shall have the leading of this foot and horse 
they thus directed we will follow
in the main battle whose puissance on either side
shall be well winged with our chiefest horse 
this and saint george to boot what think st thou norfolk 
a good direction warlike sovereign 
this found i on my tent this morning 
jockey of norfolk be not too bold 
for dickon thy master is bought and sold 
a thing devised by the enemy 
go gentleman every man unto his charge
let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:
conscience is but a word that cowards use 
devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
our strong arms be our conscience swords our law 
march on join bravely let us to t pell-mell
if not to heaven then hand in hand to hell 
what shall i say more than i have inferr d 
remember whom you are to cope withal 
a sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways 
a scum of bretons and base lackey peasants 
whom their o er-cloyed country vomits forth
to desperate ventures and assured destruction 
you sleeping safe they bring to you unrest 
you having lands and blest with beauteous wives 
they would restrain the one distain the other 
and who doth lead them but a paltry fellow 
long kept in bretagne at our mother s cost 
a milk-sop one that never in his life
felt so much cold as over shoes in snow 
let s whip these stragglers o er the seas again 
lash hence these overweening rags of france 
these famish d beggars weary of their lives 
who but for dreaming on this fond exploit 
for want of means poor rats had hang d themselves:
if we be conquer d let men conquer us 
and not these bastard bretons whom our fathers
have in their own land beaten bobb d and thump d 
and in record left them the heirs of shame 
shall these enjoy our lands lie with our wives 
ravish our daughters 
hark i hear their drum 
fight gentlemen of england fight bold yoemen 
draw archers draw your arrows to the head 
spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood 
amaze the welkin with your broken staves 
what says lord stanley will he bring his power 
my lord he doth deny to come 
off with his son george s head 
my lord the enemy is past the marsh
after the battle let george stanley die 
a thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
advance our standards set upon our foes
our ancient word of courage fair saint george 
inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons 
upon them victory sits on our helms 
rescue my lord of norfolk rescue rescue 
the king enacts more wonders than a man 
daring an opposite to every danger:
his horse is slain and all on foot he fights 
seeking for richmond in the throat of death 
rescue fair lord or else the day is lost 
a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse 
withdraw my lord i ll help you to a horse 
slave i have set my life upon a cast 
and i will stand the hazard of the die:
i think there be six richmonds in the field 
five have i slain to-day instead of him 
a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse 
god and your arms be praised victorious friends 
the day is ours the bloody dog is dead 
derby
courageous richmond well hast thou acquit thee 
lo here this long-usurped royalty
from the dead temples of this bloody wretch
have i pluck d off to grace thy brows withal:
wear it enjoy it and make much of it 
great god of heaven say amen to all 
but tell me is young george stanley living 
derby
he is my lord and safe in leicester town 
whither if it please you we may now withdraw us 
what men of name are slain on either side 
derby
john duke of norfolk walter lord ferrers 
sir robert brakenbury and sir william brandon 
inter their bodies as becomes their births:
proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
that in submission will return to us:
and then as we have ta en the sacrament 
we will unite the white rose and the red:
smile heaven upon this fair conjunction 
that long have frown d upon their enmity 
what traitor hears me and says not amen 
england hath long been mad and scarr d herself 
the brother blindly shed the brother s blood 
the father rashly slaughter d his own son 
the son compell d been butcher to the sire:
all this divided york and lancaster 
divided in their dire division 
o now let richmond and elizabeth 
the true succeeders of each royal house 
by god s fair ordinance conjoin together 
and let their heirs god if thy will be so 
enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace 
with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days 
abate the edge of traitors gracious lord 
that would reduce these bloody days again 
and make poor england weep in streams of blood 
let them not live to taste this land s increase
that would with treason wound this fair land s peace 
now civil wounds are stopp d peace lives again:
that she may long live here god say amen 
old john of gaunt time-honour d lancaster 
hast thou according to thy oath and band 
brought hither henry hereford thy bold son 
here to make good the boisterous late appeal 
which then our leisure would not let us hear 
against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray 
i have my liege 
tell me moreover hast thou sounded him 
if he appeal the duke on ancient malice 
or worthily as a good subject should 
on some known ground of treachery in him 
as near as i could sift him on that argument 
on some apparent danger seen in him
aim d at your highness no inveterate malice 
then call them to our presence face to face 
and frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear
the accuser and the accused freely speak:
high-stomach d are they both and full of ire 
in rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire 
many years of happy days befal
my gracious sovereign my most loving liege 
each day still better other s happiness 
until the heavens envying earth s good hap 
add an immortal title to your crown 
we thank you both: yet one but flatters us 
as well appeareth by the cause you come 
namely to appeal each other of high treason 
cousin of hereford what dost thou object
against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray 
first heaven be the record to my speech 
in the devotion of a subject s love 
tendering the precious safety of my prince 
and free from other misbegotten hate 
come i appellant to this princely presence 
now thomas mowbray do i turn to thee 
and mark my greeting well for what i speak
my body shall make good upon this earth 
or my divine soul answer it in heaven 
thou art a traitor and a miscreant 
too good to be so and too bad to live 
since the more fair and crystal is the sky 
the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly 
once more the more to aggravate the note 
with a foul traitor s name stuff i thy throat 
and wish so please my sovereign ere i move 
what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove 
let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
tis not the trial of a woman s war 
the bitter clamour of two eager tongues 
can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain 
the blood is hot that must be cool d for this:
yet can i not of such tame patience boast
as to be hush d and nought at all to say:
first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
from giving reins and spurs to my free speech 
which else would post until it had return d
these terms of treason doubled down his throat 
setting aside his high blood s royalty 
and let him be no kinsman to my liege 
i do defy him and i spit at him 
call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
which to maintain i would allow him odds 
and meet him were i tied to run afoot
even to the frozen ridges of the alps 
or any other ground inhabitable 
where ever englishman durst set his foot 
mean time let this defend my loyalty 
by all my hopes most falsely doth he lie 
pale trembling coward there i throw my gage 
disclaiming here the kindred of the king 
and lay aside my high blood s royalty 
which fear not reverence makes thee to except 
if guilty dread have left thee so much strength
as to take up mine honour s pawn then stoop:
by that and all the rites of knighthood else 
will i make good against thee arm to arm 
what i have spoke or thou canst worse devise 
i take it up and by that sword i swear
which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder 
i ll answer thee in any fair degree 
or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
and when i mount alive may i not light 
if i be traitor or unjustly fight 
what doth our cousin lay to mowbray s charge 
it must be great that can inherit us
so much as of a thought of ill in him 
look what i speak my life shall prove it true 
that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
in name of lendings for your highness soldiers 
the which he hath detain d for lewd employments 
like a false traitor and injurious villain 
besides i say and will in battle prove 
or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
that ever was survey d by english eye 
that all the treasons for these eighteen years
complotted and contrived in this land
fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring 
further i say and further will maintain
upon his bad life to make all this good 
that he did plot the duke of gloucester s death 
suggest his soon-believing adversaries 
and consequently like a traitor coward 
sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
which blood like sacrificing abel s cries 
even from the tongueless caverns of the earth 
to me for justice and rough chastisement 
and by the glorious worth of my descent 
this arm shall do it or this life be spent 
how high a pitch his resolution soars 
thomas of norfolk what say st thou to this 
o let my sovereign turn away his face
and bid his ears a little while be deaf 
till i have told this slander of his blood 
how god and good men hate so foul a liar 
mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears:
were he my brother nay my kingdom s heir 
as he is but my father s brother s son 
now by my sceptre s awe i make a vow 
such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
should nothing privilege him nor partialize
the unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
he is our subject mowbray so art thou:
free speech and fearless i to thee allow 
then bolingbroke as low as to thy heart 
through the false passage of thy throat thou liest 
three parts of that receipt i had for calais
disbursed i duly to his highness soldiers 
the other part reserved i by consent 
for that my sovereign liege was in my debt
upon remainder of a dear account 
since last i went to france to fetch his queen:
now swallow down that lie for gloucester s death 
i slew him not but to my own disgrace
neglected my sworn duty in that case 
for you my noble lord of lancaster 
the honourable father to my foe
once did i lay an ambush for your life 
a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
but ere i last received the sacrament
i did confess it and exactly begg d
your grace s pardon and i hope i had it 
this is my fault: as for the rest appeall d 
it issues from the rancour of a villain 
a recreant and most degenerate traitor
which in myself i boldly will defend 
and interchangeably hurl down my gage
upon this overweening traitor s foot 
to prove myself a loyal gentleman
even in the best blood chamber d in his bosom 
in haste whereof most heartily i pray
your highness to assign our trial day 
wrath-kindled gentlemen be ruled by me 
let s purge this choler without letting blood:
this we prescribe though no physician 
deep malice makes too deep incision 
forget forgive conclude and be agreed 
our doctors say this is no month to bleed 
good uncle let this end where it begun 
we ll calm the duke of norfolk you your son 
to be a make-peace shall become my age:
throw down my son the duke of norfolk s gage 
and norfolk throw down his 
when harry when 
obedience bids i should not bid again 
norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot 
myself i throw dread sovereign at thy foot 
my life thou shalt command but not my shame:
the one my duty owes but my fair name 
despite of death that lives upon my grave 
to dark dishonour s use thou shalt not have 
i am disgraced impeach d and baffled here 
pierced to the soul with slander s venom d spear 
the which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
which breathed this poison 
rage must be withstood:
give me his gage: lions make leopards tame 
yea but not change his spots: take but my shame 
and i resign my gage my dear dear lord 
the purest treasure mortal times afford
is spotless reputation: that away 
men are but gilded loam or painted clay 
a jewel in a ten-times-barr d-up chest
is a bold spirit in a loyal breast 
mine honour is my life both grow in one:
take honour from me and my life is done:
then dear my liege mine honour let me try 
in that i live and for that will i die 
cousin throw up your gage do you begin 
o god defend my soul from such deep sin 
shall i seem crest-fall n in my father s sight 
or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
before this out-dared dastard ere my tongue
shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong 
or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear
the slavish motive of recanting fear 
and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace 
where shame doth harbour even in mowbray s face 
we were not born to sue but to command 
which since we cannot do to make you friends 
be ready as your lives shall answer it 
at coventry upon saint lambert s day:
there shall your swords and lances arbitrate
the swelling difference of your settled hate:
since we can not atone you we shall see
justice design the victor s chivalry 
lord marshal command our officers at arms
be ready to direct these home alarms 
alas the part i had in woodstock s blood
doth more solicit me than your exclaims 
to stir against the butchers of his life 
but since correction lieth in those hands
which made the fault that we cannot correct 
put we our quarrel to the will of heaven 
who when they see the hours ripe on earth 
will rain hot vengeance on offenders heads 
god s is the quarrel for god s substitute 
his deputy anointed in his sight 
hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully 
let heaven revenge for i may never lift
an angry arm against his minister 
to god the widow s champion and defence 
sister farewell i must to coventry:
as much good stay with thee as go with me 
yea at all points and longs to enter in 
lord marshal
the duke of norfolk sprightfully and bold 
stays but the summons of the appellant s trumpet 
why then the champions are prepared and stay
for nothing but his majesty s approach 
marshal demand of yonder champion
the cause of his arrival here in arms:
ask him his name and orderly proceed
to swear him in the justice of his cause 
lord marshal
in god s name and the king s say who thou art
and why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms 
against what man thou comest and what thy quarrel:
speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath 
as so defend thee heaven and thy valour 
my name is thomas mowbray duke of norfolk 
who hither come engaged by my oath 
which god defend a knight should violate 
both to defend my loyalty and truth
to god my king and my succeeding issue 
against the duke of hereford that appeals me
and by the grace of god and this mine arm 
to prove him in defending of myself 
a traitor to my god my king and me:
and as i truly fight defend me heaven 
marshal ask yonder knight in arms 
both who he is and why he cometh hither
thus plated in habiliments of war 
and formally according to our law 
depose him in the justice of his cause 
lord marshal
what is thy name and wherefore comest thou hither 
before king richard in his royal lists 
against whom comest thou and what s thy quarrel 
speak like a true knight so defend thee heaven 
harry of hereford lancaster and derby
am i who ready here do stand in arms 
to prove by god s grace and my body s valour 
in lists on thomas mowbray duke of norfolk 
that he is a traitor foul and dangerous 
to god of heaven king richard and to me 
and as i truly fight defend me heaven 
lord marshal
on pain of death no person be so bold
or daring-hardy as to touch the lists 
except the marshal and such officers
appointed to direct these fair designs 
lord marshal let me kiss my sovereign s hand 
and bow my knee before his majesty:
for mowbray and myself are like two men
that vow a long and weary pilgrimage 
then let us take a ceremonious leave
and loving farewell of our several friends 
lord marshal
the appellant in all duty greets your highness 
and craves to kiss your hand and take his leave 
we will descend and fold him in our arms 
cousin of hereford as thy cause is right 
so be thy fortune in this royal fight 
farewell my blood which if to-day thou shed 
lament we may but not revenge thee dead 
o let no noble eye profane a tear
for me if i be gored with mowbray s spear:
as confident as is the falcon s flight
against a bird do i with mowbray fight 
my loving lord i take my leave of you 
of you my noble cousin lord aumerle 
not sick although i have to do with death 
but lusty young and cheerly drawing breath 
lo as at english feasts so i regreet
the daintiest last to make the end most sweet:
o thou the earthly author of my blood 
whose youthful spirit in me regenerate 
doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
to reach at victory above my head 
add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers 
and with thy blessings steel my lance s point 
that it may enter mowbray s waxen coat 
and furbish new the name of john a gaunt 
even in the lusty havior of his son 
god in thy good cause make thee prosperous 
be swift like lightning in the execution 
and let thy blows doubly redoubled 
fall like amazing thunder on the casque
of thy adverse pernicious enemy:
rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live 
mine innocency and saint george to thrive 
however god or fortune cast my lot 
there lives or dies true to king richard s throne 
a loyal just and upright gentleman:
never did captive with a freer heart
cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
his golden uncontroll d enfranchisement 
more than my dancing soul doth celebrate
this feast of battle with mine adversary 
most mighty liege and my companion peers 
take from my mouth the wish of happy years:
as gentle and as jocund as to jest
go i to fight: truth hath a quiet breast 
farewell my lord: securely i espy
virtue with valour couched in thine eye 
order the trial marshal and begin 
lord marshal
harry of hereford lancaster and derby 
receive thy lance and god defend the right 
strong as a tower in hope i cry amen 
lord marshal
go bear this lance to thomas duke of norfolk 
first herald
harry of hereford lancaster and derby 
stands here for god his sovereign and himself 
on pain to be found false and recreant 
to prove the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray 
a traitor to his god his king and him 
and dares him to set forward to the fight 
second herald
here standeth thomas mowbray duke of norfolk 
on pain to be found false and recreant 
both to defend himself and to approve
henry of hereford lancaster and derby 
to god his sovereign and to him disloyal 
courageously and with a free desire
attending but the signal to begin 
lord marshal
sound trumpets and set forward combatants 
stay the king hath thrown his warder down 
let them lay by their helmets and their spears 
and both return back to their chairs again:
withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound
while we return these dukes what we decree 
draw near 
and list what with our council we have done 
for that our kingdom s earth should not be soil d
with that dear blood which it hath fostered 
and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
of civil wounds plough d up with neighbours sword 
and for we think the eagle-winged pride
of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts 
with rival-hating envy set on you
to wake our peace which in our country s cradle
draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep 
which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums 
with harsh resounding trumpets dreadful bray 
and grating shock of wrathful iron arms 
might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
and make us wade even in our kindred s blood 
therefore we banish you our territories:
you cousin hereford upon pain of life 
till twice five summers have enrich d our fields
shall not regreet our fair dominions 
but tread the stranger paths of banishment 
your will be done: this must my comfort be 
sun that warms you here shall shine on me 
and those his golden beams to you here lent
shall point on me and gild my banishment 
norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom 
which i with some unwillingness pronounce:
the sly slow hours shall not determinate
the dateless limit of thy dear exile 
the hopeless word of never to return 
breathe i against thee upon pain of life 
a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege 
and all unlook d for from your highness mouth:
a dearer merit not so deep a maim
as to be cast forth in the common air 
have i deserved at your highness hands 
the language i have learn d these forty years 
my native english now i must forego:
and now my tongue s use is to me no more
than an unstringed viol or a harp 
or like a cunning instrument cased up 
or being open put into his hands
that knows no touch to tune the harmony:
within my mouth you have engaol d my tongue 
doubly portcullis d with my teeth and lips 
and dull unfeeling barren ignorance
is made my gaoler to attend on me 
i am too old to fawn upon a nurse 
too far in years to be a pupil now:
what is thy sentence then but speechless death 
which robs my tongue from breathing native breath 
it boots thee not to be compassionate:
after our sentence plaining comes too late 
then thus i turn me from my country s light 
to dwell in solemn shades of endless night 
return again and take an oath with thee 
lay on our royal sword your banish d hands 
swear by the duty that you owe to god 
our part therein we banish with yourselves 
to keep the oath that we administer:
you never shall so help you truth and god 
embrace each other s love in banishment 
nor never look upon each other s face 
nor never write regreet nor reconcile
this louring tempest of your home-bred hate 
nor never by advised purpose meet
to plot contrive or complot any ill
gainst us our state our subjects or our land 
i swear 
and i to keep all this 
norfolk so far as to mine enemy: 
by this time had the king permitted us 
one of our souls had wander d in the air 
banish d this frail sepulchre of our flesh 
as now our flesh is banish d from this land:
confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm 
since thou hast far to go bear not along
the clogging burthen of a guilty soul 
no bolingbroke: if ever i were traitor 
my name be blotted from the book of life 
and i from heaven banish d as from hence 
but what thou art god thou and i do know 
and all too soon i fear the king shall rue 
farewell my liege now no way can i stray 
save back to england all the world s my way 
uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes
i see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
hath from the number of his banish d years
pluck d four away 
six frozen winter spent 
return with welcome home from banishment 
how long a time lies in one little word 
four lagging winters and four wanton springs
end in a word: such is the breath of kings 
i thank my liege that in regard of me
he shortens four years of my son s exile:
but little vantage shall i reap thereby 
for ere the six years that he hath to spend
can change their moons and bring their times about
my oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
shall be extinct with age and endless night 
my inch of taper will be burnt and done 
and blindfold death not let me see my son 
why uncle thou hast many years to live 
but not a minute king that thou canst give:
shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow 
and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow 
thou canst help time to furrow me with age 
but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage 
thy word is current with him for my death 
but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath 
thy son is banish d upon good advice 
whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:
why at our justice seem st thou then to lour 
things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour 
you urged me as a judge but i had rather
you would have bid me argue like a father 
o had it been a stranger not my child 
to smooth his fault i should have been more mild:
a partial slander sought i to avoid 
and in the sentence my own life destroy d 
alas i look d when some of you should say 
i was too strict to make mine own away 
but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
against my will to do myself this wrong 
cousin farewell and uncle bid him so:
six years we banish him and he shall go 
cousin farewell: what presence must not know 
from where you do remain let paper show 
lord marshal
my lord no leave take i for i will ride 
as far as land will let me by your side 
o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words 
that thou return st no greeting to thy friends 
i have too few to take my leave of you 
when the tongue s office should be prodigal
to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart 
thy grief is but thy absence for a time 
joy absent grief is present for that time 
what is six winters they are quickly gone 
to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten 
call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure 
my heart will sigh when i miscall it so 
which finds it an inforced pilgrimage 
the sullen passage of thy weary steps
esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
the precious jewel of thy home return 
nay rather every tedious stride i make
will but remember me what a deal of world
i wander from the jewels that i love 
must i not serve a long apprenticehood
to foreign passages and in the end 
having my freedom boast of nothing else
but that i was a journeyman to grief 
all places that the eye of heaven visits
are to a wise man ports and happy havens 
teach thy necessity to reason thus 
there is no virtue like necessity 
think not the king did banish thee 
but thou the king woe doth the heavier sit 
where it perceives it is but faintly borne 
go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour
and not the king exiled thee or suppose
devouring pestilence hangs in our air
and thou art flying to a fresher clime:
look what thy soul holds dear imagine it
to lie that way thou go st not whence thou comest:
suppose the singing birds musicians 
the grass whereon thou tread st the presence strew d 
the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more
than a delightful measure or a dance 
for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
the man that mocks at it and sets it light 
o who can hold a fire in his hand
by thinking on the frosty caucasus 
or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
by bare imagination of a feast 
or wallow naked in december snow
by thinking on fantastic summer s heat 
o no the apprehension of the good
gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
fell sorrow s tooth doth never rankle more
than when he bites but lanceth not the sore 
come come my son i ll bring thee on thy way:
had i thy youth and cause i would not stay 
then england s ground farewell sweet soil adieu 
my mother and my nurse that bears me yet 
where er i wander boast of this i can 
though banish d yet a trueborn englishman 
we did observe cousin aumerle 
how far brought you high hereford on his way 
i brought high hereford if you call him so 
but to the next highway and there i left him 
and say what store of parting tears were shed 
faith none for me except the north-east wind 
which then blew bitterly against our faces 
awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance
did grace our hollow parting with a tear 
what said our cousin when you parted with him 
farewell: 
and for my heart disdained that my tongue
should so profane the word that taught me craft
to counterfeit oppression of such grief
that words seem d buried in my sorrow s grave 
marry would the word farewell have lengthen d hours
and added years to his short banishment 
he should have had a volume of farewells 
but since it would not he had none of me 
he is our cousin cousin but tis doubt 
when time shall call him home from banishment 
whether our kinsman come to see his friends 
ourself and bushy bagot here and green
observed his courtship to the common people 
how he did seem to dive into their hearts
with humble and familiar courtesy 
what reverence he did throw away on slaves 
wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
and patient underbearing of his fortune 
as twere to banish their affects with him 
off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench 
a brace of draymen bid god speed him well
and had the tribute of his supple knee 
with thanks my countrymen my loving friends 
as were our england in reversion his 
and he our subjects next degree in hope 
well he is gone and with him go these thoughts 
now for the rebels which stand out in ireland 
expedient manage must be made my liege 
ere further leisure yield them further means
for their advantage and your highness loss 
we will ourself in person to this war:
and for our coffers with too great a court
and liberal largess are grown somewhat light 
we are inforced to farm our royal realm 
the revenue whereof shall furnish us
for our affairs in hand: if that come short 
our substitutes at home shall have blank charters 
whereto when they shall know what men are rich 
they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
and send them after to supply our wants 
for we will make for ireland presently 
bushy what news 
old john of gaunt is grievous sick my lord 
suddenly taken and hath sent post haste
to entreat your majesty to visit him 
where lies he 
at ely house 
now put it god in the physician s mind
to help him to his grave immediately 
the lining of his coffers shall make coats
to deck our soldiers for these irish wars 
come gentlemen let s all go visit him:
pray god we may make haste and come too late 
will the king come that i may breathe my last
in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth 
vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath 
for all in vain comes counsel to his ear 
o but they say the tongues of dying men
enforce attention like deep harmony:
where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain 
for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain 
he that no more must say is listen d more
than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose 
more are men s ends mark d than their lives before:
the setting sun and music at the close 
as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last 
writ in remembrance more than things long past:
though richard my life s counsel would not hear 
my death s sad tale may yet undeaf his ear 
no it is stopp d with other flattering sounds 
as praises of whose taste the wise are fond 
lascivious metres to whose venom sound
the open ear of youth doth always listen 
report of fashions in proud italy 
whose manners still our tardy apish nation
limps after in base imitation 
where doth the world thrust forth a vanity 
so it be new there s no respect how vile 
that is not quickly buzzed into his ears 
then all too late comes counsel to be heard 
where will doth mutiny with wit s regard 
direct not him whose way himself will choose:
tis breath thou lack st and that breath wilt thou lose 
methinks i am a prophet new inspired
and thus expiring do foretell of him:
his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last 
for violent fires soon burn out themselves 
small showers last long but sudden storms are short 
he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes 
with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
light vanity insatiate cormorant 
consuming means soon preys upon itself 
this royal throne of kings this scepter d isle 
this earth of majesty this seat of mars 
this other eden demi-paradise 
this fortress built by nature for herself
against infection and the hand of war 
this happy breed of men this little world 
this precious stone set in the silver sea 
which serves it in the office of a wall 
or as a moat defensive to a house 
against the envy of less happier lands 
this blessed plot this earth this realm this england 
this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings 
fear d by their breed and famous by their birth 
renowned for their deeds as far from home 
for christian service and true chivalry 
as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry 
of the world s ransom blessed mary s son 
this land of such dear souls this dear dear land 
dear for her reputation through the world 
is now leased out i die pronouncing it 
like to a tenement or pelting farm:
england bound in with the triumphant sea
whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
of watery neptune is now bound in with shame 
with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:
that england that was wont to conquer others 
hath made a shameful conquest of itself 
ah would the scandal vanish with my life 
how happy then were my ensuing death 
the king is come: deal mildly with his youth 
for young hot colts being raged do rage the more 
what comfort man how is t with aged gaunt 
o how that name befits my composition 
old gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old:
within me grief hath kept a tedious fast 
and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt 
for sleeping england long time have i watch d 
watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt:
the pleasure that some fathers feed upon 
is my strict fast i mean my children s looks 
and therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt:
gaunt am i for the grave gaunt as a grave 
whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones 
can sick men play so nicely with their names 
no misery makes sport to mock itself:
since thou dost seek to kill my name in me 
i mock my name great king to flatter thee 
should dying men flatter with those that live 
no no men living flatter those that die 
thou now a-dying say st thou flatterest me 
o no thou diest though i the sicker be 
i am in health i breathe and see thee ill 
now he that made me knows i see thee ill 
ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill 
thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
wherein thou liest in reputation sick 
and thou too careless patient as thou art 
commit st thy anointed body to the cure
of those physicians that first wounded thee:
a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown 
whose compass is no bigger than thy head 
and yet incaged in so small a verge 
the waste is no whit lesser than thy land 
o had thy grandsire with a prophet s eye
seen how his son s son should destroy his sons 
from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame 
deposing thee before thou wert possess d 
which art possess d now to depose thyself 
why cousin wert thou regent of the world 
it were a shame to let this land by lease 
but for thy world enjoying but this land 
is it not more than shame to shame it so 
landlord of england art thou now not king:
thy state of law is bondslave to the law and thou 
a lunatic lean-witted fool 
presuming on an ague s privilege 
darest with thy frozen admonition
make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood
with fury from his native residence 
now by my seat s right royal majesty 
wert thou not brother to great edward s son 
this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders 
o spare me not my brother edward s son 
for that i was his father edward s son 
that blood already like the pelican 
hast thou tapp d out and drunkenly caroused:
my brother gloucester plain well-meaning soul 
whom fair befal in heaven mongst happy souls 
may be a precedent and witness good
that thou respect st not spilling edward s blood:
join with the present sickness that i have 
and thy unkindness be like crooked age 
to crop at once a too long wither d flower 
live in thy shame but die not shame with thee 
these words hereafter thy tormentors be 
convey me to my bed then to my grave:
love they to live that love and honour have 
and let them die that age and sullens have 
for both hast thou and both become the grave 
i do beseech your majesty impute his words
to wayward sickliness and age in him:
he loves you on my life and holds you dear
as harry duke of hereford were he here 
right you say true: as hereford s love so his 
as theirs so mine and all be as it is 
my liege old gaunt commends him to your majesty 
what says he 
nay nothing all is said
his tongue is now a stringless instrument 
words life and all old lancaster hath spent 
be york the next that must be bankrupt so 
though death be poor it ends a mortal woe 
the ripest fruit first falls and so doth he 
his time is spent our pilgrimage must be 
so much for that now for our irish wars:
we must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns 
which live like venom where no venom else
but only they have privilege to live 
and for these great affairs do ask some charge 
towards our assistance we do seize to us
the plate corn revenues and moveables 
whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possess d 
how long shall i be patient ah how long
shall tender duty make me suffer wrong 
not gloucester s death nor hereford s banishment
not gaunt s rebukes nor england s private wrongs 
nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke
about his marriage nor my own disgrace 
have ever made me sour my patient cheek 
or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign s face 
i am the last of noble edward s sons 
of whom thy father prince of wales was first:
in war was never lion raged more fierce 
in peace was never gentle lamb more mild 
than was that young and princely gentleman 
his face thou hast for even so look d he 
accomplish d with the number of thy hours 
but when he frown d it was against the french
and not against his friends his noble hand
did will what he did spend and spent not that
which his triumphant father s hand had won 
his hands were guilty of no kindred blood 
but bloody with the enemies of his kin 
o richard york is too far gone with grief 
or else he never would compare between 
why uncle what s the matter 
o my liege 
pardon me if you please if n ot i pleased
not to be pardon d am content withal 
seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
the royalties and rights of banish d hereford 
is not gaunt dead and doth not hereford live 
was not gaunt just and is not harry true 
did not the one deserve to have an heir 
is not his heir a well-deserving son 
take hereford s rights away and take from time
his charters and his customary rights 
let not to-morrow then ensue to-day 
be not thyself for how art thou a king
but by fair sequence and succession 
now afore god god forbid i say true 
if you do wrongfully seize hereford s rights 
call in the letters patent that he hath
by his attorneys-general to sue
his livery and deny his offer d homage 
you pluck a thousand dangers on your head 
you lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
and prick my tender patience to those thoughts
which honour and allegiance cannot think 
think what you will we seize into our hands
his plate his goods his money and his lands 
i ll not be by the while: my liege farewell:
what will ensue hereof there s none can tell 
but by bad courses may be understood
that their events can never fall out good 
go bushy to the earl of wiltshire straight:
bid him repair to us to ely house
to see this business to-morrow next
we will for ireland and tis time i trow:
and we create in absence of ourself 
our uncle york lord governor of england 
for he is just and always loved us well 
come on our queen: to-morrow must we part 
be merry for our time of stay is short
well lords the duke of lancaster is dead 
and living too for now his son is duke 
barely in title not in revenue 
richly in both if justice had her right 
my heart is great but it must break with silence 
ere t be disburden d with a liberal tongue 
nay speak thy mind and let him ne er speak more
that speaks thy words again to do thee harm 
tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford 
if it be so out with it boldly man 
quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him 
no good at all that i can do for him 
unless you call it good to pity him 
bereft and gelded of his patrimony 
now afore god tis shame such wrongs are borne
in him a royal prince and many moe
of noble blood in this declining land 
the king is not himself but basely led
by flatterers and what they will inform 
merely in hate gainst any of us all 
that will the king severely prosecute
gainst us our lives our children and our heirs 
the commons hath he pill d with grievous taxes 
and quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined
for ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts 
and daily new exactions are devised 
as blanks benevolences and i wot not what:
but what o god s name doth become of this 
wars have not wasted it for warr d he hath not 
but basely yielded upon compromise
that which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:
more hath he spent in peace than they in wars 
the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm 
the king s grown bankrupt like a broken man 
reproach and dissolution hangeth over him 
he hath not money for these irish wars 
his burthenous taxations notwithstanding 
but by the robbing of the banish d duke 
his noble kinsman: most degenerate king 
but lords we hear this fearful tempest sing 
yet see no shelter to avoid the storm 
we see the wind sit sore upon our sails 
and yet we strike not but securely perish 
we see the very wreck that we must suffer 
and unavoided is the danger now 
for suffering so the causes of our wreck 
not so even through the hollow eyes of death
i spy life peering but i dare not say
how near the tidings of our comfort is 
nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours 
be confident to speak northumberland:
we three are but thyself and speaking so 
thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold 
then thus: i have from port le blanc a bay
in brittany received intelligence
that harry duke of hereford rainold lord cobham 
that late broke from the duke of exeter 
his brother archbishop late of canterbury 
sir thomas erpingham sir john ramston 
sir john norbery sir robert waterton and francis quoint 
all these well furnish d by the duke of bretagne
with eight tall ships three thousand men of war 
are making hither with all due expedience
and shortly mean to touch our northern shore:
perhaps they had ere this but that they stay
the first departing of the king for ireland 
if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke 
imp out our drooping country s broken wing 
redeem from broking pawn the blemish d crown 
wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre s gilt
and make high majesty look like itself 
away with me in post to ravenspurgh 
but if you faint as fearing to do so 
stay and be secret and myself will go 
to horse to horse urge doubts to them that fear 
hold out my horse and i will first be there 
madam your majesty is too much sad:
you promised when you parted with the king 
to lay aside life-harming heaviness
and entertain a cheerful disposition 
each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows 
which shows like grief itself but is not so 
for sorrow s eye glazed with blinding tears 
divides one thing entire to many objects 
like perspectives which rightly gazed upon
show nothing but confusion eyed awry
distinguish form: so your sweet majesty 
looking awry upon your lord s departure 
find shapes of grief more than himself to wail 
which look d on as it is is nought but shadows
of what it is not then thrice-gracious queen 
more than your lord s departure weep not: more s not seen 
or if it be tis with false sorrow s eye 
which for things true weeps things imaginary 
tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady 
god save your majesty and well met gentlemen:
i hope the king is not yet shipp d for ireland 
that he our hope might have retired his power 
and driven into despair an enemy s hope 
who strongly hath set footing in this land:
the banish d bolingbroke repeals himself 
and with uplifted arms is safe arrived
at ravenspurgh 
ah madam tis too true: and that is worse 
the lord northumberland his son young henry percy 
the lords of ross beaumond and willoughby 
with all their powerful friends are fled to him 
why have you not proclaim d northumberland
and all the rest revolted faction traitors 
we have: whereupon the earl of worcester
hath broke his staff resign d his stewardship 
and all the household servants fled with him
to bolingbroke 
despair not madam 
here comes the duke of york 
should i do so i should belie my thoughts:
comfort s in heaven and we are on the earth 
where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief 
your husband he is gone to save far off 
whilst others come to make him lose at home:
here am i left to underprop his land 
who weak with age cannot support myself:
now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made 
now shall he try his friends that flatter d him 
servant
my lord your son was gone before i came 
he was why so go all which way it will 
the nobles they are fled the commons they are cold 
and will i fear revolt on hereford s side 
sirrah get thee to plashy to my sister gloucester 
bid her send me presently a thousand pound:
hold take my ring 
servant
my lord i had forgot to tell your lordship 
to-day as i came by i called there 
but i shall grieve you to report the rest 
what is t knave 
servant
an hour before i came the duchess died 
god for his mercy what a tide of woes
comes rushing on this woeful land at once 
i know not what to do: i would to god 
so my untruth had not provoked him to it 
the king had cut off my head with my brother s 
what are there no posts dispatch d for ireland 
how shall we do for money for these wars 
come sister cousin i would say pray pardon me 
go fellow get thee home provide some carts
and bring away the armour that is there 
gentlemen will you go muster men 
if i know how or which way to order these affairs
thus thrust disorderly into my hands 
never believe me both are my kinsmen:
the one is my sovereign whom both my oath
and duty bids defend the other again
is my kinsman whom the king hath wrong d 
whom conscience and my kindred bids to right 
well somewhat we must do come cousin i ll
dispose of you 
gentlemen go muster up your men 
and meet me presently at berkeley 
i should to plashy too 
but time will not permit: all is uneven 
and every thing is left at six and seven 
the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland 
but none returns for us to levy power
proportionable to the enemy
is all unpossible 
besides our nearness to the king in love
is near the hate of those love not the king 
and that s the wavering commons: for their love
lies in their purses and whoso empties them
by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate 
wherein the king stands generally condemn d 
if judgement lie in them then so do we 
because we ever have been near the king 
well i will for refuge straight to bristol castle:
the earl of wiltshire is already there 
thither will i with you for little office
the hateful commons will perform for us 
except like curs to tear us all to pieces 
will you go along with us 
no i will to ireland to his majesty 
farewell: if heart s presages be not vain 
we three here art that ne er shall meet again 
that s as york thrives to beat back bolingbroke 
alas poor duke the task he undertakes
is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
where one on his side fights thousands will fly 
farewell at once for once for all and ever 
well we may meet again 
i fear me never 
how far is it my lord to berkeley now 
believe me noble lord 
i am a stranger here in gloucestershire:
these high wild hills and rough uneven ways
draws out our miles and makes them wearisome 
and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar 
making the hard way sweet and delectable 
but i bethink me what a weary way
from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found
in ross and willoughby wanting your company 
which i protest hath very much beguiled
the tediousness and process of my travel:
but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
the present benefit which i possess 
and hope to joy is little less in joy
than hope enjoy d: by this the weary lords
shall make their way seem short as mine hath done
by sight of what i have your noble company 
of much less value is my company
than your good words but who comes here 
it is my son young harry percy 
sent from my brother worcester whencesoever 
harry how fares your uncle 
i had thought my lord to have learn d his health of you 
why is he not with the queen 
no my good lord he hath forsook the court 
broken his staff of office and dispersed
the household of the king 
what was his reason 
he was not so resolved when last we spake together 
because your lordship was proclaimed traitor 
but he my lord is gone to ravenspurgh 
to offer service to the duke of hereford 
and sent me over by berkeley to discover
what power the duke of york had levied there 
then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh 
have you forgot the duke of hereford boy 
no my good lord for that is not forgot
which ne er i did remember: to my knowledge 
i never in my life did look on him 
then learn to know him now this is the duke 
my gracious lord i tender you my service 
such as it is being tender raw and young:
which elder days shall ripen and confirm
to more approved service and desert 
i thank thee gentle percy and be sure
i count myself in nothing else so happy
as in a soul remembering my good friends 
and as my fortune ripens with thy love 
it shall be still thy true love s recompense:
my heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it 
how far is it to berkeley and what stir
keeps good old york there with his men of war 
there stands the castle by yon tuft of trees 
mann d with three hundred men as i have heard 
and in it are the lords of york berkeley and seymour 
none else of name and noble estimate 
here come the lords of ross and willoughby 
bloody with spurring fiery-red with haste 
welcome my lords i wot your love pursues
a banish d traitor: all my treasury
is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrich d
shall be your love and labour s recompense 
your presence makes us rich most noble lord 
and far surmounts our labour to attain it 
evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor 
which till my infant fortune comes to years 
stands for my bounty but who comes here 
it is my lord of berkeley as i guess 
my lord of hereford my message is to you 
my lord my answer is to lancaster 
and i am come to seek that name in england 
and i must find that title in your tongue 
before i make reply to aught you say 
mistake me not my lord tis not my meaning
to raze one title of your honour out:
to you my lord i come what lord you will 
from the most gracious regent of this land 
the duke of york to know what pricks you on
to take advantage of the absent time
and fright our native peace with self-born arms 
i shall not need transport my words by you 
here comes his grace in person my noble uncle 
show me thy humble heart and not thy knee 
whose duty is deceiveable and false 
my gracious uncle 
tut tut 
grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle:
i am no traitor s uncle and that word grace 
in an ungracious mouth is but profane 
why have those banish d and forbidden legs
dared once to touch a dust of england s ground 
but then more why why have they dared to march
so many miles upon her peaceful bosom 
frighting her pale-faced villages with war
and ostentation of despised arms 
comest thou because the anointed king is hence 
why foolish boy the king is left behind 
and in my loyal bosom lies his power 
were i but now the lord of such hot youth
as when brave gaunt thy father and myself
rescued the black prince that young mars of men 
from forth the ranks of many thousand french 
o then how quickly should this arm of mine 
now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee
and minister correction to thy fault 
my gracious uncle let me know my fault:
on what condition stands it and wherein 
even in condition of the worst degree 
in gross rebellion and detested treason:
thou art a banish d man and here art come
before the expiration of thy time 
in braving arms against thy sovereign 
as i was banish d i was banish d hereford 
but as i come i come for lancaster 
and noble uncle i beseech your grace
look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
you are my father for methinks in you
i see old gaunt alive o then my father 
will you permit that i shall stand condemn d
a wandering vagabond my rights and royalties
pluck d from my arms perforce and given away
to upstart unthrifts wherefore was i born 
if that my cousin king be king of england 
it must be granted i am duke of lancaster 
you have a son aumerle my noble cousin 
had you first died and he been thus trod down 
he should have found his uncle gaunt a father 
to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay 
i am denied to sue my livery here 
and yet my letters-patents give me leave:
my father s goods are all distrain d and sold 
and these and all are all amiss employ d 
what would you have me do i am a subject 
and i challenge law: attorneys are denied me 
and therefore personally i lay my claim
to my inheritance of free descent 
the noble duke hath been too much abused 
it stands your grace upon to do him right 
base men by his endowments are made great 
my lords of england let me tell you this:
i have had feeling of my cousin s wrongs
and laboured all i could to do him right 
but in this kind to come in braving arms 
be his own carver and cut out his way 
to find out right with wrong it may not be 
and you that do abet him in this kind
cherish rebellion and are rebels all 
the noble duke hath sworn his coming is
but for his own and for the right of that
we all have strongly sworn to give him aid 
and let him ne er see joy that breaks that oath 
well well i see the issue of these arms:
i cannot mend it i must needs confess 
because my power is weak and all ill left:
but if i could by him that gave me life 
i would attach you all and make you stoop
unto the sovereign mercy of the king 
but since i cannot be it known to you
i do remain as neuter so fare you well 
unless you please to enter in the castle
and there repose you for this night 
an offer uncle that we will accept:
but we must win your grace to go with us
to bristol castle which they say is held
by bushy bagot and their complices 
the caterpillars of the commonwealth 
which i have sworn to weed and pluck away 
it may be i will go with you: but yet i ll pause 
for i am loath to break our country s laws 
nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are:
things past redress are now with me past care 
captain
my lord of salisbury we have stay d ten days 
and hardly kept our countrymen together 
and yet we hear no tidings from the king 
therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell 
stay yet another day thou trusty welshman:
the king reposeth all his confidence in thee 
captain
tis thought the king is dead we will not stay 
the bay-trees in our country are all wither d
and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven 
the pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth
and lean-look d prophets whisper fearful change 
rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap 
the one in fear to lose what they enjoy 
the other to enjoy by rage and war:
these signs forerun the death or fall of kings 
farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled 
as well assured richard their king is dead 
ah richard with the eyes of heavy mind
i see thy glory like a shooting star
fall to the base earth from the firmament 
thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west 
witnessing storms to come woe and unrest:
thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes 
and crossly to thy good all fortune goes 
bring forth these men 
bushy and green i will not vex your souls 
since presently your souls must part your bodies 
with too much urging your pernicious lives 
for twere no charity yet to wash your blood
from off my hands here in the view of men
i will unfold some causes of your deaths 
you have misled a prince a royal king 
a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments 
by you unhappied and disfigured clean:
you have in manner with your sinful hours
made a divorce betwixt his queen and him 
broke the possession of a royal bed
and stain d the beauty of a fair queen s cheeks
with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs 
myself a prince by fortune of my birth 
near to the king in blood and near in love
till you did make him misinterpret me 
have stoop d my neck under your injuries 
and sigh d my english breath in foreign clouds 
eating the bitter bread of banishment 
whilst you have fed upon my signories 
dispark d my parks and fell d my forest woods 
from my own windows torn my household coat 
razed out my imprese leaving me no sign 
save men s opinions and my living blood 
to show the world i am a gentleman 
this and much more much more than twice all this 
condemns you to the death see them deliver d over
to execution and the hand of death 
more welcome is the stroke of death to me
than bolingbroke to england lords farewell 
my comfort is that heaven will take our souls
and plague injustice with the pains of hell 
my lord northumberland see them dispatch d 
uncle you say the queen is at your house 
for god s sake fairly let her be entreated:
tell her i send to her my kind commends 
take special care my greetings be deliver d 
a gentleman of mine i have dispatch d
with letters of your love to her at large 
thank gentle uncle come lords away 
to fight with glendower and his complices:
awhile to work and after holiday 
barkloughly castle call they this at hand 
yea my lord how brooks your grace the air 
after your late tossing on the breaking seas 
needs must i like it well: i weep for joy
to stand upon my kingdom once again 
dear earth i do salute thee with my hand 
though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs:
as a long-parted mother with her child
plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting 
so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth 
and do thee favours with my royal hands 
feed not thy sovereign s foe my gentle earth 
nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense 
but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom 
and heavy-gaited toads lie in their way 
doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
which with usurping steps do trample thee:
yield stinging nettles to mine enemies 
and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower 
guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder
whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
throw death upon thy sovereign s enemies 
mock not my senseless conjuration lords:
this earth shall have a feeling and these stones
prove armed soldiers ere her native king
shall falter under foul rebellion s arms 
fear not my lord: that power that made you king
hath power to keep you king in spite of all 
the means that heaven yields must be embraced 
and not neglected else if heaven would 
and we will not heaven s offer we refuse 
the proffer d means of succor and redress 
he means my lord that we are too remiss 
whilst bolingbroke through our security 
grows strong and great in substance and in power 
discomfortable cousin know st thou not
that when the searching eye of heaven is hid 
behind the globe that lights the lower world 
then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
in murders and in outrage boldly here 
but when from under this terrestrial ball
he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
and darts his light through every guilty hole 
then murders treasons and detested sins 
the cloak of night being pluck d from off their backs 
stand bare and naked trembling at themselves 
so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke 
who all this while hath revell d in the night
whilst we were wandering with the antipodes 
shall see us rising in our throne the east 
his treasons will sit blushing in his face 
not able to endure the sight of day 
but self-affrighted tremble at his sin 
not all the water in the rough rude sea
can wash the balm off from an anointed king 
the breath of worldly men cannot depose
the deputy elected by the lord:
for every man that bolingbroke hath press d
to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown 
god for his richard hath in heavenly pay
a glorious angel: then if angels fight 
weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right 
welcome my lord how far off lies your power 
nor near nor farther off my gracious lord 
than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
and bids me speak of nothing but despair 
one day too late i fear me noble lord 
hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:
o call back yesterday bid time return 
and thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men 
to-day to-day unhappy day too late 
o erthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state:
for all the welshmen hearing thou wert dead 
are gone to bolingbroke dispersed and fled 
comfort my liege why looks your grace so pale 
but now the blood of twenty thousand men
did triumph in my face and they are fled 
and till so much blood thither come again 
have i not reason to look pale and dead 
all souls that will be safe fly from my side 
for time hath set a blot upon my pride 
comfort my liege remember who you are 
i had forgot myself am i not king 
awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest 
is not the king s name twenty thousand names 
arm arm my name a puny subject strikes
at thy great glory look not to the ground 
ye favourites of a king: are we not high 
high be our thoughts: i know my uncle york
hath power enough to serve our turn but who comes here 
sir stephen scroop
more health and happiness betide my liege
than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him 
mine ear is open and my heart prepared 
the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold 
say is my kingdom lost why twas my care
and what loss is it to be rid of care 
strives bolingbroke to be as great as we 
greater he shall not be if he serve god 
we ll serve him too and be his fellow so:
revolt our subjects that we cannot mend 
they break their faith to god as well as us:
cry woe destruction ruin and decay:
the worst is death and death will have his day 
sir stephen scroop
glad am i that your highness is so arm d
to bear the tidings of calamity 
like an unseasonable stormy day 
which makes the silver rivers drown their shores 
as if the world were all dissolved to tears 
so high above his limits swells the rage
of bolingbroke covering your fearful land
with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel 
white-beards have arm d their thin and hairless scalps
against thy majesty boys with women s voices 
strive to speak big and clap their female joints
in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
the very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
of double-fatal yew against thy state 
yea distaff-women manage rusty bills
against thy seat: both young and old rebel 
and all goes worse than i have power to tell 
too well too well thou tell st a tale so ill 
where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot 
what is become of bushy where is green 
that they have let the dangerous enemy
measure our confines with such peaceful steps 
if we prevail their heads shall pay for it:
i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke 
sir stephen scroop
peace have they made with him indeed my lord 
o villains vipers damn d without redemption 
dogs easily won to fawn on any man 
snakes in my heart-blood warm d that sting my heart 
three judases each one thrice worse than judas 
would they make peace terrible hell make war
upon their spotted souls for this offence 
sir stephen scroop
sweet love i see changing his property 
turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:
again uncurse their souls their peace is made
with heads and not with hands those whom you curse
have felt the worst of death s destroying wound
and lie full low graved in the hollow ground 
is bushy green and the earl of wiltshire dead 
sir stephen scroop
ay all of them at bristol lost their heads 
where is the duke my father with his power 
no matter where of comfort no man speak:
let s talk of graves of worms and epitaphs 
make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
write sorrow on the bosom of the earth 
let s choose executors and talk of wills:
and yet not so for what can we bequeath
save our deposed bodies to the ground 
our lands our lives and all are bolingbroke s 
and nothing can we call our own but death
and that small model of the barren earth
which serves as paste and cover to our bones 
for god s sake let us sit upon the ground
and tell sad stories of the death of kings 
how some have been deposed some slain in war 
some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed 
some poison d by their wives: some sleeping kill d 
all murder d: for within the hollow crown
that rounds the mortal temples of a king
keeps death his court and there the antic sits 
scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp 
allowing him a breath a little scene 
to monarchize be fear d and kill with looks 
infusing him with self and vain conceit 
as if this flesh which walls about our life 
were brass impregnable and humour d thus
comes at the last and with a little pin
bores through his castle wall and farewell king 
cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
with solemn reverence: throw away respect 
tradition form and ceremonious duty 
for you have but mistook me all this while:
i live with bread like you feel want 
taste grief need friends: subjected thus 
how can you say to me i am a king 
my lord wise men ne er sit and wail their woes 
but presently prevent the ways to wail 
to fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength 
gives in your weakness strength unto your foe 
and so your follies fight against yourself 
fear and be slain no worse can come to fight:
and fight and die is death destroying death 
where fearing dying pays death servile breath 
my father hath a power inquire of him
and learn to make a body of a limb 
thou chidest me well: proud bolingbroke i come
to change blows with thee for our day of doom 
this ague fit of fear is over-blown 
an easy task it is to win our own 
say scroop where lies our uncle with his power 
speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour 
sir stephen scroop
men judge by the complexion of the sky
the state and inclination of the day:
so may you by my dull and heavy eye 
my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say 
i play the torturer by small and small
to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
your uncle york is join d with bolingbroke 
and all your northern castles yielded up 
and all your southern gentlemen in arms
upon his party 
thou hast said enough 
beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth
of that sweet way i was in to despair 
what say you now what comfort have we now 
by heaven i ll hate him everlastingly
that bids me be of comfort any more 
go to flint castle: there i ll pine away 
a king woe s slave shall kingly woe obey 
that power i have discharge and let them go
to ear the land that hath some hope to grow 
for i have none: let no man speak again
to alter this for counsel is but vain 
my liege one word 
he does me double wrong
that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue 
discharge my followers: let them hence away 
from richard s night to bolingbroke s fair day 
so that by this intelligence we learn
the welshmen are dispersed and salisbury
is gone to meet the king who lately landed
with some few private friends upon this coast 
the news is very fair and good my lord:
richard not far from hence hath hid his head 
it would beseem the lord northumberland
to say king richard: alack the heavy day
when such a sacred king should hide his head 
your grace mistakes only to be brief
left i his title out 
the time hath been 
would you have been so brief with him he would
have been so brief with you to shorten you 
for taking so the head your whole head s length 
mistake not uncle further than you should 
take not good cousin further than you should 
lest you mistake the heavens are o er our heads 
i know it uncle and oppose not myself
against their will but who comes here 
welcome harry: what will not this castle yield 
the castle royally is mann d my lord 
against thy entrance 
royally 
why it contains no king 
yes my good lord 
it doth contain a king king richard lies
within the limits of yon lime and stone:
and with him are the lord aumerle lord salisbury 
sir stephen scroop besides a clergyman
of holy reverence who i cannot learn 
o belike it is the bishop of carlisle 
noble lords 
go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle 
through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
into his ruin d ears and thus deliver:
henry bolingbroke
on both his knees doth kiss king richard s hand
and sends allegiance and true faith of heart
to his most royal person hither come
even at his feet to lay my arms and power 
provided that my banishment repeal d
and lands restored again be freely granted:
if not i ll use the advantage of my power
and lay the summer s dust with showers of blood
rain d from the wounds of slaughter d englishmen:
the which how far off from the mind of bolingbroke
it is such crimson tempest should bedrench
the fresh green lap of fair king richard s land 
my stooping duty tenderly shall show 
go signify as much while here we march
upon the grassy carpet of this plain 
let s march without the noise of threatening drum 
that from this castle s tatter d battlements
our fair appointments may be well perused 
methinks king richard and myself should meet
with no less terror than the elements
of fire and water when their thundering shock
at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven 
be he the fire i ll be the yielding water:
the rage be his whilst on the earth i rain
my waters on the earth and not on him 
march on and mark king richard how he looks 
see see king richard doth himself appear 
as doth the blushing discontented sun
from out the fiery portal of the east 
when he perceives the envious clouds are bent
to dim his glory and to stain the track
of his bright passage to the occident 
yet looks he like a king: behold his eye 
as bright as is the eagle s lightens forth
controlling majesty: alack alack for woe 
that any harm should stain so fair a show 
we are amazed and thus long have we stood
to watch the fearful bending of thy knee 
because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
and if we be how dare thy joints forget
to pay their awful duty to our presence 
if we be not show us the hand of god
that hath dismissed us from our stewardship 
for well we know no hand of blood and bone
can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre 
unless he do profane steal or usurp 
and though you think that all as you have done 
have torn their souls by turning them from us 
and we are barren and bereft of friends 
yet know my master god omnipotent 
is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
armies of pestilence and they shall strike
your children yet unborn and unbegot 
that lift your vassal hands against my head
and threat the glory of my precious crown 
tell bolingbroke for yond methinks he stands 
that every stride he makes upon my land
is dangerous treason: he is come to open
the purple testament of bleeding war 
but ere the crown he looks for live in peace 
ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers sons
shall ill become the flower of england s face 
change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
to scarlet indignation and bedew
her pastures grass with faithful english blood 
the king of heaven forbid our lord the king
should so with civil and uncivil arms
be rush d upon thy thrice noble cousin
harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand 
and by the honourable tomb he swears 
that stands upon your royal grandsire s bones 
and by the royalties of both your bloods 
currents that spring from one most gracious head 
and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt 
and by the worth and honour of himself 
comprising all that may be sworn or said 
his coming hither hath no further scope
than for his lineal royalties and to beg
enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees:
which on thy royal party granted once 
his glittering arms he will commend to rust 
his barbed steeds to stables and his heart
to faithful service of your majesty 
this swears he as he is a prince is just 
and as i am a gentleman i credit him 
northumberland say thus the king returns:
his noble cousin is right welcome hither 
and all the number of his fair demands
shall be accomplish d without contradiction:
with all the gracious utterance thou hast
speak to his gentle hearing kind commends 
we do debase ourselves cousin do we not 
to look so poorly and to speak so fair 
shall we call back northumberland and send
defiance to the traitor and so die 
no good my lord let s fight with gentle words
till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords 
o god o god that e er this tongue of mine 
that laid the sentence of dread banishment
on yon proud man should take it off again
with words of sooth o that i were as great
as is my grief or lesser than my name 
or that i could forget what i have been 
or not remember what i must be now 
swell st thou proud heart i ll give thee scope to beat 
since foes have scope to beat both thee and me 
northumberland comes back from bolingbroke 
what must the king do now must he submit 
the king shall do it: must he be deposed 
the king shall be contented: must he lose
the name of king o god s name let it go:
i ll give my jewels for a set of beads 
my gorgeous palace for a hermitage 
my gay apparel for an almsman s gown 
my figured goblets for a dish of wood 
my sceptre for a palmer s walking staff 
my subjects for a pair of carved saints
and my large kingdom for a little grave 
a little little grave an obscure grave 
or i ll be buried in the king s highway 
some way of common trade where subjects feet
may hourly trample on their sovereign s head 
for on my heart they tread now whilst i live 
and buried once why not upon my head 
aumerle thou weep st my tender-hearted cousin 
we ll make foul weather with despised tears 
our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn 
and make a dearth in this revolting land 
or shall we play the wantons with our woes 
and make some pretty match with shedding tears 
as thus to drop them still upon one place 
till they have fretted us a pair of graves
within the earth and therein laid there lies
two kinsmen digg d their graves with weeping eyes 
would not this ill do well well well i see
i talk but idly and you laugh at me 
most mighty prince my lord northumberland 
what says king bolingbroke will his majesty
give richard leave to live till richard die 
you make a leg and bolingbroke says ay 
my lord in the base court he doth attend
to speak with you may it please you to come down 
down down i come like glistering phaethon 
wanting the manage of unruly jades 
in the base court base court where kings grow base 
to come at traitors calls and do them grace 
in the base court come down down court 
down king 
for night-owls shriek where mounting larks
should sing 
what says his majesty 
sorrow and grief of heart
makes him speak fondly like a frantic man
yet he is come 
stand all apart 
and show fair duty to his majesty 
my gracious lord 
fair cousin you debase your princely knee
to make the base earth proud with kissing it:
me rather had my heart might feel your love
than my unpleased eye see your courtesy 
up cousin up your heart is up i know 
thus high at least although your knee be low 
my gracious lord i come but for mine own 
your own is yours and i am yours and all 
so far be mine my most redoubted lord 
as my true service shall deserve your love 
well you deserve: they well deserve to have 
that know the strong st and surest way to get 
uncle give me your hands: nay dry your eyes 
tears show their love but want their remedies 
cousin i am too young to be your father 
though you are old enough to be my heir 
what you will have i ll give and willing too 
for do we must what force will have us do 
set on towards london cousin is it so 
yea my good lord 
then i must not say no 
call forth bagot 
now bagot freely speak thy mind 
what thou dost know of noble gloucester s death 
who wrought it with the king and who perform d
the bloody office of his timeless end 
then set before my face the lord aumerle 
cousin stand forth and look upon that man 
my lord aumerle i know your daring tongue
scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver d 
in that dead time when gloucester s death was plotted 
i heard you say is not my arm of length 
that reacheth from the restful english court
as far as calais to mine uncle s head 
amongst much other talk that very time 
i heard you say that you had rather refuse
the offer of an hundred thousand crowns
than bolingbroke s return to england 
adding withal how blest this land would be
in this your cousin s death 
princes and noble lords 
what answer shall i make to this base man 
shall i so much dishonour my fair stars 
on equal terms to give him chastisement 
either i must or have mine honour soil d
with the attainder of his slanderous lips 
there is my gage the manual seal of death 
that marks thee out for hell: i say thou liest 
and will maintain what thou hast said is false
in thy heart-blood though being all too base
to stain the temper of my knightly sword 
bagot forbear thou shalt not take it up 
excepting one i would he were the best
in all this presence that hath moved me so 
if that thy valour stand on sympathy 
there is my gage aumerle in gage to thine:
by that fair sun which shows me where thou stand st 
i heard thee say and vauntingly thou spakest it
that thou wert cause of noble gloucester s death 
if thou deny st it twenty times thou liest 
and i will turn thy falsehood to thy heart 
where it was forged with my rapier s point 
thou darest not coward live to see that day 
now by my soul i would it were this hour 
fitzwater thou art damn d to hell for this 
aumerle thou liest his honour is as true
in this appeal as thou art all unjust 
and that thou art so there i throw my gage 
to prove it on thee to the extremest point
of mortal breathing: seize it if thou darest 
an if i do not may my hands rot off
and never brandish more revengeful steel
over the glittering helmet of my foe 
lord
i task the earth to the like forsworn aumerle 
and spur thee on with full as many lies
as may be holloa d in thy treacherous ear
from sun to sun: there is my honour s pawn 
engage it to the trial if thou darest 
who sets me else by heaven i ll throw at all:
i have a thousand spirits in one breast 
to answer twenty thousand such as you 
duke of surrey
my lord fitzwater i do remember well
the very time aumerle and you did talk 
tis very true: you were in presence then 
and you can witness with me this is true 
duke of surrey
as false by heaven as heaven itself is true 
surrey thou liest 
duke of surrey
dishonourable boy 
that lie shall lie so heavy on my sword 
that it shall render vengeance and revenge
till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
in earth as quiet as thy father s skull:
in proof whereof there is my honour s pawn 
engage it to the trial if thou darest 
how fondly dost thou spur a forward horse 
if i dare eat or drink or breathe or live 
i dare meet surrey in a wilderness 
and spit upon him whilst i say he lies 
and lies and lies: there is my bond of faith 
to tie thee to my strong correction 
as i intend to thrive in this new world 
aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
besides i heard the banish d norfolk say
that thou aumerle didst send two of thy men
to execute the noble duke at calais 
some honest christian trust me with a gage
that norfolk lies: here do i throw down this 
if he may be repeal d to try his honour 
these differences shall all rest under gage
till norfolk be repeal d: repeal d he shall be 
and though mine enemy restored again
to all his lands and signories: when he s return d 
against aumerle we will enforce his trial 
that honourable day shall ne er be seen 
many a time hath banish d norfolk fought
for jesu christ in glorious christian field 
streaming the ensign of the christian cross
against black pagans turks and saracens:
and toil d with works of war retired himself
to italy and there at venice gave
his body to that pleasant country s earth 
and his pure soul unto his captain christ 
under whose colours he had fought so long 
why bishop is norfolk dead 
as surely as i live my lord 
sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
of good old abraham lords appellants 
your differences shall all rest under gage
till we assign you to your days of trial 
great duke of lancaster i come to thee
from plume-pluck d richard who with willing soul
adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields
to the possession of thy royal hand:
ascend his throne descending now from him 
and long live henry fourth of that name 
in god s name i ll ascend the regal throne 
marry god forbid 
worst in this royal presence may i speak 
yet best beseeming me to speak the truth 
would god that any in this noble presence
were enough noble to be upright judge
of noble richard then true noblesse would
learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong 
what subject can give sentence on his king 
and who sits here that is not richard s subject 
thieves are not judged but they are by to hear 
although apparent guilt be seen in them 
and shall the figure of god s majesty 
his captain steward deputy-elect 
anointed crowned planted many years 
be judged by subject and inferior breath 
and he himself not present o forfend it god 
that in a christian climate souls refined
should show so heinous black obscene a deed 
i speak to subjects and a subject speaks 
stirr d up by god thus boldly for his king:
my lord of hereford here whom you call king 
is a foul traitor to proud hereford s king:
and if you crown him let me prophesy:
the blood of english shall manure the ground 
and future ages groan for this foul act 
peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels 
and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound 
disorder horror fear and mutiny
shall here inhabit and this land be call d
the field of golgotha and dead men s skulls 
o if you raise this house against this house 
it will the woefullest division prove
that ever fell upon this cursed earth 
prevent it resist it let it not be so 
lest child child s children cry against you woe 
well have you argued sir and for your pains 
of capital treason we arrest you here 
my lord of westminster be it your charge
to keep him safely till his day of trial 
may it please you lords to grant the commons suit 
fetch hither richard that in common view
he may surrender so we shall proceed
without suspicion 
i will be his conduct 
lords you that here are under our arrest 
procure your sureties for your days of answer 
little are we beholding to your love 
and little look d for at your helping hands 
alack why am i sent for to a king 
before i have shook off the regal thoughts
wherewith i reign d i hardly yet have learn d
to insinuate flatter bow and bend my limbs:
give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
to this submission yet i well remember
the favours of these men: were they not mine 
did they not sometime cry all hail to me 
so judas did to christ: but he in twelve 
found truth in all but one: i in twelve thousand none 
god save the king will no man say amen 
am i both priest and clerk well then amen 
god save the king although i be not he 
and yet amen if heaven do think him me 
to do what service am i sent for hither 
to do that office of thine own good will
which tired majesty did make thee offer 
the resignation of thy state and crown
to henry bolingbroke 
give me the crown here cousin seize the crown 
here cousin:
on this side my hand and on that side yours 
now is this golden crown like a deep well
that owes two buckets filling one another 
the emptier ever dancing in the air 
the other down unseen and full of water:
that bucket down and full of tears am i 
drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high 
i thought you had been willing to resign 
my crown i am but still my griefs are mine:
you may my glories and my state depose 
but not my griefs still am i king of those 
part of your cares you give me with your crown 
your cares set up do not pluck my cares down 
my care is loss of care by old care done 
your care is gain of care by new care won:
the cares i give i have though given away 
they tend the crown yet still with me they stay 
are you contented to resign the crown 
ay no no ay for i must nothing be 
therefore no no for i resign to thee 
now mark me how i will undo myself 
i give this heavy weight from off my head
and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand 
the pride of kingly sway from out my heart 
with mine own tears i wash away my balm 
with mine own hands i give away my crown 
with mine own tongue deny my sacred state 
with mine own breath release all duty s rites:
all pomp and majesty i do forswear 
my manors rents revenues i forego 
my acts decrees and statutes i deny:
god pardon all oaths that are broke to me 
god keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee 
make me that nothing have with nothing grieved 
and thou with all pleased that hast all achieved 
long mayst thou live in richard s seat to sit 
and soon lie richard in an earthly pit 
god save king harry unking d richard says 
and send him many years of sunshine days 
what more remains 
no more but that you read
these accusations and these grievous crimes
committed by your person and your followers
against the state and profit of this land 
that by confessing them the souls of men
may deem that you are worthily deposed 
must i do so and must i ravel out
my weaved-up folly gentle northumberland 
if thy offences were upon record 
would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
to read a lecture of them if thou wouldst 
there shouldst thou find one heinous article 
containing the deposing of a king
and cracking the strong warrant of an oath 
mark d with a blot damn d in the book of heaven:
nay all of you that stand and look upon 
whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself 
though some of you with pilate wash your hands
showing an outward pity yet you pilates
have here deliver d me to my sour cross 
and water cannot wash away your sin 
my lord dispatch read o er these articles 
mine eyes are full of tears i cannot see:
and yet salt water blinds them not so much
but they can see a sort of traitors here 
nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself 
i find myself a traitor with the rest 
for i have given here my soul s consent
to undeck the pompous body of a king 
made glory base and sovereignty a slave 
proud majesty a subject state a peasant 
my lord 
no lord of thine thou haught insulting man 
nor no man s lord i have no name no title 
no not that name was given me at the font 
but tis usurp d: alack the heavy day 
that i have worn so many winters out 
and know not now what name to call myself 
o that i were a mockery king of snow 
standing before the sun of bolingbroke 
to melt myself away in water-drops 
good king great king and yet not greatly good 
an if my word be sterling yet in england 
let it command a mirror hither straight 
that it may show me what a face i have 
since it is bankrupt of his majesty 
go some of you and fetch a looking-glass 
read o er this paper while the glass doth come 
fiend thou torment st me ere i come to hell 
urge it no more my lord northumberland 
the commons will not then be satisfied 
they shall be satisfied: i ll read enough 
when i do see the very book indeed
where all my sins are writ and that s myself 
give me the glass and therein will i read 
no deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck
so many blows upon this face of mine 
and made no deeper wounds o flattering glass 
like to my followers in prosperity 
thou dost beguile me was this face the face
that every day under his household roof
did keep ten thousand men was this the face
that like the sun did make beholders wink 
was this the face that faced so many follies 
and was at last out-faced by bolingbroke 
a brittle glory shineth in this face:
as brittle as the glory is the face 
for there it is crack d in a hundred shivers 
mark silent king the moral of this sport 
how soon my sorrow hath destroy d my face 
the shadow of your sorrow hath destroy d
the shadow or your face 
say that again 
the shadow of my sorrow ha let s see:
tis very true my grief lies all within 
and these external manners of laments
are merely shadows to the unseen grief
that swells with silence in the tortured soul 
there lies the substance: and i thank thee king 
for thy great bounty that not only givest
me cause to wail but teachest me the way
how to lament the cause i ll beg one boon 
and then be gone and trouble you no more 
shall i obtain it 
name it fair cousin 
fair cousin i am greater than a king:
for when i was a king my flatterers
were then but subjects being now a subject 
i have a king here to my flatterer 
being so great i have no need to beg 
yet ask 
and shall i have 
you shall 
then give me leave to go 
whither 
whither you will so i were from your sights 
go some of you convey him to the tower 
o good convey conveyers are you all 
that rise thus nimbly by a true king s fall 
on wednesday next we solemnly set down
our coronation: lords prepare yourselves 
a woeful pageant have we here beheld 
the woe s to come the children yet unborn 
shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn 
you holy clergymen is there no plot
to rid the realm of this pernicious blot 
my lord 
before i freely speak my mind herein 
you shall not only take the sacrament
to bury mine intents but also to effect
whatever i shall happen to devise 
i see your brows are full of discontent 
your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
come home with me to supper and i ll lay
a plot shall show us all a merry day 
join not with grief fair woman do not so 
to make my end too sudden: learn good soul 
to think our former state a happy dream 
from which awaked the truth of what we are
shows us but this: i am sworn brother sweet 
to grim necessity and he and i
will keep a league till death hie thee to france
and cloister thee in some religious house:
our holy lives must win a new world s crown 
which our profane hours here have stricken down 
a king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts 
i had been still a happy king of men 
good sometime queen prepare thee hence for france:
think i am dead and that even here thou takest 
as from my death-bed thy last living leave 
in winter s tedious nights sit by the fire
with good old folks and let them tell thee tales
of woeful ages long ago betid 
and ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs 
tell thou the lamentable tale of me
and send the hearers weeping to their beds:
for why the senseless brands will sympathize
the heavy accent of thy moving tongue
and in compassion weep the fire out 
and some will mourn in ashes some coal-black 
for the deposing of a rightful king 
my lord the mind of bolingbroke is changed:
you must to pomfret not unto the tower 
and madam there is order ta en for you 
with all swift speed you must away to france 
northumberland thou ladder wherewithal
the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne 
the time shall not be many hours of age
more than it is ere foul sin gathering head
shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think 
though he divide the realm and give thee half 
it is too little helping him to all 
and he shall think that thou which know st the way
to plant unrightful kings wilt know again 
being ne er so little urged another way
to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne 
the love of wicked men converts to fear 
that fear to hate and hate turns one or both
to worthy danger and deserved death 
my guilt be on my head and there an end 
take leave and part for you must part forthwith 
doubly divorced bad men you violate
a twofold marriage twixt my crown and me 
and then betwixt me and my married wife 
let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me 
and yet not so for with a kiss twas made 
part us northumberland i toward the north 
where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime 
my wife to france: from whence set forth in pomp 
she came adorned hither like sweet may 
sent back like hallowmas or short st of day 
ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart 
that were some love but little policy 
so two together weeping make one woe 
weep thou for me in france i for thee here 
better far off than near be ne er the near 
go count thy way with sighs i mine with groans 
twice for one step i ll groan the way being short 
and piece the way out with a heavy heart 
come come in wooing sorrow let s be brief 
since wedding it there is such length in grief 
one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part 
thus give i mine and thus take i thy heart 
we make woe wanton with this fond delay:
once more adieu the rest let sorrow say 
where did i leave 
then as i said the duke great bolingbroke 
mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
which his aspiring rider seem d to know 
with slow but stately pace kept on his course 
whilst all tongues cried god save thee 
bolingbroke 
you would have thought the very windows spake 
so many greedy looks of young and old
through casements darted their desiring eyes
upon his visage and that all the walls
with painted imagery had said at once
jesu preserve thee welcome bolingbroke 
whilst he from the one side to the other turning 
bareheaded lower than his proud steed s neck 
bespake them thus: i thank you countrymen: 
and thus still doing thus he pass d along 
as in a theatre the eyes of men 
after a well-graced actor leaves the stage 
are idly bent on him that enters next 
thinking his prattle to be tedious 
even so or with much more contempt men s eyes
did scowl on gentle richard no man cried god save him 
no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
but dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
which with such gentle sorrow he shook off 
his face still combating with tears and smiles 
the badges of his grief and patience 
that had not god for some strong purpose steel d
the hearts of men they must perforce have melted
and barbarism itself have pitied him 
but heaven hath a hand in these events 
to whose high will we bound our calm contents 
to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now 
whose state and honour i for aye allow 
aumerle that was 
but that is lost for being richard s friend 
and madam you must call him rutland now:
i am in parliament pledge for his truth
and lasting fealty to the new-made king 
madam i know not nor i greatly care not:
god knows i had as lief be none as one 
well bear you well in this new spring of time 
lest you be cropp d before you come to prime 
what news from oxford hold those justs and triumphs 
for aught i know my lord they do 
you will be there i know 
if god prevent not i purpose so 
what seal is that that hangs without thy bosom 
yea look st thou pale let me see the writing 
my lord tis nothing 
no matter then who see it 
i will be satisfied let me see the writing 
i do beseech your grace to pardon me:
it is a matter of small consequence 
which for some reasons i would not have seen 
which for some reasons sir i mean to see 
i fear i fear 
bound to himself what doth he with a bond
that he is bound to wife thou art a fool 
boy let me see the writing 
i do beseech you pardon me i may not show it 
i will be satisfied let me see it i say 
treason foul treason villain traitor slave 
ho who is within there 
saddle my horse 
god for his mercy what treachery is here 
give me my boots i say saddle my horse 
now by mine honour by my life by my troth 
i will appeach the villain 
peace foolish woman 
good mother be content it is no more
than my poor life must answer 
bring me my boots: i will unto the king 
give me my boots i say 
thou fond mad woman 
wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy 
a dozen of them here have ta en the sacrament 
and interchangeably set down their hands 
to kill the king at oxford 
away fond woman were he twenty times my son 
i would appeach him 
make way unruly woman 
can no man tell me of my unthrifty son 
tis full three months since i did see him last 
if any plague hang over us tis he 
i would to god my lords he might be found:
inquire at london mongst the taverns there 
for there they say he daily doth frequent 
with unrestrained loose companions 
even such they say as stand in narrow lanes 
and beat our watch and rob our passengers 
which he young wanton and effeminate boy 
takes on the point of honour to support
so dissolute a crew 
my lord some two days since i saw the prince 
and told him of those triumphs held at oxford 
and what said the gallant 
his answer was he would unto the stews 
and from the common st creature pluck a glove 
and wear it as a favour and with that
he would unhorse the lustiest challenger 
as dissolute as desperate yet through both
i see some sparks of better hope which elder years
may happily bring forth but who comes here 
where is the king 
what means our cousin that he stares and looks
so wildly 
god save your grace i do beseech your majesty 
to have some conference with your grace alone 
withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone 
what is the matter with our cousin now 
for ever may my knees grow to the earth 
my tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
unless a pardon ere i rise or speak 
intended or committed was this fault 
if on the first how heinous e er it be 
to win thy after-love i pardon thee 
then give me leave that i may turn the key 
that no man enter till my tale be done 
have thy desire 
[within] my liege beware look to thyself 
thou hast a traitor in thy presence there 
villain i ll make thee safe 
stay thy revengeful hand thou hast no cause to fear 
[within] open the door secure foolhardy king:
shall i for love speak treason to thy face 
open the door or i will break it open 
what is the matter uncle speak 
recover breath tell us how near is danger 
that we may arm us to encounter it 
peruse this writing here and thou shalt know
the treason that my haste forbids me show 
remember as thou read st thy promise pass d:
i do repent me read not my name there
my heart is not confederate with my hand 
it was villain ere thy hand did set it down 
i tore it from the traitor s bosom king 
fear and not love begets his penitence:
forget to pity him lest thy pity prove
a serpent that will sting thee to the heart 
o heinous strong and bold conspiracy 
o loyal father of a treacherous son 
thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain 
from when this stream through muddy passages
hath held his current and defiled himself 
thy overflow of good converts to bad 
and thy abundant goodness shall excuse
this deadly blot in thy digressing son 
so shall my virtue be his vice s bawd 
and he shall spend mine honour with his shame 
as thriftless sons their scraping fathers gold 
mine honour lives when his dishonour dies 
or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
thou kill st me in his life giving him breath 
the traitor lives the true man s put to death 
what shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry 
our scene is alter d from a serious thing 
and now changed to the beggar and the king 
my dangerous cousin let your mother in:
i know she is come to pray for your foul sin 
if thou do pardon whosoever pray 
more sins for this forgiveness prosper may 
this fester d joint cut off the rest rest sound 
this let alone will all the rest confound 
thou frantic woman what dost thou make here 
shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear 
rise up good aunt 
unto my mother s prayers i bend my knee 
against them both my true joints bended be 
ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace 
good aunt stand up 
speak it in french king say pardonne moi 
good aunt stand up 
i pardon him as god shall pardon me 
with all my heart
i pardon him 
but for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot 
with all the rest of that consorted crew 
destruction straight shall dog them at the heels 
good uncle help to order several powers
to oxford or where er these traitors are:
they shall not live within this world i swear 
but i will have them if i once know where 
uncle farewell: and cousin too adieu:
your mother well hath pray d and prove you true 
didst thou not mark the king what words he spake 
have i no friend will rid me of this living fear 
was it not so 
servant
these were his very words 
have i no friend quoth he: he spake it twice 
and urged it twice together did he not 
servant
he did 
and speaking it he wistly look d on me 
and who should say i would thou wert the man 
that would divorce this terror from my heart 
meaning the king at pomfret come let s go:
i am the king s friend and will rid his foe 
i have been studying how i may compare
this prison where i live unto the world:
and for because the world is populous
and here is not a creature but myself 
i cannot do it yet i ll hammer it out 
my brain i ll prove the female to my soul 
my soul the father and these two beget
a generation of still-breeding thoughts 
and these same thoughts people this little world 
in humours like the people of this world 
for no thought is contented the better sort 
as thoughts of things divine are intermix d
with scruples and do set the word itself
against the word:
as thus come little ones and then again 
it is as hard to come as for a camel
to thread the postern of a small needle s eye 
thoughts tending to ambition they do plot
unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails
may tear a passage through the flinty ribs
of this hard world my ragged prison walls 
and for they cannot die in their own pride 
thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
that they are not the first of fortune s slaves 
nor shall not be the last like silly beggars
who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame 
that many have and others must sit there 
and in this thought they find a kind of ease 
bearing their own misfortunes on the back
of such as have before endured the like 
thus play i in one person many people 
and none contented: sometimes am i king 
then treasons make me wish myself a beggar 
and so i am: then crushing penury
persuades me i was better when a king 
then am i king d again: and by and by
think that i am unking d by bolingbroke 
and straight am nothing: but whate er i be 
nor i nor any man that but man is
with nothing shall be pleased till he be eased
with being nothing music do i hear 
ha ha keep time: how sour sweet music is 
when time is broke and no proportion kept 
so is it in the music of men s lives 
and here have i the daintiness of ear
to cheque time broke in a disorder d string 
but for the concord of my state and time
had not an ear to hear my true time broke 
i wasted time and now doth time waste me 
for now hath time made me his numbering clock:
my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar
their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch 
whereto my finger like a dial s point 
is pointing still in cleansing them from tears 
now sir the sound that tells what hour it is
are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart 
which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
show minutes times and hours: but my time
runs posting on in bolingbroke s proud joy 
while i stand fooling here his jack o the clock 
this music mads me let it sound no more 
for though it have holp madmen to their wits 
in me it seems it will make wise men mad 
yet blessing on his heart that gives it me 
for tis a sign of love and love to richard
is a strange brooch in this all-hating world 
groom
hail royal prince 
thanks noble peer 
the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear 
what art thou and how comest thou hither 
where no man never comes but that sad dog
that brings me food to make misfortune live 
groom
i was a poor groom of thy stable king 
when thou wert king who travelling towards york 
with much ado at length have gotten leave
to look upon my sometimes royal master s face 
o how it yearn d my heart when i beheld
in london streets that coronation-day 
when bolingbroke rode on roan barbary 
that horse that thou so often hast bestrid 
that horse that i so carefully have dress d 
rode he on barbary tell me gentle friend 
how went he under him 
groom
so proudly as if he disdain d the ground 
so proud that bolingbroke was on his back 
that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand 
this hand hath made him proud with clapping him 
would he not stumble would he not fall down 
since pride must have a fall and break the neck
of that proud man that did usurp his back 
forgiveness horse why do i rail on thee 
since thou created to be awed by man 
wast born to bear i was not made a horse 
and yet i bear a burthen like an ass 
spurr d gall d and tired by jouncing bolingbroke 
keeper
fellow give place here is no longer stay 
if thou love me tis time thou wert away 
groom
what my tongue dares not that my heart shall say 
keeper
my lord will t please you to fall to 
taste of it first as thou art wont to do 
keeper
my lord i dare not: sir pierce of exton who
lately came from the king commands the contrary 
the devil take henry of lancaster and thee 
patience is stale and i am weary of it 
keeper
help help help 
how now what means death in this rude assault 
villain thy own hand yields thy death s instrument 
go thou and fill another room in hell 
that hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
that staggers thus my person exton thy fierce hand
hath with the king s blood stain d the king s own land 
mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high 
whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die 
as full of valour as of royal blood:
both have i spill d o would the deed were good 
for now the devil that told me i did well 
says that this deed is chronicled in hell 
this dead king to the living king i ll bear
take hence the rest and give them burial here 
kind uncle york the latest news we hear
is that the rebels have consumed with fire
our town of cicester in gloucestershire 
but whether they be ta en or slain we hear not 
welcome my lord what is the news 
first to thy sacred state wish i all happiness 
the next news is i have to london sent
the heads of oxford salisbury blunt and kent:
the manner of their taking may appear
at large discoursed in this paper here 
we thank thee gentle percy for thy pains 
and to thy worth will add right worthy gains 
my lord i have from oxford sent to london
the heads of brocas and sir bennet seely 
two of the dangerous consorted traitors
that sought at oxford thy dire overthrow 
thy pains fitzwater shall not be forgot 
right noble is thy merit well i wot 
the grand conspirator abbot of westminster 
with clog of conscience and sour melancholy
hath yielded up his body to the grave 
but here is carlisle living to abide
thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride 
carlisle this is your doom:
choose out some secret place some reverend room 
more than thou hast and with it joy thy life 
so as thou livest in peace die free from strife:
for though mine enemy thou hast ever been 
high sparks of honour in thee have i seen 
great king within this coffin i present
thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
the mightiest of thy greatest enemies 
richard of bordeaux by me hither brought 
exton i thank thee not for thou hast wrought
a deed of slander with thy fatal hand
upon my head and all this famous land 
from your own mouth my lord did i this deed 
they love not poison that do poison need 
nor do i thee: though i did wish him dead 
i hate the murderer love him murdered 
the guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour 
but neither my good word nor princely favour:
with cain go wander through shades of night 
and never show thy head by day nor light 
lords i protest my soul is full of woe 
that blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:
come mourn with me for that i do lament 
and put on sullen black incontinent:
i ll make a voyage to the holy land 
to wash this blood off from my guilty hand:
march sadly after grace my mournings here 
in weeping after this untimely bier 
gregory o my word we ll not carry coals 
no for then we should be colliers 
i mean an we be in choler we ll draw 
ay while you live draw your neck out o the collar 
i strike quickly being moved 
but thou art not quickly moved to strike 
a dog of the house of montague moves me 
to move is to stir and to be valiant is to stand:
therefore if thou art moved thou runn st away 
a dog of that house shall move me to stand: i will
take the wall of any man or maid of montague s 
that shows thee a weak slave for the weakest goes
to the wall 
true and therefore women being the weaker vessels 
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore i will push
montague s men from the wall and thrust his maids
to the wall 
the quarrel is between our masters and us their men 
tis all one i will show myself a tyrant: when i
have fought with the men i will be cruel with the
maids and cut off their heads 
the heads of the maids 
ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads 
take it in what sense thou wilt 
they must take it in sense that feel it 
me they shall feel while i am able to stand: and
tis known i am a pretty piece of flesh 
tis well thou art not fish if thou hadst thou
hadst been poor john draw thy tool here comes
two of the house of the montagues 
my naked weapon is out: quarrel i will back thee 
how turn thy back and run

let us take the law of our sides let them begin 
i will frown as i pass by and let them take it as
they list 
nay as they dare i will bite my thumb at them 
which is a disgrace to them if they bear it 
do you bite your thumb at us sir 
i do bite my thumb sir 
do you bite your thumb at us sir 
[aside to male] is the law of our side if i say
ay 
no 
no sir i do not bite my thumb at you sir but i
bite my thumb sir 
do you quarrel sir 
quarrel sir no sir 
if you do sir i am for you: i serve as good a man as you 
no better 
well sir 
say better: here comes one of my master s kinsmen 
yes better sir 
you lie 
draw if you be men gregory remember thy swashing blow 
part fools 
put up your swords you know not what you do 
what art thou drawn among these heartless hinds 
turn thee benvolio look upon thy death 
i do but keep the peace: put up thy sword 
or manage it to part these men with me 
what drawn and talk of peace i hate the word 
as i hate hell all montagues and thee:
have at thee coward 
first citizen
clubs bills and partisans strike beat them down 
down with the capulets down with the montagues 
what noise is this give me my long sword ho 
a crutch a crutch why call you for a sword 
my sword i say old montague is come 
and flourishes his blade in spite of me 
thou villain capulet hold me not let me go 
rebellious subjects enemies to peace 
profaners of this neighbour-stained steel 
will they not hear what ho you men you beasts 
that quench the fire of your pernicious rage
with purple fountains issuing from your veins 
on pain of torture from those bloody hands
throw your mistemper d weapons to the ground 
and hear the sentence of your moved prince 
three civil brawls bred of an airy word 
by thee old capulet and montague 
have thrice disturb d the quiet of our streets 
and made verona s ancient citizens
cast by their grave beseeming ornaments 
to wield old partisans in hands as old 
canker d with peace to part your canker d hate:
if ever you disturb our streets again 
your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace 
for this time all the rest depart away:
you capulet shall go along with me:
and montague come you this afternoon 
to know our further pleasure in this case 
to old free-town our common judgment-place 
once more on pain of death all men depart 
who set this ancient quarrel new abroach 
speak nephew were you by when it began 
here were the servants of your adversary 
and yours close fighting ere i did approach:
i drew to part them: in the instant came
the fiery tybalt with his sword prepared 
which as he breathed defiance to my ears 
he swung about his head and cut the winds 
who nothing hurt withal hiss d him in scorn:
while we were interchanging thrusts and blows 
came more and more and fought on part and part 
till the prince came who parted either part 
madam an hour before the worshipp d sun
peer d forth the golden window of the east 
a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad 
where underneath the grove of sycamore
that westward rooteth from the city s side 
so early walking did i see your son:
towards him i made but he was ware of me
and stole into the covert of the wood:
i measuring his affections by my own 
that most are busied when they re most alone 
pursued my humour not pursuing his 
and gladly shunn d who gladly fled from me 
many a morning hath he there been seen 
with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew 
adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs 
but all so soon as the all-cheering sun
should in the furthest east begin to draw
the shady curtains from aurora s bed 
away from the light steals home my heavy son 
and private in his chamber pens himself 
shuts up his windows locks far daylight out
and makes himself an artificial night:
black and portentous must this humour prove 
unless good counsel may the cause remove 
my noble uncle do you know the cause 
i neither know it nor can learn of him 
have you importuned him by any means 
both by myself and many other friends:
but he his own affections counsellor 
is to himself i will not say how true 
but to himself so secret and so close 
so far from sounding and discovery 
as is the bud bit with an envious worm 
ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air 
or dedicate his beauty to the sun 
could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow 
we would as willingly give cure as know 
see where he comes: so please you step aside 
i ll know his grievance or be much denied 
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay 
to hear true shrift come madam let s away 
good-morrow cousin 
is the day so young 
but new struck nine 
ay me sad hours seem long 
was that my father that went hence so fast 
it was what sadness lengthens romeo s hours 
not having that which having makes them short 
in love 
out 
of love 
out of her favour where i am in love 
alas that love so gentle in his view 
should be so tyrannous and rough in proof 
alas that love whose view is muffled still 
should without eyes see pathways to his will 
where shall we dine o me what fray was here 
yet tell me not for i have heard it all 
here s much to do with hate but more with love 
why then o brawling love o loving hate 
o any thing of nothing first create 
o heavy lightness serious vanity 
mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms 
feather of lead bright smoke cold fire 
sick health 
still-waking sleep that is not what it is 
this love feel i that feel no love in this 
dost thou not laugh 
no coz i rather weep 
good heart at what 
at thy good heart s oppression 
why such is love s transgression 
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast 
which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
with more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
doth add more grief to too much of mine own 
love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs 
being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes 
being vex d a sea nourish d with lovers tears:
what is it else a madness most discreet 
a choking gall and a preserving sweet 
farewell my coz 
soft i will go along 
an if you leave me so you do me wrong 
tut i have lost myself i am not here 
this is not romeo he s some other where 
tell me in sadness who is that you love 
what shall i groan and tell thee 
groan why no 
but sadly tell me who 
bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
ah word ill urged to one that is so ill 
in sadness cousin i do love a woman 
i aim d so near when i supposed you loved 
a right good mark-man and she s fair i love 
a right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit 
well in that hit you miss: she ll not be hit
with cupid s arrow she hath dian s wit 
and in strong proof of chastity well arm d 
from love s weak childish bow she lives unharm d 
she will not stay the siege of loving terms 
nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes 
nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
o she is rich in beauty only poor 
that when she dies with beauty dies her store 
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste 
she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste 
for beauty starved with her severity
cuts beauty off from all posterity 
she is too fair too wise wisely too fair 
to merit bliss by making me despair:
she hath forsworn to love and in that vow
do i live dead that live to tell it now 
be ruled by me forget to think of her 
o teach me how i should forget to think 
by giving liberty unto thine eyes 
examine other beauties 
tis the way
to call hers exquisite in question more:
these happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows
being black put us in mind they hide the fair 
he that is strucken blind cannot forget
the precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
show me a mistress that is passing fair 
what doth her beauty serve but as a note
where i may read who pass d that passing fair 
farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget 
i ll pay that doctrine or else die in debt 
but montague is bound as well as i 
in penalty alike and tis not hard i think 
for men so old as we to keep the peace 
of honourable reckoning are you both 
and pity tis you lived at odds so long 
but now my lord what say you to my suit 
but saying o er what i have said before:
my child is yet a stranger in the world 
she hath not seen the change of fourteen years 
let two more summers wither in their pride 
ere we may think her ripe to be a bride 
younger than she are happy mothers made 
and too soon marr d are those so early made 
the earth hath swallow d all my hopes but she 
she is the hopeful lady of my earth:
but woo her gentle paris get her heart 
my will to her consent is but a part 
an she agree within her scope of choice
lies my consent and fair according voice 
this night i hold an old accustom d feast 
whereto i have invited many a guest 
such as i love and you among the store 
one more most welcome makes my number more 
at my poor house look to behold this night
earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
such comfort as do lusty young men feel
when well-apparell d april on the heel
of limping winter treads even such delight
among fresh female buds shall you this night
inherit at my house hear all all see 
and like her most whose merit most shall be:
which on more view of many mine being one
may stand in number though in reckoning none 
come go with me 
go sirrah trudge about
through fair verona find those persons out
whose names are written there and to them say 
my house and welcome on their pleasure stay 
find them out whose names are written here it is
written that the shoemaker should meddle with his
yard and the tailor with his last the fisher with
his pencil and the painter with his nets but i am
sent to find those persons whose names are here
writ and can never find what names the writing
person hath here writ i must to the learned in good time 
tut man one fire burns out another s burning 
one pain is lessen d by another s anguish 
turn giddy and be holp by backward turning 
one desperate grief cures with another s languish:
take thou some new infection to thy eye 
and the rank poison of the old will die 
your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that 
for what i pray thee 
for your broken shin 
why romeo art thou mad 
not mad but bound more than a mad-man is 
shut up in prison kept without my food 
whipp d and tormented and god-den good fellow 
god gi god-den i pray sir can you read

perhaps you have learned it without book: but i
pray can you read any thing you see

nieces mercutio and his brother valentine mine
uncle capulet his wife and daughters my fair niece
rosaline livia signior valentio and his cousin
tybalt lucio and the lively helena a fair
assembly: whither should they come 
up 
whither 
to supper to our house 
whose house 
my master s 
indeed i should have ask d you that before 
now i ll tell you without asking: my master is the
great rich capulet and if you be not of the house
of montagues i pray come and crush a cup of wine 
rest you merry 
at this same ancient feast of capulet s
sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lovest 
with all the admired beauties of verona:
go thither and with unattainted eye 
compare her face with some that i shall show 
and i will make thee think thy swan a crow 
when the devout religion of mine eye
maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires 
and these who often drown d could never die 
transparent heretics be burnt for liars 
one fairer than my love the all-seeing sun
ne er saw her match since first the world begun 
tut you saw her fair none else being by 
herself poised with herself in either eye:
but in that crystal scales let there be weigh d
your lady s love against some other maid
that i will show you shining at this feast 
and she shall scant show well that now shows best 
i ll go along no such sight to be shown 
but to rejoice in splendor of mine own 
nurse where s my daughter call her forth to me 
now by my maidenhead at twelve year old 
i bade her come what lamb what ladybird 
god forbid where s this girl what juliet 
how now who calls 
your mother 
madam i am here 
what is your will 
this is the matter:—nurse give leave awhile 
we must talk in secret:—nurse come back again 
i have remember d me thou s hear our counsel 
thou know st my daughter s of a pretty age 
faith i can tell her age unto an hour 
she s not fourteen 
i ll lay fourteen of my teeth 
and yet to my teeth be it spoken i have but four 
she is not fourteen how long is it now
to lammas-tide 
a fortnight and odd days 
even or odd of all days in the year 
come lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen 
susan and she god rest all christian souls 
were of an age: well susan is with god 
she was too good for me: but as i said 
on lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen 
that shall she marry i remember it well 
tis since the earthquake now eleven years 
and she was wean d i never shall forget it 
of all the days of the year upon that day:
for i had then laid wormwood to my dug 
sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall 
my lord and you were then at mantua: 
nay i do bear a brain: but as i said 
when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool 
to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug 
shake quoth the dove-house: twas no need i trow 
to bid me trudge:
and since that time it is eleven years 
for then she could stand alone nay by the rood 
she could have run and waddled all about 
for even the day before she broke her brow:
and then my husband god be with his soul 
a was a merry man took up the child:
yea quoth he dost thou fall upon thy face 
thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit 
wilt thou not jule and by my holidame 
the pretty wretch left crying and said ay 
to see now how a jest shall come about 
i warrant an i should live a thousand years 
i never should forget it: wilt thou not jule quoth he 
and pretty fool it stinted and said ay 
enough of this i pray thee hold thy peace 
yes madam: yet i cannot choose but laugh 
to think it should leave crying and say ay 
and yet i warrant it had upon its brow
a bump as big as a young cockerel s stone 
a parlous knock and it cried bitterly:
yea quoth my husband fall st upon thy face 
thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age 
wilt thou not jule it stinted and said ay 
and stint thou too i pray thee nures say i 
peace i have done god mark thee to his grace 
thou wast the prettiest babe that e er i nurse:
an i might live to see thee married once 
i have my wish 
marry that marry is the very theme
i came to talk of tell me daughter juliet 
how stands your disposition to be married 
it is an honour that i dream not of 
an honour were not i thine only nurse 
i would say thou hadst suck d wisdom from thy teat 
well think of marriage now younger than you 
here in verona ladies of esteem 
are made already mothers: by my count 
i was your mother much upon these years
that you are now a maid thus then in brief:
the valiant paris seeks you for his love 
a man young lady lady such a man
as all the world why he s a man of wax 
verona s summer hath not such a flower 
nay he s a flower in faith a very flower 
what say you can you love the gentleman 
this night you shall behold him at our feast 
read o er the volume of young paris face 
and find delight writ there with beauty s pen 
examine every married lineament 
and see how one another lends content
and what obscured in this fair volume lies
find written in the margent of his eyes 
this precious book of love this unbound lover 
to beautify him only lacks a cover:
the fish lives in the sea and tis much pride
for fair without the fair within to hide:
that book in many s eyes doth share the glory 
that in gold clasps locks in the golden story 
so shall you share all that he doth possess 
by having him making yourself no less 
no less nay bigger women grow by men 
speak briefly can you like of paris love 
i ll look to like if looking liking move:
but no more deep will i endart mine eye
than your consent gives strength to make it fly 
madam the guests are come supper served up you
called my young lady asked for the nurse cursed in
the pantry and every thing in extremity i must
hence to wait i beseech you follow straight 
we follow thee 
juliet the county stays 
go girl seek happy nights to happy days 
what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse 
or shall we on without a apology 
the date is out of such prolixity:
we ll have no cupid hoodwink d with a scarf 
bearing a tartar s painted bow of lath 
scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper 
nor no without-book prologue faintly spoke
after the prompter for our entrance:
but let them measure us by what they will 
we ll measure them a measure and be gone 
give me a torch: i am not for this ambling 
being but heavy i will bear the light 
nay gentle romeo we must have you dance 
not i believe me: you have dancing shoes
with nimble soles: i have a soul of lead
so stakes me to the ground i cannot move 
you are a lover borrow cupid s wings 
and soar with them above a common bound 
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft
to soar with his light feathers and so bound 
i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
under love s heavy burden do i sink 
and to sink in it should you burden love 
too great oppression for a tender thing 
is love a tender thing it is too rough 
too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn 
if love be rough with you be rough with love 
prick love for pricking and you beat love down 
give me a case to put my visage in:
a visor for a visor what care i
what curious eye doth quote deformities 
here are the beetle brows shall blush for me 
come knock and enter and no sooner in 
but every man betake him to his legs 
a torch for me: let wantons light of heart
tickle the senseless rushes with their heels 
for i am proverb d with a grandsire phrase 
i ll be a candle-holder and look on 
the game was ne er so fair and i am done 
tut dun s the mouse the constable s own word:
if thou art dun we ll draw thee from the mire
of this sir-reverence love wherein thou stick st
up to the ears come we burn daylight ho 
nay that s not so 
i mean sir in delay
we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day 
take our good meaning for our judgment sits
five times in that ere once in our five wits 
and we mean well in going to this mask 
but tis no wit to go 
why may one ask 
i dream d a dream to-night 
and so did i 
well what was yours 
that dreamers often lie 
in bed asleep while they do dream things true 
o then i see queen mab hath been with you 
she is the fairies midwife and she comes
in shape no bigger than an agate-stone
on the fore-finger of an alderman 
drawn with a team of little atomies
athwart men s noses as they lie asleep 
her wagon-spokes made of long spiders legs 
the cover of the wings of grasshoppers 
the traces of the smallest spider s web 
the collars of the moonshine s watery beams 
her whip of cricket s bone the lash of film 
her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat 
not so big as a round little worm
prick d from the lazy finger of a maid 
her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
made by the joiner squirrel or old grub 
time out o mind the fairies coachmakers 
and in this state she gallops night by night
through lovers brains and then they dream of love 
o er courtiers knees that dream on court sies straight 
o er lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees 
o er ladies lips who straight on kisses dream 
which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues 
because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
sometime she gallops o er a courtier s nose 
and then dreams he of smelling out a suit 
and sometime comes she with a tithe-pig s tail
tickling a parson s nose as a lies asleep 
then dreams he of another benefice:
sometime she driveth o er a soldier s neck 
and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats 
of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades 
of healths five-fathom deep and then anon
drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes 
and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
and sleeps again this is that very mab
that plats the manes of horses in the night 
and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs 
which once untangled much misfortune bodes:
this is the hag when maids lie on their backs 
that presses them and learns them first to bear 
making them women of good carriage:
this is she 
peace peace mercutio peace 
thou talk st of nothing 
true i talk of dreams 
which are the children of an idle brain 
begot of nothing but vain fantasy 
which is as thin of substance as the air
and more inconstant than the wind who wooes
even now the frozen bosom of the north 
and being anger d puffs away from thence 
turning his face to the dew-dropping south 
this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves 
supper is done and we shall come too late 
i fear too early: for my mind misgives
some consequence yet hanging in the stars
shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this night s revels and expire the term
of a despised life closed in my breast
by some vile forfeit of untimely death 
but he that hath the steerage of my course 
direct my sail on lusty gentlemen 
strike drum 
where s potpan that he helps not to take away he
shift a trencher he scrape a trencher 
when good manners shall lie all in one or two men s
hands and they unwashed too tis a foul thing 
away with the joint-stools remove the
court-cupboard look to the plate good thou save
me a piece of marchpane and as thou lovest me let
the porter let in susan grindstone and nell 
antony and potpan 
ay boy ready 
you are looked for and called for asked for and
sought for in the great chamber 
we cannot be here and there too cheerly boys be
brisk awhile and the longer liver take all 
welcome gentlemen ladies that have their toes
unplagued with corns will have a bout with you 
ah ha my mistresses which of you all
will now deny to dance she that makes dainty 
she i ll swear hath corns am i come near ye now 
welcome gentlemen i have seen the day
that i have worn a visor and could tell
a whispering tale in a fair lady s ear 
such as would please: tis gone tis gone tis gone:
you are welcome gentlemen come musicians play 
a hall a hall give room and foot it girls 
more light you knaves and turn the tables up 
and quench the fire the room is grown too hot 
ah sirrah this unlook d-for sport comes well 
nay sit nay sit good cousin capulet 
for you and i are past our dancing days:
how long is t now since last yourself and i
were in a mask 
second capulet
by r lady thirty years 
what man tis not so much tis not so much:
tis since the nuptials of lucentio 
come pentecost as quickly as it will 
some five and twenty years and then we mask d 
second capulet
tis more tis more his son is elder sir 
his son is thirty 
will you tell me that 
his son was but a ward two years ago 
[to a servingman] what lady is that which doth
enrich the hand
of yonder knight 
i know not sir 
o she doth teach the torches to burn bright 
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
like a rich jewel in an ethiope s ear 
beauty too rich for use for earth too dear 
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows 
as yonder lady o er her fellows shows 
the measure done i ll watch her place of stand 
and touching hers make blessed my rude hand 
did my heart love till now forswear it sight 
for i ne er saw true beauty till this night 
this by his voice should be a montague 
fetch me my rapier boy what dares the slave
come hither cover d with an antic face 
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity 
now by the stock and honour of my kin 
to strike him dead i hold it not a sin 
why how now kinsman wherefore storm you so 
uncle this is a montague our foe 
a villain that is hither come in spite 
to scorn at our solemnity this night 
young romeo is it 
tis he that villain romeo 
content thee gentle coz let him alone 
he bears him like a portly gentleman 
and to say truth verona brags of him
to be a virtuous and well-govern d youth:
i would not for the wealth of all the town
here in my house do him disparagement:
therefore be patient take no note of him:
it is my will the which if thou respect 
show a fair presence and put off these frowns 
and ill-beseeming semblance for a feast 
it fits when such a villain is a guest:
i ll not endure him 
he shall be endured:
what goodman boy i say he shall: go to 
am i the master here or you go to 
you ll not endure him god shall mend my soul 
you ll make a mutiny among my guests 
you will set cock-a-hoop you ll be the man 
why uncle tis a shame 
go to go to 
you are a saucy boy: is t so indeed 
this trick may chance to scathe you i know what:
you must contrary me marry tis time 
well said my hearts you are a princox go:
be quiet or more light more light for shame 
i ll make you quiet what cheerly my hearts 
patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting 
i will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall 
if i profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine the gentle fine is this:
my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand
to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss 
good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much 
which mannerly devotion shows in this 
for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch 
and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss 
have not saints lips and holy palmers too 
ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer 
o then dear saint let lips do what hands do 
they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair 
saints do not move though grant for prayers sake 
then move not while my prayer s effect i take 
thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged 
then have my lips the sin that they have took 
sin from thy lips o trespass sweetly urged 
give me my sin again 
you kiss by the book 
madam your mother craves a word with you 
what is her mother 
marry bachelor 
her mother is the lady of the house 
and a good lady and a wise and virtuous
i nurse her daughter that you talk d withal 
i tell you he that can lay hold of her
shall have the chinks 
is she a capulet 
o dear account my life is my foe s debt 
away begone the sport is at the best 
ay so i fear the more is my unrest 
nay gentlemen prepare not to be gone 
we have a trifling foolish banquet towards 
is it e en so why then i thank you all
i thank you honest gentlemen good night 
more torches here come on then let s to bed 
ah sirrah by my fay it waxes late:
i ll to my rest 
come hither nurse what is yond gentleman 
the son and heir of old tiberio 
what s he that now is going out of door 
marry that i think be young petrucio 
what s he that follows there that would not dance 
i know not 
go ask his name: if he be married 
my grave is like to be my wedding bed 
his name is romeo and a montague 
the only son of your great enemy 
my only love sprung from my only hate 
too early seen unknown and known too late 
prodigious birth of love it is to me 
that i must love a loathed enemy 
what s this what s this 
a rhyme i learn d even now
of one i danced withal 
anon anon 
come let s away the strangers all are gone 
chorus
now old desire doth in his death-bed lie 
and young affection gapes to be his heir 
that fair for which love groan d for and would die 
with tender juliet match d is now not fair 
now romeo is beloved and loves again 
alike betwitched by the charm of looks 
but to his foe supposed he must complain 
and she steal love s sweet bait from fearful hooks:
being held a foe he may not have access
to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear 
and she as much in love her means much less
to meet her new-beloved any where:
but passion lends them power time means to meet
tempering extremities with extreme sweet 
can i go forward when my heart is here 
turn back dull earth and find thy centre out 
he climbs the wall and leaps down within it
romeo my cousin romeo 
he is wise 
and on my lie hath stol n him home to bed 
he ran this way and leap d this orchard wall:
call good mercutio 
nay i ll conjure too 
romeo humours madman passion lover 
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
speak but one rhyme and i am satisfied 
cry but ay me pronounce but love and dove 
speak to my gossip venus one fair word 
one nick-name for her purblind son and heir 
young adam cupid he that shot so trim 
when king cophetua loved the beggar-maid 
he heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not 
the ape is dead and i must conjure him 
i conjure thee by rosaline s bright eyes 
by her high forehead and her scarlet lip 
by her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
and the demesnes that there adjacent lie 
that in thy likeness thou appear to us 
and if he hear thee thou wilt anger him 
this cannot anger him: twould anger him
to raise a spirit in his mistress circle
of some strange nature letting it there stand
till she had laid it and conjured it down 
that were some spite: my invocation
is fair and honest and in his mistres s name
i conjure only but to raise up him 
come he hath hid himself among these trees 
to be consorted with the humorous night:
blind is his love and best befits the dark 
if love be blind love cannot hit the mark 
now will he sit under a medlar tree 
and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
as maids call medlars when they laugh alone 
romeo that she were o that she were
an open et caetera thou a poperin pear 
romeo good night: i ll to my truckle-bed 
this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
come shall we go 
go then for tis in vain
to seek him here that means not to be found 
he jests at scars that never felt a wound 
male appears above at a window
but soft what light through yonder window breaks 
it is the east and juliet is the sun 
arise fair sun and kill the envious moon 
who is already sick and pale with grief 
that thou her maid art far more fair than she:
be not her maid since she is envious 
her vestal livery is but sick and green
and none but fools do wear it cast it off 
it is my lady o it is my love 
o that she knew she were 
she speaks yet she says nothing: what of that 
her eye discourses i will answer it 
i am too bold tis not to me she speaks:
two of the fairest stars in all the heaven 
having some business do entreat her eyes
to twinkle in their spheres till they return 
what if her eyes were there they in her head 
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars 
as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
would through the airy region stream so bright
that birds would sing and think it were not night 
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand 
o that i were a glove upon that hand 
that i might touch that cheek 
ay me 
she speaks:
o speak again bright angel for thou art
as glorious to this night being o er my head
as is a winged messenger of heaven
unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
when he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
and sails upon the bosom of the air 
o romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo 
deny thy father and refuse thy name 
or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love 
and i ll no longer be a capulet 
[aside] shall i hear more or shall i speak at this 
tis but thy name that is my enemy 
thou art thyself though not a montague 
what s montague it is nor hand nor foot 
nor arm nor face nor any other part
belonging to a man o be some other name 
what s in a name that which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet 
so romeo would were he not romeo call d 
retain that dear perfection which he owes
without that title romeo doff thy name 
and for that name which is no part of thee
take all myself 
i take thee at thy word:
call me but love and i ll be new baptized 
henceforth i never will be romeo 
what man art thou that thus bescreen d in night
so stumblest on my counsel 
by a name
i know not how to tell thee who i am:
my name dear saint is hateful to myself 
because it is an enemy to thee 
had i it written i would tear the word 
my ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
of that tongue s utterance yet i know the sound:
art thou not romeo and a montague 
neither fair saint if either thee dislike 
how camest thou hither tell me and wherefore 
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb 
and the place death considering who thou art 
if any of my kinsmen find thee here 
with love s light wings did i o er-perch these walls 
for stony limits cannot hold love out 
and what love can do that dares love attempt 
therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me 
if they do see thee they will murder thee 
alack there lies more peril in thine eye
than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet 
and i am proof against their enmity 
i would not for the world they saw thee here 
i have night s cloak to hide me from their sight 
and but thou love me let them find me here:
my life were better ended by their hate 
than death prorogued wanting of thy love 
by whose direction found st thou out this place 
by love who first did prompt me to inquire 
he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes 
i am no pilot yet wert thou as far
as that vast shore wash d with the farthest sea 
i would adventure for such merchandise 
thou know st the mask of night is on my face 
else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
for that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny
what i have spoke: but farewell compliment 
dost thou love me i know thou wilt say ay 
and i will take thy word: yet if thou swear st 
thou mayst prove false at lovers perjuries
then say jove laughs o gentle romeo 
if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully:
or if thou think st i am too quickly won 
i ll frown and be perverse an say thee nay 
so thou wilt woo but else not for the world 
in truth fair montague i am too fond 
and therefore thou mayst think my havior light:
but trust me gentleman i ll prove more true
than those that have more cunning to be strange 
i should have been more strange i must confess 
but that thou overheard st ere i was ware 
my true love s passion: therefore pardon me 
and not impute this yielding to light love 
which the dark night hath so discovered 
lady by yonder blessed moon i swear
that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops 
o swear not by the moon the inconstant moon 
that monthly changes in her circled orb 
lest that thy love prove likewise variable 
what shall i swear by 
do not swear at all 
or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self 
which is the god of my idolatry 
and i ll believe thee 
if my heart s dear love 
well do not swear: although i joy in thee 
i have no joy of this contract to-night:
it is too rash too unadvised too sudden 
too like the lightning which doth cease to be
ere one can say it lightens sweet good night 
this bud of love by summer s ripening breath 
may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet 
good night good night as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart as that within my breast 
o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied 
what satisfaction canst thou have to-night 
the exchange of thy love s faithful vow for mine 
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
and yet i would it were to give again 
wouldst thou withdraw it for what purpose love 
but to be frank and give it thee again 
and yet i wish but for the thing i have:
my bounty is as boundless as the sea 
my love as deep the more i give to thee 
the more i have for both are infinite 
i hear some noise within dear love adieu 
anon good male sweet montague be true 
stay but a little i will come again 
o blessed blessed night i am afeard 
being in night all this is but a dream 
too flattering-sweet to be substantial 
three words dear romeo and good night indeed 
if that thy bent of love be honourable 
thy purpose marriage send me word to-morrow 
by one that i ll procure to come to thee 
where and what time thou wilt perform the rite 
and all my fortunes at thy foot i ll lay
and follow thee my lord throughout the world 
madam 
i come anon but if thou mean st not well 
i do beseech thee 
[within] madam 
by and by i come: 
to cease thy suit and leave me to my grief:
to-morrow will i send 
so thrive my soul 
a thousand times good night 
a thousand times the worse to want thy light 
love goes toward love as schoolboys from
their books 
but love from love toward school with heavy looks 
hist romeo hist o for a falconer s voice 
to lure this tassel-gentle back again 
bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud 
else would i tear the cave where echo lies 
and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine 
with repetition of my romeo s name 
it is my soul that calls upon my name:
how silver-sweet sound lovers tongues by night 
like softest music to attending ears 
romeo 
my dear 
at what o clock to-morrow
shall i send to thee 
at the hour of nine 
i will not fail: tis twenty years till then 
i have forgot why i did call thee back 
let me stand here till thou remember it 
i shall forget to have thee still stand there 
remembering how i love thy company 
and i ll still stay to have thee still forget 
forgetting any other home but this 
tis almost morning i would have thee gone:
and yet no further than a wanton s bird 
who lets it hop a little from her hand 
like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves 
and with a silk thread plucks it back again 
so loving-jealous of his liberty 
i would i were thy bird 
sweet so would i:
yet i should kill thee with much cherishing 
good night good night parting is such
sweet sorrow 
that i shall say good night till it be morrow 
sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast 
would i were sleep and peace so sweet to rest 
hence will i to my ghostly father s cell 
his help to crave and my dear hap to tell 
the grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night 
chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light 
and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
from forth day s path and titan s fiery wheels:
now ere the sun advance his burning eye 
the day to cheer and night s dank dew to dry 
i must up-fill this osier cage of ours
with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers 
the earth that s nature s mother is her tomb 
what is her burying grave that is her womb 
and from her womb children of divers kind
we sucking on her natural bosom find 
many for many virtues excellent 
none but for some and yet all different 
o mickle is the powerful grace that lies
in herbs plants stones and their true qualities:
for nought so vile that on the earth doth live
but to the earth some special good doth give 
nor aught so good but strain d from that fair use
revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse:
virtue itself turns vice being misapplied 
and vice sometimes by action dignified 
within the infant rind of this small flower
poison hath residence and medicine power:
for this being smelt with that part cheers each part 
being tasted slays all senses with the heart 
two such opposed kings encamp them still
in man as well as herbs grace and rude will 
and where the worser is predominant 
full soon the canker death eats up that plant 
good morrow father 
benedicite 
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me 
young son it argues a distemper d head
so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
care keeps his watch in every old man s eye 
and where care lodges sleep will never lie 
but where unbruised youth with unstuff d brain
doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign:
therefore thy earliness doth me assure
thou art up-roused by some distemperature 
or if not so then here i hit it right 
our romeo hath not been in bed to-night 
that last is true the sweeter rest was mine 
god pardon sin wast thou with rosaline 
with rosaline my ghostly father no 
i have forgot that name and that name s woe 
that s my good son: but where hast thou been then 
i ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again 
i have been feasting with mine enemy 
where on a sudden one hath wounded me 
that s by me wounded: both our remedies
within thy help and holy physic lies:
i bear no hatred blessed man for lo 
my intercession likewise steads my foe 
be plain good son and homely in thy drift 
riddling confession finds but riddling shrift 
then plainly know my heart s dear love is set
on the fair daughter of rich capulet:
as mine on hers so hers is set on mine 
and all combined save what thou must combine
by holy marriage: when and where and how
we met we woo d and made exchange of vow 
i ll tell thee as we pass but this i pray 
that thou consent to marry us to-day 
holy saint francis what a change is here 
is rosaline whom thou didst love so dear 
so soon forsaken young men s love then lies
not truly in their hearts but in their eyes 
jesu maria what a deal of brine
hath wash d thy sallow cheeks for rosaline 
how much salt water thrown away in waste 
to season love that of it doth not taste 
the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears 
thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears 
lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
of an old tear that is not wash d off yet:
if e er thou wast thyself and these woes thine 
thou and these woes were all for rosaline:
and art thou changed pronounce this sentence then 
women may fall when there s no strength in men 
thou chid st me oft for loving rosaline 
for doting not for loving pupil mine 
and bad st me bury love 
not in a grave 
to lay one in another out to have 
i pray thee chide not she whom i love now
doth grace for grace and love for love allow 
the other did not so 
o she knew well
thy love did read by rote and could not spell 
but come young waverer come go with me 
in one respect i ll thy assistant be 
for this alliance may so happy prove 
to turn your households rancour to pure love 
o let us hence i stand on sudden haste 
wisely and slow they stumble that run fast 
where the devil should this romeo be 
came he not home to-night 
not to his father s i spoke with his man 
ah that same pale hard-hearted wench that rosaline 
torments him so that he will sure run mad 
tybalt the kinsman of old capulet 
hath sent a letter to his father s house 
a challenge on my life 
romeo will answer it 
any man that can write may answer a letter 
nay he will answer the letter s master how he
dares being dared 
alas poor romeo he is already dead stabbed with a
white wench s black eye shot through the ear with a
love-song the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy s butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encounter tybalt 
why what is tybalt 
more than prince of cats i can tell you o he is
the courageous captain of compliments he fights as
you sing prick-song keeps time distance and
proportion rests me his minim rest one two and
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
button a duellist a duellist a gentleman of the
very first house of the first and second cause:
ah the immortal passado the punto reverso the
hai 
the what 
the pox of such antic lisping affecting
fantasticoes these new tuners of accents by jesu 
a very good blade a very tall man a very good
whore why is not this a lamentable thing 
grandsire that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies these fashion-mongers these
perdona-mi s who stand so much on the new form 
that they cannot at ease on the old bench o their
bones their bones 
here comes romeo here comes romeo 
without his roe like a dried herring: flesh flesh 
how art thou fishified now is he for the numbers
that petrarch flowed in: laura to his lady was but a
kitchen-wench marry she had a better love to
be-rhyme her dido a dowdy cleopatra a gipsy 
helen and hero hildings and harlots thisbe a grey
eye or so but not to the purpose signior
romeo bon jour there s a french salutation
to your french slop you gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night 
good morrow to you both what counterfeit did i give you 
the ship sir the slip can you not conceive 
pardon good mercutio my business was great and in
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy 
that s as much as to say such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams 
meaning to court sy 
thou hast most kindly hit it 
a most courteous exposition 
nay i am the very pink of courtesy 
pink for flower 
right 
why then is my pump well flowered 
well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
worn out thy pump that when the single sole of it
is worn the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular 
o single-soled jest solely singular for the
singleness 
come between us good benvolio my wits faint 
switch and spurs switch and spurs or i ll cry a match 
nay if thy wits run the wild-goose chase i have
done for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
thy wits than i am sure i have in my whole five:
was i with you there for the goose 
thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
not there for the goose 
i will bite thee by the ear for that jest 
nay good goose bite not 
thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most
sharp sauce 
and is it not well served in to a sweet goose 
o here s a wit of cheveril that stretches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad 
i stretch it out for that word broad which added
to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose 
why is not this better now than groaning for love 
now art thou sociable now art thou romeo now art
thou what thou art by art as well as by nature:
for this drivelling love is like a great natural 
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole 
stop there stop there 
thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair 
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large 
o thou art deceived i would have made it short:
for i was come to the whole depth of my tale and
meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer 
here s goodly gear 
a sail a sail 
two two a shirt and a smock

my fan peter 
good peter to hide her face for her fan s the
fairer face 
god ye good morrow gentlemen 
god ye good den fair gentlewoman 
is it good den 
tis no less i tell you for the bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the prick of noon 
out upon you what a man are you 
one gentlewoman that god hath made for himself to
mar 
by my troth it is well said for himself to mar 
quoth a gentlemen can any of you tell me where i
may find the young romeo 
i can tell you but young romeo will be older when
you have found him than he was when you sought him:
i am the youngest of that name for fault of a worse 
you say well 
yea is the worst well very well took i faith 
wisely wisely 
if you be he sir i desire some confidence with
you 
she will indite him to some supper 
a bawd a bawd a bawd so ho 
what hast thou found 
no hare sir unless a hare sir in a lenten pie 
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent 
an old hare hoar 
and an old hare hoar 
is very good meat in lent
but a hare that is hoar
is too much for a score 
when it hoars ere it be spent 
romeo will you come to your father s we ll
to dinner thither 
i will follow you 
farewell ancient lady farewell 
lady lady lady 
marry farewell i pray you sir what saucy
merchant was this that was so full of his ropery 
a gentleman nurse that loves to hear himself talk 
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
to in a month 
an a speak any thing against me i ll take him
down an a were lustier than he is and twenty such
jacks and if i cannot i ll find those that shall 
scurvy knave i am none of his flirt-gills i am
none of his skains-mates and thou must stand by
too and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure 
i saw no man use you a pleasure if i had my weapon
should quickly have been out i warrant you: i dare
draw as soon as another man if i see occasion in a
good quarrel and the law on my side 
now afore god i am so vexed that every part about
me quivers scurvy knave pray you sir a word:
and as i told you my young lady bade me inquire you
out what she bade me say i will keep to myself:
but first let me tell ye if ye should lead her into
a fool s paradise as they say it were a very gross
kind of behavior as they say: for the gentlewoman
is young and therefore if you should deal double
with her truly it were an ill thing to be offered
to any gentlewoman and very weak dealing 
male commend me to thy lady and mistress i
protest unto thee 
good heart and i faith i will tell her as much:
lord lord she will be a joyful woman 
what wilt thou tell her nurse thou dost not mark me 
i will tell her sir that you do protest which as
i take it is a gentlemanlike offer 
bid her devise
some means to come to shrift this afternoon 
and there she shall at friar laurence cell
be shrived and married here is for thy pains 
no truly sir not a penny 
go to i say you shall 
this afternoon sir well she shall be there 
and stay good nurse behind the abbey wall:
within this hour my man shall be with thee
and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair 
which to the high top-gallant of my joy
must be my convoy in the secret night 
farewell be trusty and i ll quit thy pains:
farewell commend me to thy mistress 
now god in heaven bless thee hark you sir 
what say st thou my dear nurse 
is your man secret did you ne er hear say 
two may keep counsel putting one away 
i warrant thee my man s as true as steel 
well sir my mistress is the sweetest lady lord 
lord when twas a little prating thing: o there
is a nobleman in town one paris that would fain
lay knife aboard but she good soul had as lief
see a toad a very toad as see him i anger her
sometimes and tell her that paris is the properer
man but i ll warrant you when i say so she looks
as pale as any clout in the versal world doth not
rosemary and romeo begin both with a letter 
ay nurse what of that both with an r 
ah mocker that s the dog s name r is for
the no i know it begins with some other
letter: and she hath the prettiest sententious of
it of you and rosemary that it would do you good
to hear it 
commend me to thy lady 
ay a thousand times 
peter 
anon 
peter take my fan and go before and apace 
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse 
in half an hour she promised to return 
perchance she cannot meet him: that s not so 
o she is lame love s heralds should be thoughts 
which ten times faster glide than the sun s beams 
driving back shadows over louring hills:
therefore do nimble-pinion d doves draw love 
and therefore hath the wind-swift cupid wings 
now is the sun upon the highmost hill
of this day s journey and from nine till twelve
is three long hours yet she is not come 
had she affections and warm youthful blood 
she would be as swift in motion as a ball 
my words would bandy her to my sweet love 
and his to me:
but old folks many feign as they were dead 
unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead 
o god she comes 
o honey nurse what news 
hast thou met with him send thy man away 
peter stay at the gate 
now good sweet nurse —o lord why look st thou sad 
though news be sad yet tell them merrily 
if good thou shamest the music of sweet news
by playing it to me with so sour a face 
i am a-weary give me leave awhile:
fie how my bones ache what a jaunt have i had 
i would thou hadst my bones and i thy news:
nay come i pray thee speak good good nurse speak 
jesu what haste can you not stay awhile 
do you not see that i am out of breath 
how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
to say to me that thou art out of breath 
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay
is longer than the tale thou dost excuse 
is thy news good or bad answer to that 
say either and i ll stay the circumstance:
let me be satisfied is t good or bad 
well you have made a simple choice you know not
how to choose a man: romeo no not he though his
face be better than any man s yet his leg excels
all men s and for a hand and a foot and a body 
though they be not to be talked on yet they are
past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy 
but i ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb go thy
ways wench serve god what have you dined at home 
no no: but all this did i know before 
what says he of our marriage what of that 
lord how my head aches what a head have i 
it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces 
my back o t other side o my back my back 
beshrew your heart for sending me about 
to catch my death with jaunting up and down 
i faith i am sorry that thou art not well 
sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love 
your love says like an honest gentleman and a
courteous and a kind and a handsome and i
warrant a virtuous where is your mother 
where is my mother why she is within 
where should she be how oddly thou repliest 
your love says like an honest gentleman 
where is your mother 
o god s lady dear 
are you so hot marry come up i trow 
is this the poultice for my aching bones 
henceforward do your messages yourself 
here s such a coil come what says romeo 
have you got leave to go to shrift to-day 
i have 
then hie you hence to friar laurence cell 
there stays a husband to make you a wife:
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks 
they ll be in scarlet straight at any news 
hie you to church i must another way 
to fetch a ladder by the which your love
must climb a bird s nest soon when it is dark:
i am the drudge and toil in your delight 
but you shall bear the burden soon at night 
go i ll to dinner: hie you to the cell 
hie to high fortune honest nurse farewell 
so smile the heavens upon this holy act 
that after hours with sorrow chide us not 
amen amen but come what sorrow can 
it cannot countervail the exchange of joy
that one short minute gives me in her sight:
do thou but close our hands with holy words 
then love-devouring death do what he dare 
it is enough i may but call her mine 
these violent delights have violent ends
and in their triumph die like fire and powder 
which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
is loathsome in his own deliciousness
and in the taste confounds the appetite:
therefore love moderately long love doth so 
too swift arrives as tardy as too slow 
here comes the lady: o so light a foot
will ne er wear out the everlasting flint:
a lover may bestride the gossamer
that idles in the wanton summer air 
and yet not fall so light is vanity 
good even to my ghostly confessor 
romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both 
as much to him else is his thanks too much 
ah juliet if the measure of thy joy
be heap d like mine and that thy skill be more
to blazon it then sweeten with thy breath
this neighbour air and let rich music s tongue
unfold the imagined happiness that both
receive in either by this dear encounter 
conceit more rich in matter than in words 
brags of his substance not of ornament:
they are but beggars that can count their worth 
but my true love is grown to such excess
i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth 
come come with me and we will make short work 
for by your leaves you shall not stay alone
till holy church incorporate two in one 
i pray thee good mercutio let s retire:
the day is hot the capulets abroad 
and if we meet we shall not scape a brawl 
for now these hot days is the mad blood stirring 
thou art like one of those fellows that when he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says god send me no need of
thee and by the operation of the second cup draws
it on the drawer when indeed there is no need 
am i like such a fellow 
come come thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as
any in italy and as soon moved to be moody and as
soon moody to be moved 
and what to 
nay an there were two such we should have none
shortly for one would kill the other thou why 
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more 
or a hair less in his beard than thou hast: thou
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel 
thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
man for coughing in the street because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before easter with another for
tying his new shoes with old riband and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling 
an i were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter 
the fee-simple o simple 
by my head here come the capulets 
by my heel i care not 
follow me close for i will speak to them 
gentlemen good den: a word with one of you 
and but one word with one of us couple it with
something make it a word and a blow 
you shall find me apt enough to that sir an you
will give me occasion 
could you not take some occasion without giving 
mercutio thou consort st with romeo 
consort what dost thou make us minstrels an
thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but
discords: here s my fiddlestick here s that shall
make you dance zounds consort 
we talk here in the public haunt of men:
either withdraw unto some private place 
and reason coldly of your grievances 
or else depart here all eyes gaze on us 
men s eyes were made to look and let them gaze 
i will not budge for no man s pleasure i 
well peace be with you sir: here comes my man 
but i ll be hanged sir if he wear your livery:
marry go before to field he ll be your follower 
your worship in that sense may call him man 
romeo the hate i bear thee can afford
no better term than this thou art a villain 
tybalt the reason that i have to love thee
doth much excuse the appertaining rage
to such a greeting: villain am i none 
therefore farewell i see thou know st me not 
boy this shall not excuse the injuries
that thou hast done me therefore turn and draw 
i do protest i never injured thee 
but love thee better than thou canst devise 
till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
and so good capulet which name i tender
as dearly as my own be satisfied 
o calm dishonourable vile submission 
alla stoccata carries it away 
draws
tybalt you rat-catcher will you walk 
what wouldst thou have with me 
good king of cats nothing but one of your nine
lives that i mean to make bold withal and as you
shall use me hereafter drybeat the rest of the
eight will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
by the ears make haste lest mine be about your
ears ere it be out 
i am for you 
drawing
gentle mercutio put thy rapier up 
come sir your passado 
draw benvolio beat down their weapons 
gentlemen for shame forbear this outrage 
tybalt mercutio the prince expressly hath
forbidden bandying in verona streets:
hold tybalt good mercutio 
i am hurt 
a plague o both your houses i am sped 
is he gone and hath nothing 
what art thou hurt 
ay ay a scratch a scratch marry tis enough 
where is my page go villain fetch a surgeon 
courage man the hurt cannot be much 
no tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a
church-door but tis enough twill serve: ask for
me to-morrow and you shall find me a grave man i
am peppered i warrant for this world a plague o 
both your houses zounds a dog a rat a mouse a
cat to scratch a man to death a braggart a
rogue a villain that fights by the book of
arithmetic why the devil came you between us i
was hurt under your arm 
i thought all for the best 
help me into some house benvolio 
or i shall faint a plague o both your houses 
they have made worms meat of me: i have it 
and soundly too: your houses 
this gentleman the prince s near ally 
my very friend hath got his mortal hurt
in my behalf my reputation stain d
with tybalt s slander tybalt that an hour
hath been my kinsman o sweet juliet 
thy beauty hath made me effeminate
and in my temper soften d valour s steel 
o romeo romeo brave mercutio s dead 
that gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds 
which too untimely here did scorn the earth 
this day s black fate on more days doth depend 
this but begins the woe others must end 
here comes the furious tybalt back again 
alive in triumph and mercutio slain 
away to heaven respective lenity 
and fire-eyed fury be my conduct now 
now tybalt take the villain back again 
that late thou gavest me for mercutio s soul
is but a little way above our heads 
staying for thine to keep him company:
either thou or i or both must go with him 
thou wretched boy that didst consort him here 
shalt with him hence 
this shall determine that 
romeo away be gone 
the citizens are up and tybalt slain 
stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death 
if thou art taken: hence be gone away 
o i am fortune s fool 
why dost thou stay 
first citizen
which way ran he that kill d mercutio 
tybalt that murderer which way ran he 
there lies that tybalt 
first citizen
up sir go with me 
i charge thee in the princes name obey 
where are the vile beginners of this fray 
o noble prince i can discover all
the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
there lies the man slain by young romeo 
that slew thy kinsman brave mercutio 
tybalt my cousin o my brother s child 
o prince o cousin husband o the blood is spilt
o my dear kinsman prince as thou art true 
for blood of ours shed blood of montague 
o cousin cousin 
benvolio who began this bloody fray 
tybalt here slain whom romeo s hand did slay 
romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink
how nice the quarrel was and urged withal
your high displeasure: all this uttered
with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bow d 
could not take truce with the unruly spleen
of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
with piercing steel at bold mercutio s breast 
who all as hot turns deadly point to point 
and with a martial scorn with one hand beats
cold death aside and with the other sends
it back to tybalt whose dexterity 
retorts it: romeo he cries aloud 
hold friends friends part and swifter than
his tongue 
his agile arm beats down their fatal points 
and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled 
but by and by comes back to romeo 
who had but newly entertain d revenge 
and to t they go like lightning for ere i
could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain 
and as he fell did romeo turn and fly 
this is the truth or let benvolio die 
he is a kinsman to the montague 
affection makes him false he speaks not true:
some twenty of them fought in this black strife 
and all those twenty could but kill one life 
i beg for justice which thou prince must give 
romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live 
romeo slew him he slew mercutio 
who now the price of his dear blood doth owe 
not romeo prince he was mercutio s friend 
his fault concludes but what the law should end 
the life of tybalt 
and for that offence
immediately we do exile him hence:
i have an interest in your hate s proceeding 
my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding 
but i ll amerce you with so strong a fine
that you shall all repent the loss of mine:
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses 
nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
therefore use none: let romeo hence in haste 
else when he s found that hour is his last 
bear hence this body and attend our will:
mercy but murders pardoning those that kill 
gallop apace you fiery-footed steeds 
towards phoebus lodging: such a wagoner
as phaethon would whip you to the west 
and bring in cloudy night immediately 
spread thy close curtain love-performing night 
that runaway s eyes may wink and romeo
leap to these arms untalk d of and unseen 
lovers can see to do their amorous rites
by their own beauties or if love be blind 
it best agrees with night come civil night 
thou sober-suited matron all in black 
and learn me how to lose a winning match 
play d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
hood my unmann d blood bating in my cheeks 
with thy black mantle till strange love grown bold 
think true love acted simple modesty 
come night come romeo come thou day in night 
for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
whiter than new snow on a raven s back 
come gentle night come loving black-brow d night 
give me my romeo and when he shall die 
take him and cut him out in little stars 
and he will make the face of heaven so fine
that all the world will be in love with night
and pay no worship to the garish sun 
o i have bought the mansion of a love 
but not possess d it and though i am sold 
not yet enjoy d: so tedious is this day
as is the night before some festival
to an impatient child that hath new robes
and may not wear them o here comes my nurse 
and she brings news and every tongue that speaks
but romeo s name speaks heavenly eloquence 
now nurse what news what hast thou there the cords
that romeo bid thee fetch 
ay ay the cords 
ay me what news why dost thou wring thy hands 
ah well-a-day he s dead he s dead he s dead 
we are undone lady we are undone 
alack the day he s gone he s kill d he s dead 
can heaven be so envious 
romeo can 
though heaven cannot: o romeo romeo 
who ever would have thought it romeo 
what devil art thou that dost torment me thus 
this torture should be roar d in dismal hell 
hath romeo slain himself say thou but i 
and that bare vowel i shall poison more
than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
i am not i if there be such an i 
or those eyes shut that make thee answer i 
if he be slain say i or if not no:
brief sounds determine of my weal or woe 
i saw the wound i saw it with mine eyes 
god save the mark here on his manly breast:
a piteous corse a bloody piteous corse 
pale pale as ashes all bedaub d in blood 
all in gore-blood i swounded at the sight 
o break my heart poor bankrupt break at once 
to prison eyes ne er look on liberty 
vile earth to earth resign end motion here 
and thou and romeo press one heavy bier 
o tybalt tybalt the best friend i had 
o courteous tybalt honest gentleman 
that ever i should live to see thee dead 
what storm is this that blows so contrary 
is romeo slaughter d and is tybalt dead 
my dear-loved cousin and my dearer lord 
then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom 
for who is living if those two are gone 
tybalt is gone and romeo banished 
romeo that kill d him he is banished 
o god did romeo s hand shed tybalt s blood 
it did it did alas the day it did 
o serpent heart hid with a flowering face 
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave 
beautiful tyrant fiend angelical 
dove-feather d raven wolvish-ravening lamb 
despised substance of divinest show 
just opposite to what thou justly seem st 
a damned saint an honourable villain 
o nature what hadst thou to do in hell 
when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
in moral paradise of such sweet flesh 
was ever book containing such vile matter
so fairly bound o that deceit should dwell
in such a gorgeous palace 
there s no trust 
no faith no honesty in men all perjured 
all forsworn all naught all dissemblers 
ah where s my man give me some aqua vitae:
these griefs these woes these sorrows make me old 
shame come to romeo 
blister d be thy tongue
for such a wish he was not born to shame:
upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit 
for tis a throne where honour may be crown d
sole monarch of the universal earth 
o what a beast was i to chide at him 
will you speak well of him that kill d your cousin 
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband 
ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name 
when i thy three-hours wife have mangled it 
but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin 
that villain cousin would have kill d my husband:
back foolish tears back to your native spring 
your tributary drops belong to woe 
which you mistaking offer up to joy 
my husband lives that tybalt would have slain 
and tybalt s dead that would have slain my husband:
all this is comfort wherefore weep i then 
some word there was worser than tybalt s death 
that murder d me: i would forget it fain 
but o it presses to my memory 
like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds:
tybalt is dead and romeo banished 
that banished that one word banished 
hath slain ten thousand tybalts tybalt s death
was woe enough if it had ended there:
or if sour woe delights in fellowship
and needly will be rank d with other griefs 
why follow d not when she said tybalt s dead 
thy father or thy mother nay or both 
which modern lamentations might have moved 
but with a rear-ward following tybalt s death 
romeo is banished to speak that word 
is father mother tybalt romeo juliet 
all slain all dead romeo is banished 
there is no end no limit measure bound 
in that word s death no words can that woe sound 
where is my father and my mother nurse 
weeping and wailing over tybalt s corse:
will you go to them i will bring you thither 
wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent 
when theirs are dry for romeo s banishment 
take up those cords: poor ropes you are beguiled 
both you and i for romeo is exiled:
he made you for a highway to my bed 
but i a maid die maiden-widowed 
come cords come nurse i ll to my wedding-bed 
and death not romeo take my maidenhead 
hie to your chamber: i ll find romeo
to comfort you: i wot well where he is 
hark ye your romeo will be here at night:
i ll to him he is hid at laurence cell 
o find him give this ring to my true knight 
and bid him come to take his last farewell 
romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man:
affliction is enamour d of thy parts 
and thou art wedded to calamity 
father what news what is the prince s doom 
what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand 
that i yet know not 
too familiar
is my dear son with such sour company:
i bring thee tidings of the prince s doom 
what less than dooms-day is the prince s doom 
a gentler judgment vanish d from his lips 
not body s death but body s banishment 
ha banishment be merciful say death 
for exile hath more terror in his look 
much more than death: do not say banishment 
hence from verona art thou banished:
be patient for the world is broad and wide 
there is no world without verona walls 
but purgatory torture hell itself 
hence-banished is banish d from the world 
and world s exile is death: then banished 
is death mis-term d: calling death banishment 
thou cutt st my head off with a golden axe 
and smilest upon the stroke that murders me 
o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness 
thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince 
taking thy part hath rush d aside the law 
and turn d that black word death to banishment:
this is dear mercy and thou seest it not 
tis torture and not mercy: heaven is here 
where juliet lives and every cat and dog
and little mouse every unworthy thing 
live here in heaven and may look on her 
but romeo may not: more validity 
more honourable state more courtship lives
in carrion-flies than romeo: they my seize
on the white wonder of dear juliet s hand
and steal immortal blessing from her lips 
who even in pure and vestal modesty 
still blush as thinking their own kisses sin 
but romeo may not he is banished:
flies may do this but i from this must fly:
they are free men but i am banished 
and say st thou yet that exile is not death 
hadst thou no poison mix d no sharp-ground knife 
no sudden mean of death though ne er so mean 
but banished to kill me banished 
o friar the damned use that word in hell 
howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart 
being a divine a ghostly confessor 
a sin-absolver and my friend profess d 
to mangle me with that word banished 
thou fond mad man hear me but speak a word 
o thou wilt speak again of banishment 
i ll give thee armour to keep off that word:
adversity s sweet milk philosophy 
to comfort thee though thou art banished 
yet banished hang up philosophy 
unless philosophy can make a juliet 
displant a town reverse a prince s doom 
it helps not it prevails not: talk no more 
o then i see that madmen have no ears 
how should they when that wise men have no eyes 
let me dispute with thee of thy estate 
thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
wert thou as young as i juliet thy love 
an hour but married tybalt murdered 
doting like me and like me banished 
then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair 
and fall upon the ground as i do now 
taking the measure of an unmade grave 
knocking within
arise one knocks good romeo hide thyself 
not i unless the breath of heartsick groans 
mist-like infold me from the search of eyes 
knocking
hark how they knock who s there romeo arise 
thou wilt be taken stay awhile stand up 
knocking
run to my study by and by god s will 
what simpleness is this i come i come 
knocking
who knocks so hard whence come you what s your will 
[within] let me come in and you shall know
my errand 
i come from lady juliet 
welcome then 
o holy friar o tell me holy friar 
where is my lady s lord where s romeo 
there on the ground with his own tears made drunk 
o he is even in my mistress case 
just in her case o woful sympathy 
piteous predicament even so lies she 
blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering 
stand up stand up stand and you be a man:
for juliet s sake for her sake rise and stand 
why should you fall into so deep an o 
nurse 
ah sir ah sir well death s the end of all 
spakest thou of juliet how is it with her 
doth she not think me an old murderer 
now i have stain d the childhood of our joy
with blood removed but little from her own 
where is she and how doth she and what says
my conceal d lady to our cancell d love 
o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps 
and now falls on her bed and then starts up 
and tybalt calls and then on romeo cries 
and then down falls again 
as if that name 
shot from the deadly level of a gun 
did murder her as that name s cursed hand
murder d her kinsman o tell me friar tell me 
in what vile part of this anatomy
doth my name lodge tell me that i may sack
the hateful mansion 
drawing his sword
hold thy desperate hand:
art thou a man thy form cries out thou art:
thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
the unreasonable fury of a beast:
unseemly woman in a seeming man 
or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both 
thou hast amazed me: by my holy order 
i thought thy disposition better temper d 
hast thou slain tybalt wilt thou slay thyself 
and stay thy lady too that lives in thee 
by doing damned hate upon thyself 
why rail st thou on thy birth the heaven and earth 
since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose 
fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit 
which like a usurer abound st in all 
and usest none in that true use indeed
which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit:
thy noble shape is but a form of wax 
digressing from the valour of a man 
thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury 
killing that love which thou hast vow d to cherish 
thy wit that ornament to shape and love 
misshapen in the conduct of them both 
like powder in a skitless soldier s flask 
is set afire by thine own ignorance 
and thou dismember d with thine own defence 
what rouse thee man thy juliet is alive 
for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead 
there art thou happy: tybalt would kill thee 
but thou slew st tybalt there are thou happy too:
the law that threaten d death becomes thy friend
and turns it to exile there art thou happy:
a pack of blessings lights up upon thy back 
happiness courts thee in her best array 
but like a misbehaved and sullen wench 
thou pout st upon thy fortune and thy love:
take heed take heed for such die miserable 
go get thee to thy love as was decreed 
ascend her chamber hence and comfort her:
but look thou stay not till the watch be set 
for then thou canst not pass to mantua 
where thou shalt live till we can find a time
to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends 
beg pardon of the prince and call thee back
with twenty hundred thousand times more joy
than thou went st forth in lamentation 
go before nurse: commend me to thy lady 
and bid her hasten all the house to bed 
which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
romeo is coming 
o lord i could have stay d here all the night
to hear good counsel: o what learning is 
my lord i ll tell my lady you will come 
do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide 
here sir a ring she bid me give you sir:
hie you make haste for it grows very late 
how well my comfort is revived by this 
go hence good night and here stands all your state:
either be gone before the watch be set 
or by the break of day disguised from hence:
sojourn in mantua i ll find out your man 
and he shall signify from time to time
every good hap to you that chances here:
give me thy hand tis late: farewell good night 
but that a joy past joy calls out on me 
it were a grief so brief to part with thee: farewell 
things have fall n out sir so unluckily 
that we have had no time to move our daughter:
look you she loved her kinsman tybalt dearly 
and so did i: well we were born to die 
tis very late she ll not come down to-night:
i promise you but for your company 
i would have been a-bed an hour ago 
these times of woe afford no time to woo 
madam good night: commend me to your daughter 
i will and know her mind early to-morrow 
to-night she is mew d up to her heaviness 
sir paris i will make a desperate tender
of my child s love: i think she will be ruled
in all respects by me nay more i doubt it not 
wife go you to her ere you go to bed 
acquaint her here of my son paris love 
and bid her mark you me on wednesday next 
but soft what day is this 
monday my lord 
monday ha ha well wednesday is too soon 
o thursday let it be: o thursday tell her 
she shall be married to this noble earl 
will you be ready do you like this haste 
we ll keep no great ado a friend or two 
for hark you tybalt being slain so late 
it may be thought we held him carelessly 
being our kinsman if we revel much:
therefore we ll have some half a dozen friends 
and there an end but what say you to thursday 
my lord i would that thursday were to-morrow 
well get you gone: o thursday be it then 
go you to juliet ere you go to bed 
prepare her wife against this wedding-day 
farewell my lord light to my chamber ho 
afore me it is so very very late 
that we may call it early by and by 
good night 
wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day:
it was the nightingale and not the lark 
that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear 
nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
believe me love it was the nightingale 
it was the lark the herald of the morn 
no nightingale: look love what envious streaks
do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
night s candles are burnt out and jocund day
stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops 
i must be gone and live or stay and die 
yon light is not day-light i know it i:
it is some meteor that the sun exhales 
to be to thee this night a torch-bearer 
and light thee on thy way to mantua:
therefore stay yet thou need st not to be gone 
let me be ta en let me be put to death 
i am content so thou wilt have it so 
i ll say yon grey is not the morning s eye 
tis but the pale reflex of cynthia s brow 
nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
the vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
i have more care to stay than will to go:
come death and welcome juliet wills it so 
how is t my soul let s talk it is not day 
it is it is: hie hence be gone away 
it is the lark that sings so out of tune 
straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps 
some say the lark makes sweet division 
this doth not so for she divideth us:
some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes 
o now i would they had changed voices too 
since arm from arm that voice doth us affray 
hunting thee hence with hunt s-up to the day 
o now be gone more light and light it grows 
more light and light more dark and dark our woes 
madam 
nurse 
your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
the day is broke be wary look about 
then window let day in and let life out 
farewell farewell one kiss and i ll descend 
he goeth down
art thou gone so love lord ay husband friend 
i must hear from thee every day in the hour 
for in a minute there are many days:
o by this count i shall be much in years
ere i again behold my romeo 
farewell 
i will omit no opportunity
that may convey my greetings love to thee 
o think st thou we shall ever meet again 
i doubt it not and all these woes shall serve
for sweet discourses in our time to come 
o god i have an ill-divining soul 
methinks i see thee now thou art below 
as one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
either my eyesight fails or thou look st pale 
and trust me love in my eye so do you:
dry sorrow drinks our blood adieu adieu 
o fortune fortune all men call thee fickle:
if thou art fickle what dost thou with him 
that is renown d for faith be fickle fortune 
for then i hope thou wilt not keep him long 
but send him back 
[within] ho daughter are you up 
who is t that calls is it my lady mother 
is she not down so late or up so early 
what unaccustom d cause procures her hither 
why how now juliet 
madam i am not well 
evermore weeping for your cousin s death 
what wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears 
an if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live 
therefore have done: some grief shows much of love 
but much of grief shows still some want of wit 
yet let me weep for such a feeling loss 
so shall you feel the loss but not the friend
which you weep for 
feeling so the loss 
cannot choose but ever weep the friend 
well girl thou weep st not so much for his death 
as that the villain lives which slaughter d him 
what villain madam 
that same villain romeo 
[aside] villain and he be many miles asunder 
god pardon him i do with all my heart 
and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart 
that is because the traitor murderer lives 
ay madam from the reach of these my hands:
would none but i might venge my cousin s death 
we will have vengeance for it fear thou not:
then weep no more i ll send to one in mantua 
where that same banish d runagate doth live 
shall give him such an unaccustom d dram 
that he shall soon keep tybalt company:
and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied 
indeed i never shall be satisfied
with romeo till i behold him dead 
is my poor heart for a kinsman vex d 
madam if you could find out but a man
to bear a poison i would temper it 
that romeo should upon receipt thereof 
soon sleep in quiet o how my heart abhors
to hear him named and cannot come to him 
to wreak the love i bore my cousin
upon his body that slaughter d him 
find thou the means and i ll find such a man 
but now i ll tell thee joyful tidings girl 
and joy comes well in such a needy time:
what are they i beseech your ladyship 
well well thou hast a careful father child 
one who to put thee from thy heaviness 
hath sorted out a sudden day of joy 
that thou expect st not nor i look d not for 
madam in happy time what day is that 
marry my child early next thursday morn 
the gallant young and noble gentleman 
the county paris at saint peter s church 
shall happily make thee there a joyful bride 
now by saint peter s church and peter too 
he shall not make me there a joyful bride 
i wonder at this haste that i must wed
ere he that should be husband comes to woo 
i pray you tell my lord and father madam 
i will not marry yet and when i do i swear 
it shall be romeo whom you know i hate 
rather than paris these are news indeed 
here comes your father tell him so yourself 
and see how he will take it at your hands 
when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew 
but for the sunset of my brother s son
it rains downright 
how now a conduit girl what still in tears 
evermore showering in one little body
thou counterfeit st a bark a sea a wind 
for still thy eyes which i may call the sea 
do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is 
sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs 
who raging with thy tears and they with them 
without a sudden calm will overset
thy tempest-tossed body how now wife 
have you deliver d to her our decree 
ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks 
i would the fool were married to her grave 
soft take me with you take me with you wife 
how will she none doth she not give us thanks 
is she not proud doth she not count her blest 
unworthy as she is that we have wrought
so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom 
not proud you have but thankful that you have:
proud can i never be of what i hate 
but thankful even for hate that is meant love 
how now how now chop-logic what is this 
proud and i thank you and i thank you not 
and yet not proud mistress minion you 
thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds 
but fettle your fine joints gainst thursday next 
to go with paris to saint peter s church 
or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither 
out you green-sickness carrion out you baggage 
you tallow-face 
fie fie what are you mad 
good father i beseech you on my knees 
hear me with patience but to speak a word 
hang thee young baggage disobedient wretch 
i tell thee what: get thee to church o thursday 
or never after look me in the face:
speak not reply not do not answer me 
my fingers itch wife we scarce thought us blest
that god had lent us but this only child 
but now i see this one is one too much 
and that we have a curse in having her:
out on her hilding 
god in heaven bless her 
you are to blame my lord to rate her so 
and why my lady wisdom hold your tongue 
good prudence smatter with your gossips go 
i speak no treason 
o god ye god-den 
may not one speak 
peace you mumbling fool 
utter your gravity o er a gossip s bowl 
for here we need it not 
you are too hot 
god s bread it makes me mad:
day night hour tide time work play 
alone in company still my care hath been
to have her match d: and having now provided
a gentleman of noble parentage 
of fair demesnes youthful and nobly train d 
stuff d as they say with honourable parts 
proportion d as one s thought would wish a man 
and then to have a wretched puling fool 
a whining mammet in her fortune s tender 
to answer i ll not wed i cannot love 
i am too young i pray you pardon me 
but as you will not wed i ll pardon you:
graze where you will you shall not house with me:
look to t think on t i do not use to jest 
thursday is near lay hand on heart advise:
an you be mine i ll give you to my friend 
and you be not hang beg starve die in
the streets 
for by my soul i ll ne er acknowledge thee 
nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
trust to t bethink you i ll not be forsworn 
is there no pity sitting in the clouds 
that sees into the bottom of my grief 
o sweet my mother cast me not away 
delay this marriage for a month a week 
or if you do not make the bridal bed
in that dim monument where tybalt lies 
talk not to me for i ll not speak a word:
do as thou wilt for i have done with thee 
o god o nurse how shall this be prevented 
my husband is on earth my faith in heaven 
how shall that faith return again to earth 
unless that husband send it me from heaven
by leaving earth comfort me counsel me 
alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems
upon so soft a subject as myself 
what say st thou hast thou not a word of joy 
some comfort nurse 
faith here it is 
romeo is banish d and all the world to nothing 
that he dares ne er come back to challenge you 
or if he do it needs must be by stealth 
then since the case so stands as now it doth 
i think it best you married with the county 
o he s a lovely gentleman 
romeo s a dishclout to him: an eagle madam 
hath not so green so quick so fair an eye
as paris hath beshrew my very heart 
i think you are happy in this second match 
for it excels your first: or if it did not 
your first is dead or twere as good he were 
as living here and you no use of him 
speakest thou from thy heart 
and from my soul too 
or else beshrew them both 
amen 
what 
well thou hast comforted me marvellous much 
go in: and tell my lady i am gone 
having displeased my father to laurence cell 
to make confession and to be absolved 
marry i will and this is wisely done 
ancient damnation o most wicked fiend 
is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn 
or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
which she hath praised him with above compare
so many thousand times go counsellor 
thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain 
i ll to the friar to know his remedy:
if all else fail myself have power to die 
on thursday sir the time is very short 
my father capulet will have it so 
and i am nothing slow to slack his haste 
you say you do not know the lady s mind:
uneven is the course i like it not 
immoderately she weeps for tybalt s death 
and therefore have i little talk d of love 
for venus smiles not in a house of tears 
now sir her father counts it dangerous
that she doth give her sorrow so much sway 
and in his wisdom hastes our marriage 
to stop the inundation of her tears 
which too much minded by herself alone 
may be put from her by society:
now do you know the reason of this haste 
[aside] i would i knew not why it should be slow d 
look sir here comes the lady towards my cell 
happily met my lady and my wife 
that may be sir when i may be a wife 
that may be must be love on thursday next 
what must be shall be 
that s a certain text 
come you to make confession to this father 
to answer that i should confess to you 
do not deny to him that you love me 
i will confess to you that i love him 
so will ye i am sure that you love me 
if i do so it will be of more price 
being spoke behind your back than to your face 
poor soul thy face is much abused with tears 
the tears have got small victory by that 
for it was bad enough before their spite 
thou wrong st it more than tears with that report 
that is no slander sir which is a truth 
and what i spake i spake it to my face 
thy face is mine and thou hast slander d it 
it may be so for it is not mine own 
are you at leisure holy father now 
or shall i come to you at evening mass 
my leisure serves me pensive daughter now 
my lord we must entreat the time alone 
god shield i should disturb devotion 
juliet on thursday early will i rouse ye:
till then adieu and keep this holy kiss 
o shut the door and when thou hast done so 
come weep with me past hope past cure past help 
ah juliet i already know thy grief 
it strains me past the compass of my wits:
i hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it 
on thursday next be married to this county 
tell me not friar that thou hear st of this 
unless thou tell me how i may prevent it:
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help 
do thou but call my resolution wise 
and with this knife i ll help it presently 
god join d my heart and romeo s thou our hands 
and ere this hand by thee to romeo seal d 
shall be the label to another deed 
or my true heart with treacherous revolt
turn to another this shall slay them both:
therefore out of thy long-experienced time 
give me some present counsel or behold 
twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
shall play the umpire arbitrating that
which the commission of thy years and art
could to no issue of true honour bring 
be not so long to speak i long to die 
if what thou speak st speak not of remedy 
hold daughter: i do spy a kind of hope 
which craves as desperate an execution 
as that is desperate which we would prevent 
if rather than to marry county paris 
thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself 
then is it likely thou wilt undertake
a thing like death to chide away this shame 
that copest with death himself to scape from it:
and if thou darest i ll give thee remedy 
o bid me leap rather than marry paris 
from off the battlements of yonder tower 
or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
where serpents are chain me with roaring bears 
or shut me nightly in a charnel-house 
o er-cover d quite with dead men s rattling bones 
with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls 
or bid me go into a new-made grave
and hide me with a dead man in his shroud 
things that to hear them told have made me tremble 
and i will do it without fear or doubt 
to live an unstain d wife to my sweet love 
hold then go home be merry give consent
to marry paris: wednesday is to-morrow:
to-morrow night look that thou lie alone 
let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
take thou this vial being then in bed 
and this distilled liquor drink thou off 
when presently through all thy veins shall run
a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
shall keep his native progress but surcease:
no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest 
the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
to paly ashes thy eyes windows fall 
like death when he shuts up the day of life 
each part deprived of supple government 
shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death:
and in this borrow d likeness of shrunk death
thou shalt continue two and forty hours 
and then awake as from a pleasant sleep 
now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead:
then as the manner of our country is 
in thy best robes uncover d on the bier
thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
where all the kindred of the capulets lie 
in the mean time against thou shalt awake 
shall romeo by my letters know our drift 
and hither shall he come: and he and i
will watch thy waking and that very night
shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua 
and this shall free thee from this present shame 
if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear 
abate thy valour in the acting it 
give me give me o tell not me of fear 
hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
in this resolve: i ll send a friar with speed
to mantua with my letters to thy lord 
love give me strength and strength shall help afford 
farewell dear father 
so many guests invite as here are writ 
sirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooks

what is my daughter gone to friar laurence 
ay forsooth 
well he may chance to do some good on her:

see where she comes from shrift with merry look 
how now my headstrong where have you been gadding 
where i have learn d me to repent the sin
of disobedient opposition
to you and your behests and am enjoin d
by holy laurence to fall prostrate here 
and beg your pardon: pardon i beseech you 
henceforward i am ever ruled by you 
send for the county go tell him of this:
i ll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning 
i met the youthful lord at laurence cell 
and gave him what becomed love i might 
not step o er the bounds of modesty 
why i am glad on t this is well: stand up:
this is as t should be let me see the county 
ay marry go i say and fetch him hither 
now afore god this reverend holy friar 
our whole city is much bound to him 
male will you go with me into my closet 
to help me sort such needful ornaments
as you think fit to furnish me to-morrow

go nurse go with her: we ll to church to-morrow 
we shall be short in our provision:

tush i will stir about 
and all things shall be well i warrant thee wife:
go thou to juliet help to deck up her 
i ll not to bed to-night let me alone 
i ll play the housewife for this once what ho 
they are all forth well i will walk myself
to county paris to prepare him up
against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light 
since this same wayward girl is so reclaim d 
ay those attires are best: but gentle male 
i pray thee leave me to my self to-night 
for i have need of many orisons
to move the heavens to smile upon my state 
which well thou know st is cross and full of sin 
what are you busy ho need you my help 
no madam we have cull d such necessaries
as are behoveful for our state to-morrow:

my dismal scene i needs must act alone 
come vial 
what if this mixture do not work at all 
shall i be married then to-morrow morning 
no no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there 
laying down her dagger
what if it be a poison which the friar
subtly hath minister d to have me dead 
lest in this marriage he should be dishonour d 
because he married me before to romeo 
i fear it is: and yet methinks it should not 
for he hath still been tried a holy man 
how if when i am laid into the tomb 
i wake before the time that romeo
come to redeem me there s a fearful point 
shall i not then be stifled in the vault 
to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in 
and there die strangled ere my romeo comes 
or if i live is it not very like 
the horrible conceit of death and night 
together with the terror of the place 
as in a vault an ancient receptacle 
where for these many hundred years the bones
of all my buried ancestors are packed:
where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth 
lies festering in his shroud where as they say 
at some hours in the night spirits resort 
alack alack is it not like that i 
so early waking what with loathsome smells 
and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth 
that living mortals hearing them run mad: 
o if i wake shall i not be distraught 
environed with all these hideous fears 
and madly play with my forefather s joints 
and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud 
and in this rage with some great kinsman s bone 
as with a club dash out my desperate brains 
o look methinks i see my cousin s ghost
seeking out romeo that did spit his body
upon a rapier s point: stay tybalt stay 
romeo i come this do i drink to thee 
hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse 
they call for dates and quinces in the pastry 
come stir stir stir the second cock hath crow d 
the curfew-bell hath rung tis three o clock:
look to the baked meats good angelica:
spare not for the cost 
go you cot-quean go 
get you to bed faith you ll be sick to-morrow
for this night s watching

alack the day she s dead she s dead she s dead 
ha let me see her: out alas she s cold:
her blood is settled and her joints are stiff 
life and these lips have long been separated:
death lies on her like an untimely frost
upon the sweetest flower of all the field 
o lamentable day 
o woful time 
death that hath ta en her hence to make me wail 
ties up my tongue and will not let me speak 
come is the bride ready to go to church 
ready to go but never to return 
o son the night before thy wedding-day
hath death lain with thy wife there she lies 
flower as she was deflowered by him 
death is my son-in-law death is my heir 
my daughter he hath wedded: i will die 
and leave him all life living all is death s 
have i thought long to see this morning s face 
and doth it give me such a sight as this 
accursed unhappy wretched hateful day 
most miserable hour that e er time saw
in lasting labour of his pilgrimage 
but one poor one one poor and loving child 
but one thing to rejoice and solace in 
and cruel death hath catch d it from my sight 
o woe o woful woful woful day 
most lamentable day most woful day 
that ever ever i did yet behold 
o day o day o day o hateful day 
never was seen so black a day as this:
o woful day o woful day 
beguiled divorced wronged spited slain 
most detestable death by thee beguil d 
by cruel cruel thee quite overthrown 
o love o life not life but love in death 
despised distressed hated martyr d kill d 
uncomfortable time why camest thou now
to murder murder our solemnity 
o child o child my soul and not my child 
dead art thou alack my child is dead 
and with my child my joys are buried 
peace ho for shame confusion s cure lives not
in these confusions heaven and yourself
had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all 
and all the better is it for the maid:
your part in her you could not keep from death 
but heaven keeps his part in eternal life 
the most you sought was her promotion 
for twas your heaven she should be advanced:
and weep ye now seeing she is advanced
above the clouds as high as heaven itself 
o in this love you love your child so ill 
that you run mad seeing that she is well:
she s not well married that lives married long 
but she s best married that dies married young 
dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
on this fair corse and as the custom is 
in all her best array bear her to church:
for though fond nature bids us an lament 
yet nature s tears are reason s merriment 
all things that we ordained festival 
turn from their office to black funeral 
our instruments to melancholy bells 
our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast 
our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change 
our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse 
and all things change them to the contrary 
sir go you in and madam go with him 
and go sir paris every one prepare
to follow this fair corse unto her grave:
the heavens do lour upon you for some ill 
move them no more by crossing their high will

hang him jack come we ll in here tarry for the
mourners and stay dinner 
if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep 
my dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
my bosom s lord sits lightly in his throne 
and all this day an unaccustom d spirit
lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts 
i dreamt my lady came and found me dead 
strange dream that gives a dead man leave
to think 
and breathed such life with kisses in my lips 
that i revived and was an emperor 
ah me how sweet is love itself possess d 
when but love s shadows are so rich in joy 
news from verona how now balthasar 
dost thou not bring me letters from the friar 
how doth my lady is my father well 
how fares my juliet that i ask again 
for nothing can be ill if she be well 
then she is well and nothing can be ill:
her body sleeps in capel s monument 
and her immortal part with angels lives 
i saw her laid low in her kindred s vault 
and presently took post to tell it you:
o pardon me for bringing these ill news 
since you did leave it for my office sir 
is it even so then i defy you stars 
thou know st my lodging: get me ink and paper 
and hire post-horses i will hence to-night 
i do beseech you sir have patience:
your looks are pale and wild and do import
some misadventure 
tush thou art deceived:
leave me and do the thing i bid thee do 
hast thou no letters to me from the friar 
no my good lord 
no matter: get thee gone 
and hire those horses i ll be with thee straight 
well juliet i will lie with thee to-night 
let s see for means: o mischief thou art swift
to enter in the thoughts of desperate men 
i do remember an apothecary 
and hereabouts he dwells which late i noted
in tatter d weeds with overwhelming brows 
culling of simples meagre were his looks 
sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
and in his needy shop a tortoise hung 
an alligator stuff d and other skins
of ill-shaped fishes and about his shelves
a beggarly account of empty boxes 
green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds 
remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses 
were thinly scatter d to make up a show 
noting this penury to myself i said
an if a man did need a poison now 
whose sale is present death in mantua 
here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him 
o this same thought did but forerun my need 
and this same needy man must sell it me 
as i remember this should be the house 
being holiday the beggar s shop is shut 
what ho apothecary 
who calls so loud 
come hither man i see that thou art poor:
hold there is forty ducats: let me have
a dram of poison such soon-speeding gear
as will disperse itself through all the veins
that the life-weary taker may fall dead
and that the trunk may be discharged of breath
as violently as hasty powder fired
doth hurry from the fatal cannon s womb 
such mortal drugs i have but mantua s law
is death to any he that utters them 
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness 
and fear st to die famine is in thy cheeks 
need and oppression starveth in thine eyes 
contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back 
the world is not thy friend nor the world s law 
the world affords no law to make thee rich 
then be not poor but break it and take this 
my poverty but not my will consents 
i pay thy poverty and not thy will 
put this in any liquid thing you will 
and drink it off and if you had the strength
of twenty men it would dispatch you straight 
there is thy gold worse poison to men s souls 
doing more murders in this loathsome world 
than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell 
i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none 
farewell: buy food and get thyself in flesh 
come cordial and not poison go with me
to juliet s grave for there must i use thee 
holy franciscan friar brother ho 
this same should be the voice of friar john 
welcome from mantua: what says romeo 
or if his mind be writ give me his letter 
going to find a bare-foot brother out
one of our order to associate me 
here in this city visiting the sick 
and finding him the searchers of the town 
suspecting that we both were in a house
where the infectious pestilence did reign 
seal d up the doors and would not let us forth 
so that my speed to mantua there was stay d 
who bare my letter then to romeo 
i could not send it here it is again 
nor get a messenger to bring it thee 
so fearful were they of infection 
unhappy fortune by my brotherhood 
the letter was not nice but full of charge
of dear import and the neglecting it
may do much danger friar john go hence 
get me an iron crow and bring it straight
unto my cell 
brother i ll go and bring it thee 
now must i to the monument alone 
within three hours will fair juliet wake:
she will beshrew me much that romeo
hath had no notice of these accidents 
but i will write again to mantua 
and keep her at my cell till romeo come 
poor living corse closed in a dead man s tomb 
give me thy torch boy: hence and stand aloof:
yet put it out for i would not be seen 
under yond yew-trees lay thee all along 
holding thine ear close to the hollow ground 
so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread 
being loose unfirm with digging up of graves 
but thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me 
as signal that thou hear st something approach 
give me those flowers do as i bid thee go 
page
[aside] i am almost afraid to stand alone
here in the churchyard yet i will adventure 
retires
sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed i strew 
o woe thy canopy is dust and stones 
which with sweet water nightly i will dew 
or wanting that with tears distill d by moans:
the obsequies that i for thee will keep
nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep 
the boy gives warning something doth approach 
what cursed foot wanders this way to-night 
to cross my obsequies and true love s rite 
what with a torch muffle me night awhile 
give me that mattock and the wrenching iron 
hold take this letter early in the morning
see thou deliver it to my lord and father 
give me the light: upon thy life i charge thee 
whate er thou hear st or seest stand all aloof 
and do not interrupt me in my course 
why i descend into this bed of death 
is partly to behold my lady s face 
but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
a precious ring a ring that i must use
in dear employment: therefore hence be gone:
but if thou jealous dost return to pry
in what i further shall intend to do 
by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint
and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
the time and my intents are savage-wild 
more fierce and more inexorable far
than empty tigers or the roaring sea 
i will be gone sir and not trouble you 
so shalt thou show me friendship take thou that:
live and be prosperous: and farewell good fellow 
[aside] for all this same i ll hide me hereabout:
his looks i fear and his intents i doubt 
retires
thou detestable maw thou womb of death 
gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth 
thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open 
and in despite i ll cram thee with more food 
opens the tomb
this is that banish d haughty montague 
that murder d my love s cousin with which grief 
it is supposed the fair creature died 
and here is come to do some villanous shame
to the dead bodies: i will apprehend him 
comes forward
stop thy unhallow d toil vile montague 
can vengeance be pursued further than death 
condemned villain i do apprehend thee:
obey and go with me for thou must die 
i must indeed and therefore came i hither 
good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man 
fly hence and leave me: think upon these gone 
let them affright thee i beseech thee youth 
put not another sin upon my head 
by urging me to fury: o be gone 
by heaven i love thee better than myself 
for i come hither arm d against myself:
stay not be gone live and hereafter say 
a madman s mercy bade thee run away 
i do defy thy conjurations 
and apprehend thee for a felon here 
wilt thou provoke me then have at thee boy

o lord they fight i will go call the watch 
o i am slain 
if thou be merciful 
open the tomb lay me with juliet 
in faith i will let me peruse this face 
mercutio s kinsman noble county paris 
what said my man when my betossed soul
did not attend him as we rode i think
he told me paris should have married juliet:
said he not so or did i dream it so 
or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet 
to think it was so o give me thy hand 
one writ with me in sour misfortune s book 
i ll bury thee in a triumphant grave 
a grave o no a lantern slaughter d youth 
for here lies juliet and her beauty makes
this vault a feasting presence full of light 
death lie thou there by a dead man interr d 
laying male in the tomb
how oft when men are at the point of death
have they been merry which their keepers call
a lightning before death: o how may i
call this a lightning o my love my wife 
death that hath suck d the honey of thy breath 
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
thou art not conquer d beauty s ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks 
and death s pale flag is not advanced there 
tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet 
o what more favour can i do to thee 
than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
to sunder his that was thine enemy 
forgive me cousin ah dear juliet 
why art thou yet so fair shall i believe
that unsubstantial death is amorous 
and that the lean abhorred monster keeps
thee here in dark to be his paramour 
for fear of that i still will stay with thee 
and never from this palace of dim night
depart again: here here will i remain
with worms that are thy chamber-maids o here
will i set up my everlasting rest 
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh eyes look your last 
arms take your last embrace and lips o you
the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
a dateless bargain to engrossing death 
come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide 
thou desperate pilot now at once run on
the dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark 
here s to my love 
o true apothecary 
thy drugs are quick thus with a kiss i die 
saint francis be my speed how oft to-night
have my old feet stumbled at graves who s there 
here s one a friend and one that knows you well 
bliss be upon you tell me good my friend 
what torch is yond that vainly lends his light
to grubs and eyeless skulls as i discern 
it burneth in the capel s monument 
it doth so holy sir and there s my master 
one that you love 
who is it 
romeo 
how long hath he been there 
full half an hour 
go with me to the vault 
i dare not sir
my master knows not but i am gone hence 
and fearfully did menace me with death 
if i did stay to look on his intents 
stay then i ll go alone fear comes upon me:
o much i fear some ill unlucky thing 
as i did sleep under this yew-tree here 
i dreamt my master and another fought 
and that my master slew him 
romeo 
advances
alack alack what blood is this which stains
the stony entrance of this sepulchre 
what mean these masterless and gory swords
to lie discolour d by this place of peace 
romeo o pale who else what paris too 
and steep d in blood ah what an unkind hour
is guilty of this lamentable chance 
the lady stirs 
o comfortable friar where is my lord 
i do remember well where i should be 
and there i am where is my romeo 
noise within
i hear some noise lady come from that nest
of death contagion and unnatural sleep:
a greater power than we can contradict
hath thwarted our intents come come away 
thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead 
and paris too come i ll dispose of thee
among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
stay not to question for the watch is coming 
come go good juliet 
i dare no longer stay 
go get thee hence for i will not away 
what s here a cup closed in my true love s hand 
poison i see hath been his timeless end:
o churl drunk all and left no friendly drop
to help me after i will kiss thy lips 
haply some poison yet doth hang on them 
to make die with a restorative 
kisses him

this is the place there where the torch doth burn 
first watchman
the ground is bloody search about the churchyard:
go some of you whoe er you find attach 
pitiful sight here lies the county slain 
and juliet bleeding warm and newly dead 
who here hath lain these two days buried 
go tell the prince: run to the capulets:
raise up the montagues: some others search:
we see the ground whereon these woes do lie 
but the true ground of all these piteous woes
we cannot without circumstance descry 
second watchman
here s romeo s man we found him in the churchyard 
first watchman
hold him in safety till the prince come hither 
third watchman
here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps:
we took this mattock and this spade from him 
as he was coming from this churchyard side 
first watchman
a great suspicion: stay the friar too 
what misadventure is so early up 
that calls our person from our morning s rest 
what should it be that they so shriek abroad 
the people in the street cry romeo 
some juliet and some paris and all run 
with open outcry toward our monument 
what fear is this which startles in our ears 
first watchman
sovereign here lies the county paris slain 
and romeo dead and juliet dead before 
warm and new kill d 
search seek and know how this foul murder comes 
first watchman
here is a friar and slaughter d romeo s man 
with instruments upon them fit to open
these dead men s tombs 
o heavens o wife look how our daughter bleeds 
this dagger hath mista en for lo his house
is empty on the back of montague 
and it mis-sheathed in my daughter s bosom 
o me this sight of death is as a bell 
that warns my old age to a sepulchre 
come montague for thou art early up 
to see thy son and heir more early down 
alas my liege my wife is dead to-night 
grief of my son s exile hath stopp d her breath:
what further woe conspires against mine age 
look and thou shalt see 
o thou untaught what manners is in this 
to press before thy father to a grave 
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while 
till we can clear these ambiguities 
and know their spring their head their
true descent 
and then will i be general of your woes 
and lead you even to death: meantime forbear 
and let mischance be slave to patience 
bring forth the parties of suspicion 
i am the greatest able to do least 
yet most suspected as the time and place
doth make against me of this direful murder 
and here i stand both to impeach and purge
myself condemned and myself excused 
then say at once what thou dost know in this 
i will be brief for my short date of breath
is not so long as is a tedious tale 
romeo there dead was husband to that juliet 
and she there dead that romeo s faithful wife:
i married them and their stol n marriage-day
was tybalt s dooms-day whose untimely death
banish d the new-made bridegroom from the city 
for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined 
you to remove that siege of grief from her 
betroth d and would have married her perforce
to county paris: then comes she to me 
and with wild looks bid me devise some mean
to rid her from this second marriage 
or in my cell there would she kill herself 
then gave i her so tutor d by my art 
a sleeping potion which so took effect
as i intended for it wrought on her
the form of death: meantime i writ to romeo 
that he should hither come as this dire night 
to help to take her from her borrow d grave 
being the time the potion s force should cease 
but he which bore my letter friar john 
was stay d by accident and yesternight
return d my letter back then all alone
at the prefixed hour of her waking 
came i to take her from her kindred s vault 
meaning to keep her closely at my cell 
till i conveniently could send to romeo:
but when i came some minute ere the time
of her awaking here untimely lay
the noble paris and true romeo dead 
she wakes and i entreated her come forth 
and bear this work of heaven with patience:
but then a noise did scare me from the tomb 
and she too desperate would not go with me 
but as it seems did violence on herself 
all this i know and to the marriage
her nurse is privy: and if aught in this
miscarried by my fault let my old life
be sacrificed some hour before his time 
unto the rigour of severest law 
we still have known thee for a holy man 
where s romeo s man what can he say in this 
i brought my master news of juliet s death 
and then in post he came from mantua
to this same place to this same monument 
this letter he early bid me give his father 
and threatened me with death going in the vault 
i departed not and left him there 
give me the letter i will look on it 
where is the county s page that raised the watch 
sirrah what made your master in this place 
page
he came with flowers to strew his lady s grave 
and bid me stand aloof and so i did:
anon comes one with light to ope the tomb 
and by and by my master drew on him 
and then i ran away to call the watch 
this letter doth make good the friar s words 
their course of love the tidings of her death:
and here he writes that he did buy a poison
of a poor pothecary and therewithal
came to this vault to die and lie with juliet 
where be these enemies capulet montague 
see what a scourge is laid upon your hate 
that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love 
and i for winking at your discords too
have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish d 
o brother montague give me thy hand:
this is my daughter s jointure for no more
can i demand 
but i can give thee more:
for i will raise her statue in pure gold 
that while verona by that name is known 
there shall no figure at such rate be set
as that of true and faithful juliet 
as rich shall romeo s by his lady s lie 
poor sacrifices of our enmity 
a glooming peace this morning with it brings 
the sun for sorrow will not show his head:
go hence to have more talk of these sad things 
some shall be pardon d and some punished:
for never was a story of more woe
than this of juliet and her romeo 
i ll pheeze you in faith 
ye are a baggage: the slys are no rogues look in
the chronicles we came in with richard conqueror 
therefore paucas pallabris let the world slide: sessa 
no not a denier go by jeronimy: go to thy cold
bed and warm thee 
third or fourth or fifth borough i ll answer him
by law: i ll not budge an inch boy: let him come 
and kindly 
falls asleep
huntsman i charge thee tender well my hounds:
brach merriman the poor cur is emboss d 
and couple clowder with the deep mouth d brach 
saw st thou not boy how silver made it good
at the hedge-corner in the coldest fault 
i would not lose the dog for twenty pound 
why belman is as good as he my lord 
he cried upon it at the merest loss
and twice to-day pick d out the dullest scent:
trust me i take him for the better dog 
thou art a fool: if echo were as fleet 
i would esteem him worth a dozen such 
but sup them well and look unto them all:
to-morrow i intend to hunt again 
i will my lord 
what s here one dead or drunk see doth he breathe 
second huntsman
he breathes my lord were he not warm d with ale 
this were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly 
o monstrous beast how like a swine he lies 
grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image 
sirs i will practise on this drunken man 
what think you if he were convey d to bed 
wrapp d in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers 
a most delicious banquet by his bed 
and brave attendants near him when he wakes 
would not the beggar then forget himself 
believe me lord i think he cannot choose 
second huntsman
it would seem strange unto him when he waked 
even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy 
then take him up and manage well the jest:
carry him gently to my fairest chamber
and hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
and burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
procure me music ready when he wakes 
to make a dulcet and a heavenly sound 
and if he chance to speak be ready straight
and with a low submissive reverence
say what is it your honour will command 
let one attend him with a silver basin
full of rose-water and bestrew d with flowers 
another bear the ewer the third a diaper 
and say will t please your lordship cool your hands 
some one be ready with a costly suit
and ask him what apparel he will wear 
another tell him of his hounds and horse 
and that his lady mourns at his disease:
persuade him that he hath been lunatic 
and when he says he is say that he dreams 
for he is nothing but a mighty lord 
this do and do it kindly gentle sirs:
it will be pastime passing excellent 
if it be husbanded with modesty 
my lord i warrant you we will play our part 
as he shall think by our true diligence
he is no less than what we say he is 
take him up gently and to bed with him 
and each one to his office when he wakes 
some bear out male a trumpet sounds
sirrah go see what trumpet tis that sounds:
belike some noble gentleman that means 
travelling some journey to repose him here 
how now who is it 
servant
an t please your honour players
that offer service to your lordship 
now fellows you are welcome 
do you intend to stay with me tonight 
mlae
so please your lordship to accept our duty 
with all my heart this fellow i remember 
since once he play d a farmer s eldest son:
twas where you woo d the gentlewoman so well:
i have forgot your name but sure that part
was aptly fitted and naturally perform d 
i think twas soto that your honour means 
tis very true: thou didst it excellent 
well you are come to me in a happy time 
the rather for i have some sport in hand
wherein your cunning can assist me much 
there is a lord will hear you play to-night:
but i am doubtful of your modesties 
lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior 
for yet his honour never heard a play 
you break into some merry passion
and so offend him for i tell you sirs 
if you should smile he grows impatient 
fear not my lord: we can contain ourselves 
were he the veriest antic in the world 
go sirrah take them to the buttery 
and give them friendly welcome every one:
let them want nothing that my house affords 
sirrah go you to barthol mew my page 
and see him dress d in all suits like a lady:
that done conduct him to the drunkard s chamber 
and call him madam do him obeisance 
tell him from me as he will win my love 
he bear himself with honourable action 
such as he hath observed in noble ladies
unto their lords by them accomplished:
such duty to the drunkard let him do
with soft low tongue and lowly courtesy 
and say what is t your honour will command 
wherein your lady and your humble wife
may show her duty and make known her love 
and then with kind embracements tempting kisses 
and with declining head into his bosom 
bid him shed tears as being overjoy d
to see her noble lord restored to health 
who for this seven years hath esteem d him
no better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
and if the boy have not a woman s gift
to rain a shower of commanded tears 
an onion will do well for such a shift 
which in a napkin being close convey d
shall in despite enforce a watery eye 
see this dispatch d with all the haste thou canst:
anon i ll give thee more instructions 
i know the boy will well usurp the grace 
voice gait and action of a gentlewoman:
i long to hear him call the drunkard husband 
and how my men will stay themselves from laughter
when they do homage to this simple peasant 
i ll in to counsel them haply my presence
may well abate the over-merry spleen
which otherwise would grow into extremes 
for god s sake a pot of small ale 
will t please your lordship drink a cup of sack 
will t please your honour taste of these conserves 
what raiment will your honour wear to-day 
i am christophero sly call not me honour nor
lordship: i ne er drank sack in my life and if
you give me any conserves give me conserves of
beef: ne er ask me what raiment i ll wear for i
have no more doublets than backs no more stockings
than legs nor no more shoes than feet nay 
sometimes more feet than shoes or such shoes as my
toes look through the over-leather 
heaven cease this idle humour in your honour 
o that a mighty man of such descent 
of such possessions and so high esteem 
should be infused with so foul a spirit 
what would you make me mad am not i christopher
sly old sly s son of burtonheath by birth a
pedlar by education a cardmaker by transmutation a
bear-herd and now by present profession a tinker 
ask marian hacket the fat ale-wife of wincot if
she know me not: if she say i am not fourteen pence
on the score for sheer ale score me up for the
lyingest knave in christendom what i am not
bestraught: here s 
o this it is that makes your lady mourn 
o this is it that makes your servants droop 
hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house 
as beaten hence by your strange lunacy 
o noble lord bethink thee of thy birth 
call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
and banish hence these abject lowly dreams 
look how thy servants do attend on thee 
each in his office ready at thy beck 
wilt thou have music hark apollo plays 
music
and twenty caged nightingales do sing:
or wilt thou sleep we ll have thee to a couch
softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
on purpose trimm d up for semiramis 
say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground:
or wilt thou ride thy horses shall be trapp d 
their harness studded all with gold and pearl 
dost thou love hawking thou hast hawks will soar
above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt 
thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
and fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth 
say thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swift
as breathed stags ay fleeter than the roe 
dost thou love pictures we will fetch thee straight
adonis painted by a running brook 
and cytherea all in sedges hid 
which seem to move and wanton with her breath 
even as the waving sedges play with wind 
we ll show thee io as she was a maid 
and how she was beguiled and surprised 
as lively painted as the deed was done 
or daphne roaming through a thorny wood 
scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds 
and at that sight shall sad apollo weep 
so workmanly the blood and tears are drawn 
thou art a lord and nothing but a lord:
thou hast a lady far more beautiful
than any woman in this waning age 
and till the tears that she hath shed for thee
like envious floods o er-run her lovely face 
she was the fairest creature in the world 
and yet she is inferior to none 
am i a lord and have i such a lady 
or do i dream or have i dream d till now 
i do not sleep: i see i hear i speak 
i smell sweet savours and i feel soft things:
upon my life i am a lord indeed
and not a tinker nor christophero sly 
well bring our lady hither to our sight 
and once again a pot o the smallest ale 
will t please your mightiness to wash your hands 
o how we joy to see your wit restored 
o that once more you knew but what you are 
these fifteen years you have been in a dream 
or when you waked so waked as if you slept 
these fifteen years by my fay a goodly nap 
but did i never speak of all that time 
o yes my lord but very idle words:
for though you lay here in this goodly chamber 
yet would you say ye were beaten out of door 
and rail upon the hostess of the house 
and say you would present her at the leet 
because she brought stone jugs and no seal d quarts:
sometimes you would call out for cicely hacket 
ay the woman s maid of the house 
why sir you know no house nor no such maid 
nor no such men as you have reckon d up 
as stephen sly and did john naps of greece
and peter turph and henry pimpernell
and twenty more such names and men as these
which never were nor no man ever saw 
now lord be thanked for my good amends 
all
amen 
i thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it

how fares my noble lord 
marry i fare well for here is cheer enough 
where is my wife

here noble lord: what is thy will with her 
are you my wife and will not call me husband 
my men should call me lord: i am your goodman

my husband and my lord my lord and husband 
i am your wife in all obedience

being all this time abandon d from your bed 
tis much servants leave me and her alone 
madam undress you and come now to bed 
page
thrice noble lord let me entreat of you
to pardon me yet for a night or two 
or if not so until the sun be set:
for your physicians have expressly charged 
in peril to incur your former malady 
that i should yet absent me from your bed:
i hope this reason stands for my excuse 
ay it stands so that i may hardly
tarry so long but i would be loath to fall into
my dreams again: i will therefore tarry in
despite of the flesh and the blood 
messenger
your honour s players heating your amendment 
are come to play a pleasant comedy 
for so your doctors hold it very meet 
seeing too much sadness hath congeal d your blood 
and melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
therefore they thought it good you hear a play
and frame your mind to mirth and merriment 
which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life 
marry i will let them play it is not a
comondy a christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick 
page
no my good lord it is more pleasing stuff 
what household stuff 
page
it is a kind of history 
well well see t come madam wife sit by my side
and let the world slip: we shall ne er be younger 
flourish
tranio since for the great desire i had
to see fair padua nursery of arts 
i am arrived for fruitful lombardy 
the pleasant garden of great italy 
and by my father s love and leave am arm d
with his good will and thy good company 
my trusty servant well approved in all 
here let us breathe and haply institute
a course of learning and ingenious studies 
pisa renown d for grave citizens
gave me my being and my father first 
a merchant of great traffic through the world 
vincetino come of bentivolii 
vincetino s son brought up in florence
it shall become to serve all hopes conceived 
to deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
and therefore tranio for the time i study 
virtue and that part of philosophy
will i apply that treats of happiness
by virtue specially to be achieved 
tell me thy mind for i have pisa left
and am to padua come as he that leaves
a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst 
mi perdonato gentle master mine 
i am in all affected as yourself 
glad that you thus continue your resolve
to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy 
only good master while we do admire
this virtue and this moral discipline 
let s be no stoics nor no stocks i pray 
or so devote to aristotle s cheques
as ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
balk logic with acquaintance that you have
and practise rhetoric in your common talk 
music and poesy use to quicken you 
the mathematics and the metaphysics 
fall to them as you find your stomach serves you 
no profit grows where is no pleasure ta en:
in brief sir study what you most affect 
gramercies tranio well dost thou advise 
if biondello thou wert come ashore 
we could at once put us in readiness 
and take a lodging fit to entertain
such friends as time in padua shall beget 
but stay a while: what company is this 
master some show to welcome us to town 
gentlemen importune me no farther 
for how i firmly am resolved you know 
that is not bestow my youngest daughter
before i have a husband for the elder:
if either of you both love katharina 
because i know you well and love you well 
leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure 
[aside] to cart her rather: she s too rough for me 
there there hortensio will you any wife 
mates maid how mean you that no mates for you 
unless you were of gentler milder mould 
from all such devils good lord deliver us 
and me too good lord 
hush master here s some good pastime toward:
that wench is stark mad or wonderful froward 
but in the other s silence do i see
maid s mild behavior and sobriety 
peace tranio 
well said master mum and gaze your fill 
gentlemen that i may soon make good
what i have said bianca get you in:
and let it not displease thee good bianca 
for i will love thee ne er the less my girl 
hark tranio thou may st hear minerva speak 
signior baptista will you be so strange 
sorry am i that our good will effects
bianca s grief 
why will you mew her up 
signior baptista for this fiend of hell 
and make her bear the penance of her tongue 
gentlemen content ye i am resolved:
go in bianca:
and for i know she taketh most delight
in music instruments and poetry 
schoolmasters will i keep within my house 
fit to instruct her youth if you hortensio 
or signior gremio you know any such 
prefer them hither for to cunning men
i will be very kind and liberal
to mine own children in good bringing up:
and so farewell katharina you may stay 
for i have more to commune with bianca 
you may go to the devil s dam: your gifts are so
good here s none will hold you their love is not
so great hortensio but we may blow our nails
together and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
both sides farewell: yet for the love i bear my
sweet bianca if i can by any means light on a fit
man to teach her that wherein she delights i will
wish him to her father 
so will i signior gremio: but a word i pray 
though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both 
that we may yet again have access to our fair
mistress and be happy rivals in bianco s love to
labour and effect one thing specially 
what s that i pray 
marry sir to get a husband for her sister 
a husband a devil 
i say a husband 
i say a devil thinkest thou hortensio though
her father be very rich any man is so very a fool
to be married to hell 
tush gremio though it pass your patience and mine
to endure her loud alarums why man there be good
fellows in the world an a man could light on them 
would take her with all faults and money enough 
i cannot tell but i had as lief take her dowry with
this condition to be whipped at the high cross
every morning 
faith as you say there s small choice in rotten
apples but come since this bar in law makes us
friends it shall be so far forth friendly
maintained all by helping baptista s eldest daughter
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband 
and then have to t a fresh sweet bianca happy man
be his dole he that runs fastest gets the ring 
how say you signior gremio 
i am agreed and would i had given him the best
horse in padua to begin his wooing that would
thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the
house of her come on 
i pray sir tell me is it possible
that love should of a sudden take such hold 
o tranio till i found it to be true 
i never thought it possible or likely 
but see while idly i stood looking on 
i found the effect of love in idleness:
and now in plainness do confess to thee 
that art to me as secret and as dear
as anna to the queen of carthage was 
tranio i burn i pine i perish tranio 
if i achieve not this young modest girl 
counsel me tranio for i know thou canst 
assist me tranio for i know thou wilt 
master it is no time to chide you now 
affection is not rated from the heart:
if love have touch d you nought remains but so 
redime te captum quam queas minimo 
gramercies lad go forward this contents:
the rest will comfort for thy counsel s sound 
master you look d so longly on the maid 
perhaps you mark d not what s the pith of all 
o yes i saw sweet beauty in her face 
such as the daughter of agenor had 
that made great jove to humble him to her hand 
when with his knees he kiss d the cretan strand 
saw you no more mark d you not how her sister
began to scold and raise up such a storm
that mortal ears might hardly endure the din 
tranio i saw her coral lips to move
and with her breath she did perfume the air:
sacred and sweet was all i saw in her 
nay then tis time to stir him from his trance 
i pray awake sir: if you love the maid 
bend thoughts and wits to achieve her thus it stands:
her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
that till the father rid his hands of her 
master your love must live a maid at home 
and therefore has he closely mew d her up 
because she will not be annoy d with suitors 
ah tranio what a cruel father s he 
but art thou not advised he took some care
to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her 
ay marry am i sir and now tis plotted 
i have it tranio 
master for my hand 
both our inventions meet and jump in one 
tell me thine first 
you will be schoolmaster
and undertake the teaching of the maid:
that s your device 
it is: may it be done 
not possible for who shall bear your part 
and be in padua here vincentio s son 
keep house and ply his book welcome his friends 
visit his countrymen and banquet them 
basta content thee for i have it full 
we have not yet been seen in any house 
nor can we lie distinguish d by our faces
for man or master then it follows thus 
thou shalt be master tranio in my stead 
keep house and port and servants as i should:
i will some other be some florentine 
some neapolitan or meaner man of pisa 
tis hatch d and shall be so: tranio at once
uncase thee take my colour d hat and cloak:
when biondello comes he waits on thee 
but i will charm him first to keep his tongue 
so had you need 
in brief sir sith it your pleasure is 
and i am tied to be obedient 
for so your father charged me at our parting 
be serviceable to my son quoth he 
although i think twas in another sense 
i am content to be lucentio 
because so well i love lucentio 
tranio be so because lucentio loves:
and let me be a slave to achieve that maid
whose sudden sight hath thrall d my wounded eye 
here comes the rogue 
sirrah where have you been 
where have i been nay how now where are you 
master has my fellow tranio stolen your clothes or
you stolen his or both pray what s the news 
sirrah come hither: tis no time to jest 
and therefore frame your manners to the time 
your fellow tranio here to save my life 
puts my apparel and my countenance on 
and i for my escape have put on his 
for in a quarrel since i came ashore
i kill d a man and fear i was descried:
wait you on him i charge you as becomes 
while i make way from hence to save my life:
you understand me 
i sir ne er a whit 
and not a jot of tranio in your mouth:
tranio is changed into lucentio 
the better for him: would i were so too 
so could i faith boy to have the next wish after 
that lucentio indeed had baptista s youngest daughter 
but sirrah not for my sake but your master s i advise
you use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
when i am alone why then i am tranio 
but in all places else your master lucentio 
tranio let s go: one thing more rests that
thyself execute to make one among these wooers: if
thou ask me why sufficeth my reasons are both good
and weighty 
the presenters above speak
my lord you nod you do not mind the play 
yes by saint anne do i a good matter surely:
comes there any more of it 
page
my lord tis but begun 
tis a very excellent piece of work madam lady:
would twere done 
they sit and mark
verona for a while i take my leave 
to see my friends in padua but of all
my best beloved and approved friend 
hortensio and i trow this is his house 
here sirrah grumio knock i say 
knock sir whom should i knock is there man has
rebused your worship 
villain i say knock me here soundly 
knock you here sir why sir what am i sir that
i should knock you here sir 
villain i say knock me at this gate
and rap me well or i ll knock your knave s pate 
my master is grown quarrelsome i should knock
you first 
and then i know after who comes by the worst 
will it not be 
faith sirrah an you ll not knock i ll ring it 
i ll try how you can sol fa and sing it 
he wrings him by the ears
help masters help my master is mad 
now knock when i bid you sirrah villain 
how now what s the matter my old friend grumio 
and my good friend petruchio how do you all at verona 
signior hortensio come you to part the fray 
con tutto il cuore ben trovato may i say 
alla nostra casa ben venuto molto honorato signor
mio petruchio rise grumio rise: we will compound
this quarrel 
nay tis no matter sir what he leges in latin 
if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
service look you sir he bid me knock him and rap
him soundly sir: well was it fit for a servant to
use his master so being perhaps for aught i see 
two and thirty a pip out whom would to god i had
well knock d at first then had not grumio come by the worst 
a senseless villain good hortensio 
i bade the rascal knock upon your gate
and could not get him for my heart to do it 
knock at the gate o heavens spake you not these
words plain sirrah knock me here rap me here 
knock me well and knock me soundly and come you
now with knocking at the gate 
sirrah be gone or talk not i advise you 
petruchio patience i am grumio s pledge:
why this s a heavy chance twixt him and you 
your ancient trusty pleasant servant grumio 
and tell me now sweet friend what happy gale
blows you to padua here from old verona 
such wind as scatters young men through the world 
to seek their fortunes farther than at home
where small experience grows but in a few 
signior hortensio thus it stands with me:
antonio my father is deceased 
and i have thrust myself into this maze 
haply to wive and thrive as best i may:
crowns in my purse i have and goods at home 
and so am come abroad to see the world 
petruchio shall i then come roundly to thee
and wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour d wife 
thou ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
and yet i ll promise thee she shall be rich
and very rich: but thou rt too much my friend 
and i ll not wish thee to her 
signior hortensio twixt such friends as we
few words suffice and therefore if thou know
one rich enough to be petruchio s wife 
as wealth is burden of my wooing dance 
be she as foul as was florentius love 
as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd
as socrates xanthippe or a worse 
she moves me not or not removes at least 
affection s edge in me were she as rough
as are the swelling adriatic seas:
i come to wive it wealthily in padua 
if wealthily then happily in padua 
nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his
mind is: why give him gold enough and marry him to
a puppet or an aglet-baby or an old trot with ne er
a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases
as two and fifty horses: why nothing comes amiss 
so money comes withal 
petruchio since we are stepp d thus far in 
i will continue that i broach d in jest 
i can petruchio help thee to a wife
with wealth enough and young and beauteous 
brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
her only fault and that is faults enough 
is that she is intolerable curst
and shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
that were my state far worser than it is 
i would not wed her for a mine of gold 
hortensio peace thou know st not gold s effect:
tell me her father s name and tis enough 
for i will board her though she chide as loud
as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack 
her father is baptista minola 
an affable and courteous gentleman:
her name is katharina minola 
renown d in padua for her scolding tongue 
i know her father though i know not her 
and he knew my deceased father well 
i will not sleep hortensio till i see her 
and therefore let me be thus bold with you
to give you over at this first encounter 
unless you will accompany me thither 
i pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts 
o my word an she knew him as well as i do she
would think scolding would do little good upon him:
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
why that s nothing an he begin once he ll rail in
his rope-tricks i ll tell you what sir an she
stand him but a little he will throw a figure in
her face and so disfigure her with it that she
shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat 
you know him not sir 
tarry petruchio i must go with thee 
for in baptista s keep my treasure is:
he hath the jewel of my life in hold 
his youngest daughter beautiful binaca 
and her withholds from me and other more 
suitors to her and rivals in my love 
supposing it a thing impossible 
for those defects i have before rehearsed 
that ever katharina will be woo d 
therefore this order hath baptista ta en 
that none shall have access unto bianca
till katharina the curst have got a husband 
katharina the curst 
a title for a maid of all titles the worst 
now shall my friend petruchio do me grace 
and offer me disguised in sober robes
to old baptista as a schoolmaster
well seen in music to instruct bianca 
that so i may by this device at least
have leave and leisure to make love to her
and unsuspected court her by herself 
here s no knavery see to beguile the old folks 
how the young folks lay their heads together 
master master look about you: who goes there ha 
peace grumio it is the rival of my love 
petruchio stand by a while 
a proper stripling and an amorous 
o very well i have perused the note 
hark you sir: i ll have them very fairly bound:
all books of love see that at any hand 
and see you read no other lectures to her:
you understand me: over and beside
signior baptista s liberality 
i ll mend it with a largess take your paper too 
and let me have them very well perfumed
for she is sweeter than perfume itself
to whom they go to what will you read to her 
whate er i read to her i ll plead for you
as for my patron stand you so assured 
as firmly as yourself were still in place:
yea and perhaps with more successful words
than you unless you were a scholar sir 
o this learning what a thing it is 
o this woodcock what an ass it is 
peace sirrah 
grumio mum god save you signior gremio 
and you are well met signior hortensio 
trow you whither i am going to baptista minola 
i promised to inquire carefully
about a schoolmaster for the fair bianca:
and by good fortune i have lighted well
on this young man for learning and behavior
fit for her turn well read in poetry
and other books good ones i warrant ye 
tis well and i have met a gentleman
hath promised me to help me to another 
a fine musician to instruct our mistress 
so shall i no whit be behind in duty
to fair bianca so beloved of me 
beloved of me and that my deeds shall prove 
and that his bags shall prove 
gremio tis now no time to vent our love:
listen to me and if you speak me fair 
i ll tell you news indifferent good for either 
here is a gentleman whom by chance i met 
upon agreement from us to his liking 
will undertake to woo curst katharina 
yea and to marry her if her dowry please 
so said so done is well 
hortensio have you told him all her faults 
i know she is an irksome brawling scold:
if that be all masters i hear no harm 
no say st me so friend what countryman 
born in verona old antonio s son:
my father dead my fortune lives for me 
and i do hope good days and long to see 
o sir such a life with such a wife were strange 
but if you have a stomach to t i god s name:
you shall have me assisting you in all 
but will you woo this wild-cat 
will i live 
will he woo her ay or i ll hang her 
why came i hither but to that intent 
think you a little din can daunt mine ears 
have i not in my time heard lions roar 
have i not heard the sea puff d up with winds
rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat 
have i not heard great ordnance in the field 
and heaven s artillery thunder in the skies 
have i not in a pitched battle heard
loud larums neighing steeds and trumpets clang 
and do you tell me of a woman s tongue 
that gives not half so great a blow to hear
as will a chestnut in a farmer s fire 
tush tush fear boys with bugs 
for he fears none 
hortensio hark:
this gentleman is happily arrived 
my mind presumes for his own good and ours 
i promised we would be contributors
and bear his charging of wooing whatsoe er 
and so we will provided that he win her 
i would i were as sure of a good dinner 
gentlemen god save you if i may be bold 
tell me i beseech you which is the readiest way
to the house of signior baptista minola 
he that has the two fair daughters: is t he you mean 
even he biondello 
hark you sir you mean not her to 
perhaps him and her sir: what have you to do 
not her that chides sir at any hand i pray 
i love no chiders sir biondello let s away 
well begun tranio 
sir a word ere you go 
are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no 
and if i be sir is it any offence 
no if without more words you will get you hence 
why sir i pray are not the streets as free
for me as for you 
but so is not she 
for what reason i beseech you 
for this reason if you ll know 
that she s the choice love of signior gremio 
that she s the chosen of signior hortensio 
softly my masters if you be gentlemen 
do me this right hear me with patience 
baptista is a noble gentleman 
to whom my father is not all unknown 
and were his daughter fairer than she is 
she may more suitors have and me for one 
fair leda s daughter had a thousand wooers 
then well one more may fair bianca have:
and so she shall lucentio shall make one 
though paris came in hope to speed alone 
what this gentleman will out-talk us all 
sir give him head: i know he ll prove a jade 
hortensio to what end are all these words 
sir let me be so bold as ask you 
did you yet ever see baptista s daughter 
no sir but hear i do that he hath two 
the one as famous for a scolding tongue
as is the other for beauteous modesty 
sir sir the first s for me let her go by 
yea leave that labour to great hercules 
and let it be more than alcides twelve 
sir understand you this of me in sooth:
the younges t daughter whom you hearken for
her father keeps from all access of suitors 
and will not promise her to any man
until the elder sister first be wed:
the younger then is free and not before 
if it be so sir that you are the man
must stead us all and me amongst the rest 
and if you break the ice and do this feat 
achieve the elder set the younger free
for our access whose hap shall be to have her
will not so graceless be to be ingrate 
sir you say well and well you do conceive 
and since you do profess to be a suitor 
you must as we do gratify this gentleman 
to whom we all rest generally beholding 
sir i shall not be slack: in sign whereof 
please ye we may contrive this afternoon 
and quaff carouses to our mistress health 
and do as adversaries do in law 
strive mightily but eat and drink as friends 
o excellent motion fellows let s be gone 
the motion s good indeed and be it so 
petruchio i shall be your ben venuto 
why how now dame whence grows this insolence 
bianca stand aside poor girl she weeps 
go ply thy needle meddle not with her 
for shame thou helding of a devilish spirit 
why dost thou wrong her that did ne er wrong thee 
when did she cross thee with a bitter word 
what in my sight bianca get thee in 
was ever gentleman thus grieved as i 
but who comes here 
good morrow neighbour baptista 
good morrow neighbour gremio 
god save you gentlemen 
and you good sir pray have you not a daughter
call d katharina fair and virtuous 
i have a daughter sir called katharina 
you are too blunt: go to it orderly 
you wrong me signior gremio: give me leave 
i am a gentleman of verona sir 
that hearing of her beauty and her wit 
her affability and bashful modesty 
her wondrous qualities and mild behavior 
am bold to show myself a forward guest
within your house to make mine eye the witness
of that report which i so oft have heard 
and for an entrance to my entertainment 
i do present you with a man of mine 
presenting male
cunning in music and the mathematics 
to instruct her fully in those sciences 
whereof i know she is not ignorant:
accept of him or else you do me wrong:
his name is licio born in mantua 
you re welcome sir and he for your good sake 
but for my daughter katharina this i know 
she is not for your turn the more my grief 
i see you do not mean to part with her 
or else you like not of my company 
mistake me not i speak but as i find 
whence are you sir what may i call your name 
petruchio is my name antonio s son 
a man well known throughout all italy 
i know him well: you are welcome for his sake 
saving your tale petruchio i pray 
let us that are poor petitioners speak too:
baccare you are marvellous forward 
o pardon me signior gremio i would fain be doing 
i doubt it not sir but you will curse your
wooing neighbour this is a gift very grateful i am
sure of it to express the like kindness myself 
that have been more kindly beholding to you than
any freely give unto you this young scholar 
that hath been long studying at rheims as cunning
in greek latin and other languages as the other
in music and mathematics: his name is cambio pray 
accept his service 
a thousand thanks signior gremio 
welcome good cambio 
but gentle sir methinks you walk like a stranger:
may i be so bold to know the cause of your coming 
pardon me sir the boldness is mine own 
that being a stranger in this city here 
do make myself a suitor to your daughter 
unto bianca fair and virtuous 
nor is your firm resolve unknown to me 
in the preferment of the eldest sister 
this liberty is all that i request 
that upon knowledge of my parentage 
i may have welcome mongst the rest that woo
and free access and favour as the rest:
and toward the education of your daughters 
i here bestow a simple instrument 
and this small packet of greek and latin books:
if you accept them then their worth is great 
lucentio is your name of whence i pray 
of pisa sir son to vincentio 
a mighty man of pisa by report
i know him well: you are very welcome sir 
take you the lute and you the set of books 
you shall go see your pupils presently 
holla within 
sirrah lead these gentlemen
to my daughters and tell them both 
these are their tutors: bid them use them well 
we will go walk a little in the orchard 
and then to dinner you are passing welcome 
and so i pray you all to think yourselves 
signior baptista my business asketh haste 
and every day i cannot come to woo 
you knew my father well and in him me 
left solely heir to all his lands and goods 
which i have better d rather than decreased:
then tell me if i get your daughter s love 
what dowry shall i have with her to wife 
after my death the one half of my lands 
and in possession twenty thousand crowns 
and for that dowry i ll assure her of
her widowhood be it that she survive me 
in all my lands and leases whatsoever:
let specialties be therefore drawn between us 
that covenants may be kept on either hand 
ay when the special thing is well obtain d 
that is her love for that is all in all 
why that is nothing: for i tell you father 
i am as peremptory as she proud-minded 
and where two raging fires meet together
they do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
though little fire grows great with little wind 
yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
so i to her and so she yields to me 
for i am rough and woo not like a babe 
well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed 
but be thou arm d for some unhappy words 
ay to the proof as mountains are for winds 
that shake not though they blow perpetually 
how now my friend why dost thou look so pale 
for fear i promise you if i look pale 
what will my daughter prove a good musician 
i think she ll sooner prove a soldier
iron may hold with her but never lutes 
why then thou canst not break her to the lute 
why no for she hath broke the lute to me 
i did but tell her she mistook her frets 
and bow d her hand to teach her fingering 
when with a most impatient devilish spirit 
frets call you these quoth she i ll fume
with them: 
and with that word she struck me on the head 
and through the instrument my pate made way 
and there i stood amazed for a while 
as on a pillory looking through the lute 
while she did call me rascal fiddler
and twangling jack with twenty such vile terms 
as had she studied to misuse me so 
now by the world it is a lusty wench 
i love her ten times more than e er i did:
o how i long to have some chat with her 
well go with me and be not so discomfited:
proceed in practise with my younger daughter 
she s apt to learn and thankful for good turns 
signior petruchio will you go with us 
or shall i send my daughter kate to you 
i pray you do 
i will attend her here 
and woo her with some spirit when she comes 
say that she rail why then i ll tell her plain
she sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
say that she frown i ll say she looks as clear
as morning roses newly wash d with dew:
say she be mute and will not speak a word 
then i ll commend her volubility 
and say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
if she do bid me pack i ll give her thanks 
as though she bid me stay by her a week:
if she deny to wed i ll crave the day
when i shall ask the banns and when be married 
but here she comes and now petruchio speak 
good morrow kate for that s your name i hear 
you lie in faith for you are call d plain kate 
and bonny kate and sometimes kate the curst 
but kate the prettiest kate in christendom
kate of kate hall my super-dainty kate 
for dainties are all kates and therefore kate 
take this of me kate of my consolation 
hearing thy mildness praised in every town 
thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded 
yet not so deeply as to thee belongs 
myself am moved to woo thee for my wife 
why what s a moveable 
thou hast hit it: come sit on me 
women are made to bear and so are you 
alas good kate i will not burden thee 
for knowing thee to be but young and light 
should be should buzz 
o slow-wing d turtle shall a buzzard take thee 
come come you wasp i faith you are too angry 
my remedy is then to pluck it out 
who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting in his tail 
whose tongue 
what with my tongue in your tail nay come again 
good kate i am a gentleman 
i swear i ll cuff you if you strike again 
a herald kate o put me in thy books 
a combless cock so kate will be my hen 
nay come kate come you must not look so sour 
why here s no crab and therefore look not sour 
then show it me 
what you mean my face 
now by saint george i am too young for you 
tis with cares 
nay hear you kate: in sooth you scape not so 
no not a whit: i find you passing gentle 
twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen 
and now i find report a very liar 
for thou are pleasant gamesome passing courteous 
but slow in speech yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance 
nor bite the lip as angry wenches will 
nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk 
but thou with mildness entertain st thy wooers 
with gentle conference soft and affable 
why does the world report that kate doth limp 
o slanderous world kate like the hazel-twig
is straight and slender and as brown in hue
as hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels 
o let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt 
did ever dian so become a grove
as kate this chamber with her princely gait 
o be thou dian and let her be kate 
and then let kate be chaste and dian sportful 
it is extempore from my mother-wit 
am i not wise 
marry so i mean sweet katharina in thy bed:
and therefore setting all this chat aside 
thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
that you shall be my wife your dowry greed on 
and will you nill you i will marry you 
now kate i am a husband for your turn 
for by this light whereby i see thy beauty 
thy beauty that doth make me like thee well 
thou must be married to no man but me 
for i am he am born to tame you kate 
and bring you from a wild kate to a kate
conformable as other household kates 
here comes your father: never make denial 
i must and will have katharina to my wife 
now signior petruchio how speed you with my daughter 
how but well sir how but well 
it were impossible i should speed amiss 
why how now daughter katharina in your dumps 
father tis thus: yourself and all the world 
that talk d of her have talk d amiss of her:
if she be curst it is for policy 
for she s not froward but modest as the dove 
she is not hot but temperate as the morn 
for patience she will prove a second grissel 
and roman lucrece for her chastity:
and to conclude we have greed so well together 
that upon sunday is the wedding-day 
hark petruchio she says she ll see thee
hang d first 
is this your speeding nay then good night our part 
be patient gentlemen i choose her for myself:
if she and i be pleased what s that to you 
tis bargain d twixt us twain being alone 
that she shall still be curst in company 
i tell you tis incredible to believe
how much she loves me: o the kindest kate 
she hung about my neck and kiss on kiss
she vied so fast protesting oath on oath 
that in a twink she won me to her love 
o you are novices tis a world to see 
how tame when men and women are alone 
a meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew 
give me thy hand kate: i will unto venice 
to buy apparel gainst the wedding-day 
provide the feast father and bid the guests 
i will be sure my katharina shall be fine 
i know not what to say: but give me your hands 
god send you joy petruchio tis a match 
amen say we: we will be witnesses 
father and wife and gentlemen adieu 
i will to venice sunday comes apace:
we will have rings and things and fine array 
and kiss me kate we will be married o sunday 
was ever match clapp d up so suddenly 
faith gentlemen now i play a merchant s part 
and venture madly on a desperate mart 
twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
twill bring you gain or perish on the seas 
the gain i seek is quiet in the match 
no doubt but he hath got a quiet catch 
but now baptists to your younger daughter:
now is the day we long have looked for:
i am your neighbour and was suitor first 
and i am one that love bianca more
than words can witness or your thoughts can guess 
youngling thou canst not love so dear as i 
graybeard thy love doth freeze 
but thine doth fry 
skipper stand back: tis age that nourisheth 
but youth in ladies eyes that flourisheth 
content you gentlemen: i will compound this strife:
tis deeds must win the prize and he of both
that can assure my daughter greatest dower
shall have my bianca s love 
say signior gremio what can you assure her 
first as you know my house within the city
is richly furnished with plate and gold 
basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands 
my hangings all of tyrian tapestry 
in ivory coffers i have stuff d my crowns 
in cypress chests my arras counterpoints 
costly apparel tents and canopies 
fine linen turkey cushions boss d with pearl 
valance of venice gold in needlework 
pewter and brass and all things that belong
to house or housekeeping: then at my farm
i have a hundred milch-kine to the pail 
sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls 
and all things answerable to this portion 
myself am struck in years i must confess 
and if i die to-morrow this is hers 
if whilst i live she will be only mine 
that only came well in sir list to me:
i am my father s heir and only son:
if i may have your daughter to my wife 
i ll leave her houses three or four as good 
within rich pisa walls as any one
old signior gremio has in padua 
besides two thousand ducats by the year
of fruitful land all which shall be her jointure 
what have i pinch d you signior gremio 
two thousand ducats by the year of land 
my land amounts not to so much in all:
that she shall have besides an argosy
that now is lying in marseilles road 
what have i choked you with an argosy 
gremio tis known my father hath no less
than three great argosies besides two galliases 
and twelve tight galleys: these i will assure her 
and twice as much whate er thou offer st next 
nay i have offer d all i have no more 
and she can have no more than all i have:
if you like me she shall have me and mine 
why then the maid is mine from all the world 
by your firm promise: gremio is out-vied 
i must confess your offer is the best 
and let your father make her the assurance 
she is your own else you must pardon me 
if you should die before him where s her dower 
that s but a cavil: he is old i young 
and may not young men die as well as old 
well gentlemen 
i am thus resolved: on sunday next you know
my daughter katharina is to be married:
now on the sunday following shall bianca
be bride to you if you this assurance 
if not signior gremio:
and so i take my leave and thank you both 
adieu good neighbour 
now i fear thee not:
sirrah young gamester your father were a fool
to give thee all and in his waning age
set foot under thy table: tut a toy 
an old italian fox is not so kind my boy 
a vengeance on your crafty wither d hide 
yet i have faced it with a card of ten 
tis in my head to do my master good:
i see no reason but supposed lucentio
must get a father call d supposed vincentio 
and that s a wonder: fathers commonly
do get their children but in this case of wooing 
a child shall get a sire if i fail not of my cunning 
fiddler forbear you grow too forward sir:
have you so soon forgot the entertainment
her sister katharina welcomed you withal 
but wrangling pedant this is
the patroness of heavenly harmony:
then give me leave to have prerogative 
and when in music we have spent an hour 
your lecture shall have leisure for as much 
preposterous ass that never read so far
to know the cause why music was ordain d 
was it not to refresh the mind of man
after his studies or his usual pain 
then give me leave to read philosophy 
and while i pause serve in your harmony 
sirrah i will not bear these braves of thine 
you ll leave his lecture when i am in tune 
that will be never: tune your instrument 
here madam:
hic ibat simois hic est sigeia tellus 
hic steterat priami regia celsa senis 
hic ibat as i told you before simois i am
lucentio hic est son unto vincentio of pisa 
sigeia tellus disguised thus to get your love 
hic steterat and that lucentio that comes
a-wooing priami is my man tranio regia 
bearing my port celsa senis that we might
beguile the old pantaloon 
madam my instrument s in tune 
spit in the hole man and tune again 
madam tis now in tune 
all but the base 
the base is right tis the base knave that jars 
aside
how fiery and forward our pedant is 
now for my life the knave doth court my love:
pedascule i ll watch you better yet 
mistrust it not: for sure aeacides
was ajax call d so from his grandfather 
you may go walk and give me leave a while:
my lessons make no music in three parts 
are you so formal sir well i must wait 
aside
and watch withal for but i be deceived 
our fine musician groweth amorous 
madam before you touch the instrument 
to learn the order of my fingering 
i must begin with rudiments of art 
to teach you gamut in a briefer sort 
more pleasant pithy and effectual 
than hath been taught by any of my trade:
and there it is in writing fairly drawn 
yet read the gamut of hortensio 
faith mistress then i have no cause to stay 
but i have cause to pry into this pedant:
methinks he looks as though he were in love:
yet if thy thoughts bianca be so humble
to cast thy wandering eyes on every stale 
seize thee that list: if once i find thee ranging 
hortensio will be quit with thee by changing 
[to male] signior lucentio this is the
pointed day 
that katharina and petruchio should be married 
and yet we hear not of our son-in-law 
what will be said what mockery will it be 
to want the bridegroom when the priest attends
to speak the ceremonial rites of marriage 
what says lucentio to this shame of ours 
patience good katharina and baptista too 
upon my life petruchio means but well 
whatever fortune stays him from his word:
though he be blunt i know him passing wise 
though he be merry yet withal he s honest 
go girl i cannot blame thee now to weep 
for such an injury would vex a very saint 
much more a shrew of thy impatient humour 
master master news old news and such news as
you never heard of 
is it new and old too how may that be 
why is it not news to hear of petruchio s coming 
is he come 
why no sir 
what then 
he is coming 
when will he be here 
when he stands where i am and sees you there 
but say what to thine old news 
why petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turned a pair
of boots that have been candle-cases one buckled 
another laced an old rusty sword ta en out of the
town-armory with a broken hilt and chapeless 
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred 
besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose
in the chine troubled with the lampass infected
with the fashions full of wingdalls sped with
spavins rayed with yellows past cure of the fives 
stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the
bots swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten 
near-legged before and with a half-chequed bit
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which being
restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been
often burst and now repaired with knots one girth
six time pieced and a woman s crupper of velure 
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
in studs and here and there pieced with packthread 
who comes with him 
o sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned
like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a
kersey boot-hose on the other gartered with a red
and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty
fancies pricked in t for a feather: a monster a
very monster in apparel and not like a christian
footboy or a gentleman s lackey 
tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion 
yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell d 
i am glad he s come howsoe er he comes 
why sir he comes not 
didst thou not say he comes 
who that petruchio came 
ay that petruchio came 
no sir i say his horse comes with him on his back 
why that s all one 
nay by saint jamy 
i hold you a penny 
a horse and a man
is more than one 
and yet not many 
come where be these gallants who s at home 
you are welcome sir 
and yet i come not well 
and yet you halt not 
not so well apparell d
as i wish you were 
were it better i should rush in thus 
but where is kate where is my lovely bride 
how does my father gentles methinks you frown:
and wherefore gaze this goodly company 
as if they saw some wondrous monument 
some comet or unusual prodigy 
why sir you know this is your wedding-day:
first were we sad fearing you would not come 
now sadder that you come so unprovided 
fie doff this habit shame to your estate 
an eye-sore to our solemn festival 
and tells us what occasion of import
hath all so long detain d you from your wife 
and sent you hither so unlike yourself 
tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear:
sufficeth i am come to keep my word 
though in some part enforced to digress 
which at more leisure i will so excuse
as you shall well be satisfied withal 
but where is kate i stay too long from her:
the morning wears tis time we were at church 
see not your bride in these unreverent robes:
go to my chamber put on clothes of mine 
not i believe me: thus i ll visit her 
but thus i trust you will not marry her 
good sooth even thus therefore ha done with words:
to me she s married not unto my clothes:
could i repair what she will wear in me 
as i can change these poor accoutrements 
twere well for kate and better for myself 
but what a fool am i to chat with you 
when i should bid good morrow to my bride 
and seal the title with a lovely kiss 
he hath some meaning in his mad attire:
we will persuade him be it possible 
to put on better ere he go to church 
i ll after him and see the event of this 
but to her love concerneth us to add
her father s liking: which to bring to pass 
as i before unparted to your worship 
i am to get a man whate er he be 
it skills not much we ll fit him to our turn 
and he shall be vincentio of pisa 
and make assurance here in padua
of greater sums than i have promised 
so shall you quietly enjoy your hope 
and marry sweet bianca with consent 
were it not that my fellow-school-master
doth watch bianca s steps so narrowly 
twere good methinks to steal our marriage 
which once perform d let all the world say no 
i ll keep mine own despite of all the world 
that by degrees we mean to look into 
and watch our vantage in this business:
we ll over-reach the greybeard gremio 
the narrow-prying father minola 
the quaint musician amorous licio 
all for my master s sake lucentio 
signior gremio came you from the church 
as willingly as e er i came from school 
and is the bride and bridegroom coming home 
a bridegroom say you tis a groom indeed 
a grumbling groom and that the girl shall find 
curster than she why tis impossible 
why he s a devil a devil a very fiend 
why she s a devil a devil the devil s dam 
tut she s a lamb a dove a fool to him 
i ll tell you sir lucentio: when the priest
should ask if katharina should be his wife 
ay by gogs-wouns quoth he and swore so loud 
that all-amazed the priest let fall the book 
and as he stoop d again to take it up 
the mad-brain d bridegroom took him such a cuff
that down fell priest and book and book and priest:
now take them up quoth he if any list 
what said the wench when he rose again 
trembled and shook for why he stamp d and swore 
as if the vicar meant to cozen him 
but after many ceremonies done 
he calls for wine: a health quoth he as if
he had been aboard carousing to his mates
after a storm quaff d off the muscadel
and threw the sops all in the sexton s face 
having no other reason
but that his beard grew thin and hungerly
and seem d to ask him sops as he was drinking 
this done he took the bride about the neck
and kiss d her lips with such a clamorous smack
that at the parting all the church did echo:
and i seeing this came thence for very shame 
and after me i know the rout is coming 
such a mad marriage never was before:
hark hark i hear the minstrels play 
music
gentlemen and friends i thank you for your pains:
i know you think to dine with me to-day 
and have prepared great store of wedding cheer 
but so it is my haste doth call me hence 
and therefore here i mean to take my leave 
is t possible you will away to-night 
i must away to-day before night come:
make it no wonder if you knew my business 
you would entreat me rather go than stay 
and honest company i thank you all 
that have beheld me give away myself
to this most patient sweet and virtuous wife:
dine with my father drink a health to me 
for i must hence and farewell to you all 
let us entreat you stay till after dinner 
it may not be 
let me entreat you 
it cannot be 
i am content 
i am content you shall entreat me stay 
but yet not stay entreat me how you can 
grumio my horse 
ay sir they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses 
o kate content thee prithee be not angry 
ay marry sir now it begins to work 
katarina
gentlemen forward to the bridal dinner:
i see a woman may be made a fool 
if she had not a spirit to resist

foul hill my master riding behind my mistress 
curtis

under her horse thou shouldst have heard in how
miry a place how she was bemoiled how he left her
with the horse upon her how he beat me because
her horse stumbled how she waded through the dirt
to pluck him off me how he swore how she prayed 
that never prayed before how i cried how the
horses ran away how her bridle was burst how i
lost my crupper with many things of worthy memory 
which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
unexperienced to thy grave

did i not bid thee meet me in the park 
and bring along these rascal knaves with thee 
nathaniel s coat sir was not fully made 
and gabriel s pumps were all unpink d i the heel

and walter s dagger was not come from sheathing:

than feed it with such over-roasted flesh 
be patient to-morrow t shall be mended 
and for this night we ll fast for company:
come i will bring thee to thy bridal chamber 
nathaniel
peter didst ever see the like 
he kills her in her own humour 
where is he 
curtis
in her chamber making a sermon of continency to her 
and rails and swears and rates that she poor soul 
knows not which way to stand to look to speak 
and sits as one new-risen from a dream 
away away for he is coming hither 
thus have i politicly begun my reign 
and tis my hope to end successfully 
my falcon now is sharp and passing empty 
and till she stoop she must not be full-gorged 
for then she never looks upon her lure 
another way i have to man my haggard 
to make her come and know her keeper s call 
that is to watch her as we watch these kites
that bate and beat and will not be obedient 
she eat no meat to-day nor none shall eat 
last night she slept not nor to-night she shall not 
as with the meat some undeserved fault
i ll find about the making of the bed 
and here i ll fling the pillow there the bolster 
this way the coverlet another way the sheets:
ay and amid this hurly i intend
that all is done in reverend care of her 
and in conclusion she shall watch all night:
and if she chance to nod i ll rail and brawl
and with the clamour keep her still awake 
this is a way to kill a wife with kindness 
and thus i ll curb her mad and headstrong humour 
he that knows better how to tame a shrew 
now let him speak: tis charity to show 
is t possible friend licio that mistress bianca
doth fancy any other but lucentio 
i tell you sir she bears me fair in hand 
sir to satisfy you in what i have said 
stand by and mark the manner of his teaching 
now mistress profit you in what you read 
i read that i profess the art to love 
while you sweet dear prove mistress of my heart 
quick proceeders marry now tell me i pray 
you that durst swear at your mistress bianca
loved none in the world so well as lucentio 
o despiteful love unconstant womankind 
i tell thee licio this is wonderful 
mistake no more: i am not licio 
nor a musician as i seem to be 
but one that scorn to live in this disguise 
for such a one as leaves a gentleman 
and makes a god of such a cullion:
know sir that i am call d hortensio 
signior hortensio i have often heard
of your entire affection to bianca 
and since mine eyes are witness of her lightness 
i will with you if you be so contented 
forswear bianca and her love for ever 
see how they kiss and court signior lucentio 
here is my hand and here i firmly vow
never to woo her no more but do forswear her 
as one unworthy all the former favours
that i have fondly flatter d her withal 
and here i take the unfeigned oath 
never to marry with her though she would entreat:
fie on her see how beastly she doth court him 
would all the world but he had quite forsworn 
for me that i may surely keep mine oath 
i will be married to a wealthy widow 
ere three days pass which hath as long loved me
as i have loved this proud disdainful haggard 
and so farewell signior lucentio 
kindness in women not their beauteous looks 
shall win my love: and so i take my leave 
in resolution as i swore before 
mistress bianca bless you with such grace
as longeth to a lover s blessed case 
nay i have ta en you napping gentle love 
and have forsworn you with hortensio 
mistress we have 
then we are rid of licio 
i faith he ll have a lusty widow now 
that shall be wood and wedded in a day 
ay and he ll tame her 
faith he is gone unto the taming-school 
ay mistress and petruchio is the master 
that teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long 
to tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue 
o master master i have watch d so long
that i am dog-weary: but at last i spied
an ancient angel coming down the hill 
will serve the turn 
what is he biondello 
master a mercatante or a pedant 
i know not what but format in apparel 
in gait and countenance surely like a father 
and what of him tranio 
if he be credulous and trust my tale 
i ll make him glad to seem vincentio 
and give assurance to baptista minola 
as if he were the right vincentio
take in your love and then let me alone 
pedant
god save you sir 
and you sir you are welcome 
travel you far on or are you at the farthest 
pedant
sir at the farthest for a week or two:
but then up farther and as for as rome 
and so to tripoli if god lend me life 
what countryman i pray 
pedant
of mantua 
of mantua sir marry god forbid 
and come to padua careless of your life 
pedant
my life sir how i pray for that goes hard 
tis death for any one in mantua
to come to padua know you not the cause 
your ships are stay d at venice and the duke 
for private quarrel twixt your duke and him 
hath publish d and proclaim d it openly:
tis marvel but that you are but newly come 
you might have heard it else proclaim d about 
pedant
alas sir it is worse for me than so 
for i have bills for money by exchange
from florence and must here deliver them 
well sir to do you courtesy 
this will i do and this i will advise you:
first tell me have you ever been at pisa 
pedant
ay sir in pisa have i often been 
pisa renowned for grave citizens 
among them know you one vincentio 
pedant
i know him not but i have heard of him 
a merchant of incomparable wealth 
he is my father sir and sooth to say 
in countenance somewhat doth resemble you 
[aside] as much as an apple doth an oyster 
and all one 
to save your life in this extremity 
this favour will i do you for his sake 
and think it not the worst of an your fortunes
that you are like to sir vincentio 
his name and credit shall you undertake 
and in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
look that you take upon you as you should 
you understand me sir: so shall you stay
till you have done your business in the city:
if this be courtesy sir accept of it 
pedant
o sir i do and will repute you ever
the patron of my life and liberty 
then go with me to make the matter good 
this by the way i let you understand 
my father is here look d for every day 
to pass assurance of a dower in marriage
twixt me and one baptista s daughter here:
in all these circumstances i ll instruct you:
go with me to clothe you as becomes you 
no no forsooth i dare not for my life 
what say you to a neat s foot 
i fear it is too choleric a meat 
how say you to a fat tripe finely broil d 
i cannot tell i fear tis choleric 
what say you to a piece of beef and mustard 
ay but the mustard is too hot a little 
nay then i will not: you shall have the mustard 
or else you get no beef of grumio 
why then the mustard without the beef 
how fares my kate what sweeting all amort 
mistress what cheer 
pluck up thy spirits look cheerfully upon me 
here love thou see st how diligent i am
to dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:
i am sure sweet kate this kindness merits thanks 
what not a word nay then thou lovest it not 
and all my pains is sorted to no proof 
here take away this dish 
the poorest service is repaid with thanks 
and so shall mine before you touch the meat 
signior petruchio fie you are to blame 
come mistress kate i ll bear you company 
[aside] eat it up all hortensio if thou lovest me 
much good do it unto thy gentle heart 
kate eat apace: and now my honey love 
will we return unto thy father s house
and revel it as bravely as the best 
with silken coats and caps and golden rings 
with ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things 
with scarfs and fans and double change of bravery 
with amber bracelets beads and all this knavery 
what hast thou dined the tailor stays thy leisure 
to deck thy body with his ruffling treasure 
come tailor let us see these ornaments 
lay forth the gown 
what news with you sir 
haberdasher
here is the cap your worship did bespeak 
why this was moulded on a porringer 
a velvet dish: fie fie tis lewd and filthy:
why tis a cockle or a walnut-shell 
a knack a toy a trick a baby s cap:
away with it come let me have a bigger 
when you are gentle you shall have one too 
and not till then 
[aside] that will not be in haste 
why thou say st true it is a paltry cap 
a custard-coffin a bauble a silken pie:
i love thee well in that thou likest it not 
thy gown why ay: come tailor let us see t 
o mercy god what masquing stuff is here 
what s this a sleeve tis like a demi-cannon:
what up and down carved like an apple-tart 
here s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash 
like to a censer in a barber s shop:
why what i devil s name tailor call st thou this 
[aside] i see she s like to have neither cap nor gown 
tailor
you bid me make it orderly and well 
according to the fashion and the time 
marry and did but if you be remember d 
i did not bid you mar it to the time 
go hop me over every kennel home 
for you shall hop without my custom sir:
i ll none of it: hence make your best of it 
why true he means to make a puppet of thee 
tailor
she says your worship means to make
a puppet of her 
o monstrous arrogance thou liest thou thread 
thou thimble 
thou yard three-quarters half-yard quarter nail 
thou flea thou nit thou winter-cricket thou 
braved in mine own house with a skein of thread 
away thou rag thou quantity thou remnant 
or i shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
as thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest 
i tell thee i that thou hast marr d her gown 
tailor
your worship is deceived the gown is made
just as my master had direction:
grumio gave order how it should be done 
i gave him no order i gave him the stuff 
tailor
but how did you desire it should be made 
marry sir with needle and thread 
tailor
but did you not request to have it cut 
thou hast faced many things 
tailor
i have 
face not me: thou hast braved many men brave not
me i will neither be faced nor braved i say unto
thee i bid thy master cut out the gown but i did
not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo thou liest 
tailor
why here is the note of the fashion to testify
read it 
the note lies in s throat if he say i said so 
tailor
[reads] imprimis a loose-bodied gown: 
master if ever i said loose-bodied gown sew me in
the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom
of brown thread: i said a gown 
proceed 
tailor
[reads] with a small compassed cape: 
i confess the cape 
tailor
[reads] with a trunk sleeve: 
i confess two sleeves 
tailor
[reads] the sleeves curiously cut 
ay there s the villany 
error i the bill sir error i the bill 
i commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
sewed up again and that i ll prove upon thee 
though thy little finger be armed in a thimble 
tailor
this is true that i say: an i had thee
in place where thou shouldst know it 
i am for thee straight: take thou the
bill give me thy mete-yard and spare not me 
god-a-mercy grumio then he shall have no odds 
well sir in brief the gown is not for me 
you are i the right sir: tis for my mistress 
go take it up unto thy master s use 
villain not for thy life: take up my mistress 
gown for thy master s use 
why sir what s your conceit in that 
o sir the conceit is deeper than you think for:
take up my mistress gown to his master s use 
o fie fie fie 
[aside] hortensio say thou wilt see the tailor paid 
go take it hence be gone and say no more 
tailor i ll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:
take no unkindness of his hasty words:
away i say commend me to thy master 
well come my kate we will unto your father s
even in these honest mean habiliments:
our purses shall be proud our garments poor 
for tis the mind that makes the body rich 
and as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds 
so honour peereth in the meanest habit 
what is the jay more precious than the lark 
because his fathers are more beautiful 
or is the adder better than the eel 
because his painted skin contents the eye 
o no good kate neither art thou the worse
for this poor furniture and mean array 
if thou account st it shame lay it on me 
and therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith 
to feast and sport us at thy father s house 
go call my men and let us straight to him 
and bring our horses unto long-lane end 
there will we mount and thither walk on foot
let s see i think tis now some seven o clock 
and well we may come there by dinner-time 
it shall be seven ere i go to horse:
look what i speak or do or think to do 
you are still crossing it sirs let t alone:
i will not go to-day and ere i do 
it shall be what o clock i say it is 
[aside] why so this gallant will command the sun 
sir this is the house: please it you that i call 
pedant
ay what else and but i be deceived
signior baptista may remember me 
near twenty years ago in genoa 
where we were lodgers at the pegasus 
tis well and hold your own in any case 
with such austerity as longeth to a father 
pedant
i warrant you 
but sir here comes your boy 
twere good he were school d 
fear you not him sirrah biondello 
now do your duty throughly i advise you:
imagine twere the right vincentio 
tut fear not me 
but hast thou done thy errand to baptista 
i told him that your father was at venice 
and that you look d for him this day in padua 
thou rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink 
here comes baptista: set your countenance sir 
signior baptista you are happily met 
to the pedant
sir this is the gentleman i told you of:
i pray you stand good father to me now 
give me bianca for my patrimony 
pedant
soft son 
sir by your leave: having come to padua
to gather in some debts my son lucentio
made me acquainted with a weighty cause
of love between your daughter and himself:
and for the good report i hear of you
and for the love he beareth to your daughter
and she to him to stay him not too long 
i am content in a good father s care 
to have him match d and if you please to like
no worse than i upon some agreement
me shall you find ready and willing
with one consent to have her so bestow d 
for curious i cannot be with you 
signior baptista of whom i hear so well 
sir pardon me in what i have to say:
your plainness and your shortness please me well 
right true it is your son lucentio here
doth love my daughter and she loveth him 
or both dissemble deeply their affections:
and therefore if you say no more than this 
that like a father you will deal with him
and pass my daughter a sufficient dower 
the match is made and all is done:
your son shall have my daughter with consent 
i thank you sir where then do you know best
we be affied and such assurance ta en
as shall with either part s agreement stand 
not in my house lucentio for you know 
pitchers have ears and i have many servants:
besides old gremio is hearkening still 
and happily we might be interrupted 
then at my lodging an it like you:
there doth my father lie and there this night 
we ll pass the business privately and well 
send for your daughter by your servant here:
my boy shall fetch the scrivener presently 
the worst is this that at so slender warning 
you are like to have a thin and slender pittance 
it likes me well biondello hie you home 
and bid bianca make her ready straight 
and if you will tell what hath happened 
lucentio s father is arrived in padua 
and how she s like to be lucentio s wife 
i pray the gods she may with all my heart 
dally not with the gods but get thee gone 
signior baptista shall i lead the way 
welcome one mess is like to be your cheer:
come sir we will better it in pisa 
i follow you 
cambio 
what sayest thou biondello 
you saw my master wink and laugh upon you 
biondello what of that 
faith nothing but has left me here behind to
expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens 
i pray thee moralize them 
then thus baptista is safe talking with the
deceiving father of a deceitful son 
and what of him 
his daughter is to be brought by you to the supper 
and then 
the old priest of saint luke s church is at your
command at all hours 
and what of all this 
i cannot tell expect they are busied about a
counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her 
cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum: to the
church take the priest clerk and some sufficient
honest witnesses: if this be not that you look for 
i have no more to say but bid bianca farewell for
ever and a day 
hearest thou biondello 
i cannot tarry: i knew a wench married in an
afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
stuff a rabbit and so may you sir: and so adieu 
sir my master hath appointed me to go to saint
luke s to bid the priest be ready to come against
you come with your appendix 
i may and will if she be so contented:
she will be pleased then wherefore should i doubt 
hap what hap may i ll roundly go about her:
it shall go hard if cambio go without her 
come on i god s name once more toward our father s 
good lord how bright and goodly shines the moon 
i say it is the moon that shines so bright 
now by my mother s son and that s myself 
it shall be moon or star or what i list 
or ere i journey to your father s house 
go on and fetch our horses back again 
evermore cross d and cross d nothing but cross d 
say as he says or we shall never go 
i say it is the moon 
nay then you lie: it is the blessed sun 
petruchio go thy ways the field is won 
well forward forward thus the bowl should run 
and not unluckily against the bias 
but soft company is coming here 
good morrow gentle mistress: where away 
tell me sweet kate and tell me truly too 
hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman 
such war of white and red within her cheeks 
what stars do spangle heaven with such beauty 
as those two eyes become that heavenly face 
fair lovely maid once more good day to thee 
sweet kate embrace her for her beauty s sake 
a will make the man mad to make a woman of him 
why how now kate i hope thou art not mad:
this is a man old wrinkled faded wither d 
and not a maiden as thou say st he is 
do good old grandsire and withal make known
which way thou travellest: if along with us 
we shall be joyful of thy company 
fair sir and you my merry mistress 
that with your strange encounter much amazed me 
my name is call d vincentio my dwelling pisa 
and bound i am to padua there to visit
a son of mine which long i have not seen 
what is his name 
lucentio gentle sir 
happily we met the happier for thy son 
and now by law as well as reverend age 
i may entitle thee my loving father:
the sister to my wife this gentlewoman 
thy son by this hath married wonder not 
nor be grieved: she is of good esteem 
her dowery wealthy and of worthy birth 
beside so qualified as may beseem
the spouse of any noble gentleman 
let me embrace with old vincentio 
and wander we to see thy honest son 
who will of thy arrival be full joyous 
but is it true or else is it your pleasure 
like pleasant travellers to break a jest
upon the company you overtake 
i do assure thee father so it is 
come go along and see the truth hereof 
for our first merriment hath made thee jealous 
well petruchio this has put me in heart 
have to my widow and if she be froward 
then hast thou taught hortensio to be untoward 
softly and swiftly sir for the priest is ready 
i fly biondello: but they may chance to need thee
at home therefore leave us 
nay faith i ll see the church o your back and
then come back to my master s as soon as i can 
i marvel cambio comes not all this while 
sir here s the door this is lucentio s house:
my father s bears more toward the market-place 
thither must i and here i leave you sir 
you shall not choose but drink before you go:
i think i shall command your welcome here 
and by all likelihood some cheer is toward 
knocks
they re busy within you were best knock louder 
pedant looks out of the window
pedant
what s he that knocks as he would beat down the gate 
is signior lucentio within sir 
pedant
he s within sir but not to be spoken withal 
what if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to
make merry withal 
pedant
keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
need none so long as i live 
nay i told you your son was well beloved in padua 
do you hear sir to leave frivolous circumstances 
i pray you tell signior lucentio that his father is
come from pisa and is here at the door to speak with him 
pedant
thou liest: his father is come from padua and here
looking out at the window 
art thou his father 
pedant

here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder 
and so it is: i wonder what it bodes

and awful rule and right supremacy 
and to be short what not that s sweet and happy 
now fair befal thee good petruchio 
the wager thou hast won and i will add

another dowry to another daughter 
for she is changed as she had never been

as prisoners to her womanly persuasion 
katharina that cap of yours becomes you not:

widow

till i be brought to such a silly pass

hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time 
katharina i charge thee tell these headstrong women
what duty they do owe their lords and husbands 
widow

widow

why there s a wench come on and kiss me kate

but a harsh hearing when women are froward 
come kate we ll to bed

to male
twas i won the wager though you hit the white 
and being a winner god give you good night 
now go thy ways thou hast tamed a curst shrew 
tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamed so 
my father is deceas d come gaveston 
and share the kingdom with thy dearest friend 
ah words that make me surfeit with delight 
what greater bliss can hap to gaveston
than live and be the favourite of a king 
sweet prince i come these thy amorous lines
might have enforc d me to have swum from france 
and like leander gasp d upon the sand 
so thou wouldst smile and take me in thine arms 
the sight of london to my exil d eyes
is as elysium to a new-come soul:
not that i love the city or the men 
but that it harbours him i hold so dear 
the king upon whose bosom let me lie 
and with the world be still at enmity 
what need the arctic people love star-light 
to whom the sun shines both by day and night 
farewell base stooping to the lordly peers 
my knee shall bow to none but to the king 
as for the multitude that are but sparks 
rak d up in embers of their poverty 
tanti i ll fawn first on the wind 
that glanceth at my lips and flieth away 
but how now what are these 
such as desire your worship s service 
what canst thou do 
i can ride 
but i have no horse what art thou 
a traveller 
let me see thou wouldst do well
to wait at my trencher and tell me lies at dinner-time 
and as i like your discoursing i ll have you 
and what art thou 
a soldier that hath serv d against the scot 
why there are hospitals for such as you:
i have no war and therefore sir be gone 
farewell and perish by a soldier s hand 
that wouldst reward them with an hospital 
ay ay these words of his move me as much
as if a goose should play the porcupine 
and dart her plumes thinking to pierce my breast 
but yet it is no pain to speak men fair 
i ll flatter these and make them live in hope 
you know that i came lately out of france 
and yet i have not view d my lord the king:
if i speed well i ll entertain you all 
we thank your worship 
i have some business: leave me to myself 
we will wait here about the court 
do 
these are not men for me 
i must have wanton poets pleasant wits 
musicians that with touching of a string
may draw the pliant king which way i please:
music and poetry is his delight 
therefore i ll have italian masks by night 
sweet speeches comedies and pleasing shows 
and in the day when he shall walk abroad 
like sylvan nymphs my pages shall be clad 
my men like satyrs grazing on the lawns 
shall with their goat-feet dance the antic hay 
sometime a lovely boy in dian s shape 
with hair that gilds the water as it glides
crownets of pearl about his naked arms 
and in his sportful hands an olive-tree 
to hide those parts which men delight to see 
shall bathe him in a spring and there hard by 
one like actæon peeping through the grove 
shall by the angry goddess be transform d 
and running in the likeness of an hart 
by yelping hounds pull d down shall semm to die:
such things as these best please his majesty 
here comes my lord the king and the nobles 
from the parliament i ll stand aside 
lancaster 
my lord 
that earl of lancaster do i abhor 
will you not grant me this in spite of them
i ll have my will and these two mortimers 
that cross me thus shall know i am displeased 
if you love us my lord hate gaveston 
that villain mortimer i ll be his death 
mine uncle here this earl and i myself 
were sworn to your father at his death 
that he should ne er return into the realm:
and now my lord ere i will break my oath 
this sword of mine that should offend your foes 
shall sleep within the scabbard at thy need 
and underneath thy banners march who will 
for mortimer will hang his armour up 
mort dieu 
well mortimer i ll make thee rue these words:
beseems it thee to contradict thy king 
frown st thou thereat aspiring lancaster 
the sword shall plane the furrows of thy brows 
and hew these knees that now are grown so stiff 
i will have gaveston and you shall know
what danger tis to stand against your king 
well done ned 
my lord why do you thus incense your peers 
that naturally would love and honour you 
but for that base and obscure gaveston 
four earldoms have i besides lancaster 
derby salisbury lincoln leicester 
these will i sell to give my soldiers pay 
ere gaveston shall stay within the realm:
therefore if he be come expel him straight 
barons and earls your pride hath made me mute 
but know i ll speak and to the proof i hope 
i do remember in my father s days 
lord percy of the north being highly mov d 
brav d mowbray in presence of the king 
for which had not his highness lov d him well 
he should have lost his head but with his look
th undaunted spirit of percy was appeas d 
and mowbray and he were reconcil d:
yet dare you brave the king unto his face 
brother revenge it and let these their heads
preach upon poles for trespass of their tongues 
o our heads 
ay yours and therefore i would wish you grant 
bridle thy anger gentle mortimer 
i cannot nor i will not i must speak 
cousin our hands i hope shall fence our heads 
and strike off his that makes you threaten us 
come uncle let us leave the brain-sick king 
and henceforth parley with our naked swords 
wiltshire hath men enough to save our heads 
all warwickshire will leave him for my sake 
and northward lancaster hath many friends 
adieu my lord and either change your mind 
or look to see the throne where you should sit 
to float in blood and at thy wanton head
the glozing head of thy base minion thrown 
i cannot brook these haughty menaces:
am i a king and must be over-rul d 
brother display my ensigns in the field:
i ll bandy with the barons and the earls 
and either die or live with gaveston 
i can no longer keep me from my lord 
what gaveston welcome kiss not my hand:
embrace me gaveston as i do thee 
why shouldst thou kneel know st thou not who i am 
thy friend thyself another gaveston:
not hylas was more mourned for of hercules
than thou hast been of me since thy exile 
and since i went from hence no soul in hell
hath felt more torment than poor gaveston 
i know it brother welcome home my friend 
now let the treacherous mortimers conspire 
and that high-minded earl of lancaster:
i have my wish in that i joy thy sight 
and sooner shall the sea o erwhelm my land
than bear the ship that shall transport thee hence 
i here create thee lord high-chamberlain 
chief secretary to the state and me 
earl of cornwall king and lord of man 
my lord these titles far exceed my worth 
brother the least of these may well suffice
for one of greater birth than gaveston 
cease brother for i cannot brook these words 
thy worth sweet friend is far above my gifts:
therefore to equal it receive my heart 
if for these dignities thou be envied 
i ll give thee more for but to honour thee 
is edward pleas d with kingly regiment 
fear st thou thy person thou shalt have a guard:
wantest thou gold go to my treasury:
wouldst thou be lov d and fear d receive my seal 
save or condemn and in our name command
what so thy mind affects or fancy likes 
it shall suffice me to enjoy your love 
which whiles i have i think myself as great
as cæsar riding in the roman street 
with captive kings at his triumphant car 
whither goes my lord of coventry so fast 
to celebrate your father s exequies 
but is that wicked gaveston return d 
ay priest and lives to be reveng d on thee 
that wert the only cause of his exile 
tis true and but for reverence of these robes 
thou shouldst not plod one foot beyond this place 
i did no more than i was bound to do:
and gaveston unless thou be reclaim d 
as then i did incense the parliament 
so will i now and thou shalt back to france 
saving your reverence you must pardon me 
throw off his golden mitre rend his stole 
and in the channel christen him anew 
ay brother lay not violent hands on him 
for he ll complain unto the see of rome 
let him complain unto the see of hell:
i ll be reveng d on him for my exile 
no spare his life but seize upon his goods:
be thou lord bishop and receive his rents 
and make him serve thee as thy chaplain:
i give him thee here use him as thou wilt 
he shall to prison and there die in bolts 
ay to the tower the fleet or where thou wilt 
for this offence be thou accurs d of god 
who s there convey this priest to the tower 
true true 
but in the meantime gaveston away 
and take possession of his house and goods 
come follow me and thou shalt have my guard
to see it done and bring thee safe again 
what should a priest do with so fair a house 
a prison may beseem his holiness 
tis true the bishop is in the tower 
and goods and body given to gaveston 
what will they tyrannise upon the church 
ah wicked king accursed gaveston 
this ground which is corrupted with their steps 
shall be their timeless sepulchre or mine 
well let that peevish frenchman guard him sure 
unless his breast be sword-proof he shall die 
how now why droops the earl of lancaster 
wherefore is guy of warwick discontent 
that villain gaveston is made an earl 
an earl 
ay and besides lord-chamberlain of the realm 
and secretary too and lord of man 
we may not nor we will not suffer this 
why post we not from hence to levy men 
my lord of cornwall now at every word 
and happy is the man whom he vouchsafes 
for vailing of his bonnet one good look 
thus arm in arm the king and he doth march:
nay more the guard upon his lordship waits 
and all the court begins to flatter him 
thus leaning on the shoulder of the king 
he nods and scorns and smiles at those that pass 
doth no man take exceptions at the slave 
all stomach him but none dare speak a word 
ah that bewrays their baseness lancaster 
were all the earls and barons of my mind 
we d hale him from the bosom of the king 
and at the court-gate hang the peasant up 
who swoln with venom of ambitious pride 
will be the ruin of the realm and us 
here comes my lord of canterbury s grace 
his countenance bewrays he is displeas d 
first were his sacred garments rent and torn 
then laid they violent hands upon him next 
himself imprison d and his goods asseiz d:
this certify the pope: away take horse 
my lord will you take arms against the king 
what need i god himself is up in arms
when violence is offer d to the church 
then will you join with us that be his peers 
to banish or behead that gaveston 
what else my lords for it concerns me near 
the bishoprick of coventry is his 
madam whither walks your majesty so fast 
is it not strange that he is thus bewitch d 
madam return unto the court again:
that sly inveigling frenchman we ll exile 
or lose our lives and yet ere that day come 
the king shall lose his crown for we have power 
and courage too to be reveng d at full 
but yet lift not your swords against the king 
no but we will lift gaveston from hence 
and war must be the means or he ll stay still 
my lords to ease all this but hear me speak:
we and the rest that are his counsellors 
will meet and with a general consent
confirm his banishment with our hands and seals 
what we confirm the king will frustrate 
then may we lawfully revolt from him 
but say my lord where shall this meeting be 
at the new temple 
content 
and in the meantime i ll entreat you all
to cross to lambeth and there stay with me 
come then let s away 
madam farewell 
ay if words will serve if not i must 
edmund the mighty prince of lancaster 
that hath more earldoms than an ass can bear 
and both the mortimers two goodly men 
with guy of warwick that redoubted knight 
are gone towards lambeth: there let them remain 
here is the form of gaveston s exile 
may it please your lordship to subscribe your name 
give me the paper 
quick quick my lord i long to write my name 
but i long more to see him banish d hence 
the name of mortimer shall fright the king 
unless he be declin d from that base peasant 
what are you mov d that gaveston sits here 
it is our pleasure we will have it so 
your grace doth well to place him by your side 
for nowhere else the new earl is so safe 
what man of noble birth can brook this sight 
see what a scornful look the peasant casts 
can kingly lions fawn on creeping ants 
ignoble vassal that like phaeton 
aspir st unto the guidance of the sun 
their downfall is at hand their forces down:
we will not thus be fac d and over-peer d 
lay hands on that traitor mortimer 
lay hands on that traitor gaveston 
is this the duty that you owe your king 
we know our duties let him know his peers 
whither will you bear him stay or ye shall die 
we are no traitors therefore threaten not 
no threaten not my lord but pay them home 
were i a king 
thou villain wherefore talk st thou of a king 
that hardly art a gentleman by birth 
were he a peasant being my minion 
i ll make the proudest of you stoop to him 
my lord you may not thus disparage us 
away i say with hateful gaveston 
and with the earl of kent that favours him 
nay then lay violent hands upon your king:
here mortimer sit thou in edward s throne 
warwick and lancaster wear you my crown 
was ever king thus over-rul d as i 
learn then to rule us better and the realm 
what we have done our heart-blood shall maintain 
think you that we can brook this upstart[ s] pride 
anger and wrathful fury stops my speech 
why are you not mov d be patient my lord 
and see what we your counsellors have done 
my lords now let us all be resolute 
and either have our wills or lose our lives 
meet you for this proud over-daring peers 
ere my sweet gaveston shall part from me 
this isle shall fleet upon the ocean 
and wander to the unfrequented inde 
you know that i am legate to the pope:
on your allegiance to the see of rome 
subscribe as we have done to his exile 
curse him if he refuse and then may we
depose him and elect another king 
ay there it goes but yet i will not yield:
curse me depose me do the worst you can 
then linger not my lord but do it straight 
remember how the bishop was abus d:
either banish him that was the cause thereof 
or i will presently discharge these lords
of duty and allegiance due to thee 
it boots me not to threat i must speak fair:
the legate of the pope will be obey d 
my lord you shall be chancellor of the realm 
thou lancaster high-admiral of our fleet 
young mortimer and his uncle shall be earls 
and you lord warwick president of the north 
and thou of wales if this content you not 
make several kingdoms of this monarchy 
and share it equally amongst you all 
so i may have some nook or corner left 
to frolic with my dearest gaveston 
nothing shall alter us we are resolv d 
come come subscribe 
why should you love him whom the world hates so 
because he loves me more than all the world 
ah none but rude and savage-minded men
would seek the ruin of my gaveston 
you that be noble-born should pity him 
you that are princely-born should shake him off:
for shame subscribe and let the clown depart 
urge him my lord 
are you content to banish him the realm 
i see i must and therefore am content:
instead of ink i ll write it with my tears 
the king is love-sick for his minion 
tis done: and now accursed hand fall off 
give it me: i ll have it publish d in the streets 
i ll see him presently despatch d away 
now is my heart at ease 
and so is mine 
this will be good news to the common sort 
be it or no he shall not linger here 
how fast they run to banish him i love 
they would not stir were it to do me good 
why should a king be subject to a priest 
proud rome that hatchest such imperial grooms 
with these thy superstitious taper-lights 
wherewith thy antichristian churches blaze 
i ll fire thy crazed buildings and enforce
the papal towers to kiss the lowly ground 
with slaughter d priests make tiber s channel swell 
and banks rais d higher with their sepulchres 
as for the peers that back the clergy thus 
if i be king not one of them shall live 
my lord i hear it whisper d everywhere 
that i am banish d and must fly the land 
tis true sweet gaveston: o were it false 
the legate of the pope will have it so 
and thou must hence or i shall be depos d 
but i will reign to be reveng d of them 
and therefore sweet friend take it patiently 
live where thou wilt i ll send thee gold enough 
and long thou shalt not stay or if thou dost 
i ll come to thee my love shall ne er decline 
is all my hope turn d to this hell of grief 
rend not my heart with thy too-piercing words:
thou from this land i from myself am banish d 
to go from hence grieves not poor gaveston 
but to forsake you in whose gracious looks
the blessedness of gaveston remains 
for nowhere else seeks he felicity 
and only this torments my wretched soul 
that whether i will or no thou must depart 
be governor of ireland in my stead 
and there abide till fortune call thee home 
here take my picture and let me wear thine:
o might i keep thee here as i do this 
happy were i but now most miserable 
tis something to be pitied of a king 
thou shalt not hence i ll hide thee gaveston 
i shall be found and then twill grieve me more 
kind words and mutual talk makes our grief greater:
therefore with dumb embracement let us part 
stay gaveston i cannot leave thee thus 
for every look my love drops down a tear:
seeing i must go do not renew my sorrow 
the time is little that thou hast to stay 
and therefore give me leave to look my fill 
but come sweet friend i ll bear thee on thy way 
the peers will frown 
i pass not for their anger come let s go:
o that we might as well return as go 
fawn not on me french strumpet get thee gone 
on mortimer with whom ungentle queen 
i judge no more judge you the rest my lord 
i mean not so your grace must pardon me 
thou art too familiar with that mortimer 
and by thy means is gaveston exil d:
but i would wish thee reconcile the lords 
or thou shalt ne er be reconcil d to me 
away then touch me not come gaveston 
madam tis you that rob me of my lord 
speak not unto her: let her droop and pine 
and witness heaven how dear thou art to me:
there weep for till my gaveston be repeal d 
assure thyself thou com st not in my sight 
look where the sister of the king of france
sits wringing of her hands and beats her breast 
the king i fear hath ill-treated her 
hard is the heart that injures such a saint 
i know tis long of gaveston she weeps 
why he is gone 
madam how fares your grace 
cry quittance madam then and love not him 
fear ye not madam now his minion s gone 
his wanton humour will be quickly left 
for his repeal madam he comes not back 
unless the sea cast up his shipwreck d body 
and to behold so sweet a sight as that 
there s none here but would run his horse to death 
but madam would you have us call him home 
what would you have me plead for gaveston 
plead for him that will i am resolv d 
and so am i my lord: dissuade the queen 
then speak not for him let the peasant go 
no speaking will prevail and therefore cease 
fair queen forbear to angle for the fish
which being caught strikes him that takes it dead 
i mean that vile torpedo gaveston 
that now i hope floats on the irish seas 
it is impossible: but speak your mind 
my lords albeit the queen win mortimer 
will you be resolute and hold with me 
not i against my nephew 
fear not the queen s words cannot alter him 
no do but mark how earnestly she pleads 
and see how coldly his looks make denial 
she smiles: now for my life his mind is chang d 
i ll rather lose his friendship i than grant 
well of necessity it must be so 
my lords that i abhor base gaveston
i hope your honours make no question 
and therefore though i plead for his repeal 
tis not for his sake but to our avail 
nay for the realm s behoof and for the king s 
fie mortimer dishonour not thyself 
can this be true twas good to banish him 
and is this true to call him home again 
such reasons make white black and dark night day 
my lord of lancaster mark the respect 
in no respect can contraries be true 
all that he speaks is nothing we are resolv d 
do you not wish that gaveston were dead 
i would he were 
why then my lord give me but leave to speak 
but nephew do not play the sophister 
this which i urge is of a burning zeal
to mend the king and do our country good 
know you not gaveston hath store of gold 
which may in ireland purchase him such friends
as he will front the mightiest of us all 
and whereas he shall live and be belov d 
tis hard for us to work his overthrow 
mark you but that my lord of lancaster 
but were he here detested as he is 
how easily might some base slave be suborn d
to greet his lordship with a poniard 
and none so much as blame the murderer 
but rather praise him for that brave attempt 
and in the chronicle enrol his name
for purging of the realm of such a plague 
he saith true 
ay but how chance this was not done before 
because my lords it was not thought upon 
nay more when he shall know it lies in us
to banish him and then to call him home 
twill make him vail the top flag of his pride 
and fear to offend the meanest nobleman 
but how if he do not nephew 
then may we with some colour rise in arms 
for howsoever we have borne it out 
tis treason to be up against the king 
so shall we have the people of our side 
which for his father s sake lean to the king 
but cannot brook a night-grown mushroom 
such a one as my lord of cornwall is 
should bear us down of the nobility:
and when the commons and the nobles join 
tis not the king can buckler gaveston 
we ll pull him from the strongest hold he hath 
my lords if to perform this i be slack 
think me as base a groom as gaveston 
on that condition lancaster will grant 
and so will pembroke and i 
and i 
in this i count me highly gratified 
and mortimer will rest at your command 
he s gone and for his absence thus i mourn:
did never sorrow go so near my heart
as doth the want of my sweet gaveston 
and could my crown s revenue bring him back 
i would freely give it to his enemies 
and think i gain d having bought so dear a friend 
my heart is as an anvil unto sorrow 
which beats upon it like the cyclops hammers 
and with the noise turns up my giddy brain 
and makes me frantic for my gaveston 
ah had some bloodless fury rose from hell 
and with my kingly sceptre struck me dead 
when i was forc d to leave my gaveston 
diablo what passions call you these 
that you have parled with your mortimer 
repeal d the news is too sweet to be true 
if it be so what will not edward do 
for thee fair queen if thou lov st gaveston 
i ll hang a golden tongue about thy neck 
seeing thou hast pleaded with so good success 
once more receive my hand and let this be
a second marriage twixt thyself and me 
courageous lancaster embrace thy king 
and as gross vapours perish by the sun 
even so let hatred with thy sovereign s smile:
live thou with me as my companion 
this salutation overjoys my heart 
warwick shall be my chiefest counsellor:
these silver hairs will more adorn my court
than gaudy silks or rich embroidery 
chide me sweet warwick if i go astray 
slay me my lord when i offend your grace 
in solemn triumphs and in public shows
pembroke shall bear the sword before the king 
and with this sword pembroke will fight for you 
but wherefore walks young mortimer aside 
be thou commander of our royal fleet 
or if that lofty office like thee not 
i make thee here lord marshal of the realm 
my lord i ll marshal so your enemies 
as england shall be quiet and you safe 
and as for you lord mortimer of chirke 
whose great achievements in our foreign war
deserve no common place nor mean reward 
be you the general of the levied troops
that now are ready to assail the scots 
in this your grace hath highly honour d me 
for with my nature war doth best agree 
ay isabel ne er was my heart so light 
clerk of the crown direct our warrant forth 
for gaveston to ireland 
beaumont fly
as fast as iris or jove s mercury 
it shall be done my gracious lord 
lord mortimer we leave you to your charge 
now let us in and feast it royally 
against our friend the earl of cornwall comes
we ll have a general tilt and tournament 
and then his marriage shall be solemnis d 
for wot you not that i have made him sure
unto our cousin the earl of glocester s heir 
such news we hear my lord 
that day if not for him yet for my sake 
who in the triumph will be challenger 
spare for no cost we will requite your love 
in this or aught your highness shall command us 
thanks gentle warwick come lets in and revel 
younger mortimer 
nephew i must to scotland thou stay st here 
leave now to oppose thyself against the king:
thou seest by nature he is mild and calm 
and seeing his mind so dotes on gaveston 
let him without controlment have his will 
the mightiest kings have had their minions 
great alexander lov d hephæstion 
the conquering hercules for hylas wept 
and for patroclus stern achilles droop d
and not kings only but the wisest men 
the roman tully lov d octavius 
grave socrates wild alcibiades 
then let his grace whose youth is flexible 
and promiseth as much as we can wish 
freely enjoy that vain light-headed earl 
for riper years will wean him from such toys 
uncle his wanton humour grieves not me 
but this i scorn that one so basely-born
should by his sovereign s favour grow so pert 
and riot it with the treasure of the realm 
while soldiers mutiny for want of pay 
he wears a lord s revenue on his back 
and midas-like he jets it in the court 
with base outlandish cullions at his heels 
whose proud fantastic liveries make such show
as if that proteus god of shapes appear d 
i have not seen a dapper jack so brisk:
he wears a short italian hooded cloak 
larded with pearl and in his tuscan cap
a jewel of more value than the crown 
while others walk below the king and he 
from out a window laugh at such as we 
and flout our train and jest at our attire 
uncle tis this that makes me impatient 
but nephew now you see the king is chang d 
then so i am and live to do him service:
but whiles i have a sword a hand a heart 
i will not yield to any such upstart 
you know my mind: come uncle let s away 
spenser 
seeing that our lord the earl of glocester s dead 
which of the nobles dost thou mean to serve 
not mortimer nor any of his side 
because the king and he are enemies 
baldock learn this of me: a factious lord
shall hardly do himself good much less us 
but he that hath the favour of a king
may with one word advance us while we live 
the liberal earl of cornwall is the man
on whose good fortune spenser s hope depends 
what mean you then to be his follower 
no his companion for he loves me well 
and would have once preferr d me to the king 
but he is banish d there s small hope of him 
ay for a while but baldock mark the end 
a friend of mine told me in secrecy
that he s repeal d and sent for back again 
and even now a post came from the court
with letters to our lady from the king 
and as she read she smil d which makes me think
it is about her lover gaveston 
tis like enough for since he was exil d 
she neither walks abroad nor comes in sight 
but i had thought the match had been broke off 
and that his banishment had chang d her mind 
our lady s first love is not wavering 
my life for thine she will have gaveston 
then hope i by her means to be preferr d 
having read unto her since she was a child 
then baldock you must cast the scholar off 
and learn to court it like a gentleman 
tis not a black coat and a little band 
a velvet-cap d cloak fac d before with serge 
and smelling to a nosegay all the day 
or holding of a napkin in your hand 
or saying a long grace at a table s end 
or making low legs to a nobleman 
or looking downward with your eye-lids close 
and saying truly an t may please your honour 
can get you any favour with great men:
you must be proud bold pleasant resolute 
and now and then stab as occasion serves 
spenser thou know st i hate such formal toys 
and use them but of mere hypocrisy 
mine old lord whiles he liv d was so precise 
that he would take exceptions at my buttons 
and being like pins heads blame me for the bigness 
which made me curate-like in mine attire 
though inwardly licentious enough 
and apt for any kind of villany 
i am none of these common pedants i 
that cannot speak without propterea quod 
but one of those that saith quando-quidem 
and hath a special gift to form a verb 
leave off this jesting here my lady comes 
it shall be done madam 
i knew the king would have him home again 
i humbly thank your ladyship 
the wind is good i wonder why he stays:
i fear me he is wreck d upon the sea 
my lord 
how now what news is gaveston arriv d 
nothing but gaveston what means your grace 
you have matters of more weight to think upon:
the king of france sets foot in normandy 
a trifle we ll expel him when we please 
but tell me mortimer what s thy device
against the stately triumph we decreed 
a homely one my lord not worth the telling 
pray thee let me know it 
but seeing you are so desirous thus it is 
a lofty cedar tree fair flourishing 
on whose top branches kingly eagles perch 
and by the bark a canker creeps me up 
and gets unto the highest bough of all 
the motto æque tandem 
and what is yours my lord of lancaster 
my lord mine s more obscure than mortimer s 
pliny reports there is a flying-fish
which all the other fishes deadly hate 
and therefore being pursu d it takes the air:
no sooner is it up but there s a fowl
that seizeth it: this fish my lord i bear 
the motto this undique mors est 
proud mortimer ungentle lancaster 
is this the love you bear your sovereign 
is this the fruit your reconcilement bears 
can you in words make show of amity 
and in your shields display your rancorous minds 
what call you this but private libelling
against the earl of cornwall and my brother 
they love me not that hate my gaveston 
i am that cedar shake me not too much 
and you the eagles soar ye ne er so high 
i have the jesses that will pull you down 
and æque tandem shall that canker cry
unto the proudest peer of britainy 
thou that compar st him to a flying-fish 
and threaten st death whether he rise or fall 
tis not the hugest monster of the sea 
nor foulest harpy that shall swallow him 
if in his absence thus he favours him 
what will he do whenas he shall be present 
that shall we see: look where his lordship come 
my gaveston 
welcome to tynmouth welcome to thy friend 
thy absence made me droop and pine away 
for as the lovers of fair danaë 
when she was lock d up in a brazen tower 
desir d her more and wax d outrageous 
so did it fare with me: and now thy sight
is sweeter far than was thy parting hence
bitter and irksome to my sobbing heart 
sweet lord and king your speech preventeth mine 
yet have i words left to express my joy:
the shepherd nipt with biting winter s rage 
frolics not more to see the painted spring
than i do to behold your majesty 
will none of you salute my gaveston 
salute him yes welcome lord chamberlain 
welcome is the good earl of cornwall 
welcome lord governor of the isle of man 
welcome master secretary 
brother do you hear them 
still will these earls and barons use me thus 
my lord i cannot brook these injuries 
return it to their throats i ll be thy warrant 
base leaden earls that glory in your birth 
go sit at home and eat your tenants beef 
and come not here to scoff at gaveston 
whose mounting thoughts did never creep so low
as to bestow a look on such as you 
yet i disdain not to do this for you 
treason treason where s the traitor 
here here 
convey hence gaveston they ll murder him 
the life of thee shall salve this foul disgrace 
villain thy life unless i miss mine aim 
no more than i would answer were he slain 
yes more than thou canst answer though he live:
dear shall you both abide this riotous deed:
out of my presence come not near the court 
i ll not be barr d the court for gaveston 
we ll hale him by the ears unto the block 
look to your own heads his is sure enough 
look to your own crown if you back him thus 
warwick these words do ill beseem thy years 
nay all of them conspire to cross me thus:
but if i live i ll tread upon their heads
that think with high looks thus to tread me down 
come edmund let s away and levy men:
tis war that must abate these barons pride 
let s to our castles for the king is mov d 
mov d may he be and perish in his wrath 
cousin it is no dealing with him now 
he means to make us stoop by force of arms:
and therefore let us jointly here protest
to prosecute that gaveston to the death 
by heaven the abject villain shall not live 
i ll have his blood or die in seeking it 
the like oath pembroke takes 
and so doth lancaster 
now send our heralds to defy the king 
and make the people swear to put him down 
letters from whence 
from scotland my lord 
why how now cousin how fare all our friends 
my uncle s taken prisoner by the scots 
we ll have him ransom d man: be of good cheer 
they rate his ransom at five thousand pound 
who should defray the money but the king 
seeing he is taken prisoner in his wars 
i ll to the king 
do cousin and i ll bear thee company 
meantime my lord of pembroke and myself
will to newcastle here and gather head 
about it then and we will follow you 
be resolute and full of secrecy 
i warrant you 
cousin an if he will not ransom him 
i ll thunder such a peal into his ears
as never subject did unto his king 
content i ll bear my part hollo who s there 
ay marry such a guard as this doth well 
lead on the way 
whither will your lordships 
whither else but to the king 
his highness is dispos d to be alone 
why so he may but we will speak to him 
you may not in my lord 
may we not 
how now 
what noise is this who have we here is t you 
nay stay my lord i come to bring you news 
mine uncle s taken prisoner by the scots 
then ransom him 
twas in your wars you should ransom him 
and you will ransom him or else 
what mortimer you will not threaten him 
quiet yourself you shall have the broad seal 
to gather for him th[o]roughout the realm 
your minion gaveston hath taught you this 
my lord the family of the mortimers
are not so poor but would they sell their land 
twould levy men enough to anger you 
we never beg but use such prayers as these 
shall i still be haunted thus 
nay now you are here alone i ll speak my mind 
and so will i and then my lord farewell 
the idle triumphs masks lascivious shows 
and prodigal gifts bestow d on gaveston 
have drawn thy treasury dry and made thee weak 
the murmuring commons overstretched break 
look for rebellion look to be depos d:
thy garrisons are beaten out of france 
and lame and poor lie groaning at the gates 
the wild oneil with swarms of irish kerns 
lives uncontroll d within the english pale 
unto the walls of york the scots make road 
and unresisted drive away rich spoils 
the haughty dane commands the narrow seas 
while in the harbour ride thy ships unrigg d 
what foreign prince sends thee ambassadors 
who loves thee but a sort of flatterers 
thy gentle queen sole sister to valois 
complains that thou hast left her all forlorn 
thy court is naked being bereft of those
that make a king seem glorious to the world 
i mean the peers whom thou shouldst dearly love 
libels are cast against thee in the street 
ballads and rhymes made of thy overthrow 
the northern borderers seeing their houses burnt 
their wives and children slain run up and down 
cursing the name of thee and gaveston 
when wert thou in the field with banner spread 
but once and then thy soldiers march d like players 
with garish robes not armour and thyself 
bedaub d with gold rode laughing at the rest 
nodding and shaking of thy spangled crest 
where women s favours hung like labels down 
and thereof came it that the fleering scots 
to england s high disgrace have made this jig 
maids of england sore may you mourn 
for your lemans you have lost at bannocksbourn 
with a heave and a ho 
what weeneth the king of england
so soon to have won scotland 
with a rombelow 
wigmore shall fly to set my uncle free 
and when tis gone our swords shall purchase more 
if you be mov d revenge it as you can:
look next to see us with our ensigns spread 
my swelling heart for very anger breaks:
how oft have i been baited by these peers 
and dare not be reveng d for their power is great 
yet shall the crowning of these cockerels
affright a lion edward unfold thy paws 
and let their lives -blood slake thy fury s hunger 
if i be cruel and grow tyrannous 
now let them thank themselves and rue too late 
my lord i see your love to gaveston
will be the ruin of the realm and you 
for now the wrathful nobles threaten wars 
and therefore brother banish him for ever 
art thou an enemy to my gaveston 
ay and it grieves me that i favour d him 
traitor be gone whine thou with mortimer 
so will i rather than with gaveston 
out of my sight and trouble me no more 
no marvel though thou scorn thy noble peers 
when i thy brother am rejected thus 
away 
poor gaveston thou hast no friend but me 
do what they can we ll live in tynmouth here 
and so i walk with him about the walls 
what care i though the earls begirt us round 
here comes she that is cause of all these jars 
ay and tis likewise thought you favour em 
my lord dissemble with her speak her fair 
pardon me sweet i forgot myself 
the younger mortimer is grown so brave 
that to my face he threatens civil wars 
why do you not commit him to the tower 
i dare not for the people love him well 
why then we ll have him privily made away 
would lancaster and he had both carous d
a bowl of poison to each other s health 
but let them go and tell me what are these 
tell me where wast thou born what is thine arms 
my name is baldock and my gentry
i fetch from oxford not from heraldry 
the fitter art thou baldock for my turn 
wait on me and i ll see thou shalt not want 
i humbly thank your majesty 
knowest thou him gaveston 
ay my lord 
his name is spenser he is well allied:
for my sake let him wait upon your grace 
scarce shall you find a man of more desert 
then spenser wait upon me for his sake:
i ll grace thee with a higher style ere long 
no greater titles happen unto me
than to be favour d of your majesty 
cousin this day shall be your marriage feast: 
and gaveston think that i love thee well 
to wed thee to our niece the only heir
unto the earl of glocester late deceas d 
i know my lord many will stomach me 
but i respect neither their love nor hate 
the headstrong barons shall not limit me 
he that i list to favour shall be great 
come let s away and when the marriage ends 
have at the rebels and their complices 
my lords of love to this our native land 
i come to join with you and leave the king 
and in your quarrel and the realm s behoof 
will be the first that shall adventure life 
i fear me you are sent of policy 
to undermine us with a show of love 
he is your brother therefore have we cause
to cast the worst and doubt of your revolt 
mine honour shall be hostage of my truth:
if that will not suffice farewell my lords 
stay edmund: never was plantagenet
false of his word and therefore trust we thee 
but what s the reason you should leave him now 
i have inform d the earl of lancaster 
and it sufficeth now my lords know this 
that gaveston is secretly arriv d 
and here in tynmouth frolics with the king 
let us with these our followers scale the walls 
and suddenly surprise them unawares 
i ll give the onset 
and i ll follow thee 
this tatter d ensign of my ancestors 
which swept the desert shore of that dead sea
whereof we got the name of mortimer 
will i advance upon this castle [ s] walls 
drums strike alarum raise them from their sport 
and ring aloud the knell of gaveston 
none be so hardy as to touch the king 
but neither spare you gaveston nor his friends 
o tell me spenser where is gaveston 
i fear me he is slain my gracious lord 
no here he comes now let them spoil and kill 
fly fly my lords the earls have got the hold 
take shipping and away to scarborough:
spenser and i will post away by land 
o stay my lord they will not injure you 
i will not trust them gaveston away 
farewell my lord 
lady farewell 
farewell sweet gaveston and farewell niece 
yes yes for mortimer your lover s sake 
i wonder how he scap d 
who s this the queen 
cease to lament and tell us where s the king 
no madam but that cursed gaveston:
far be it from the thought of lancaster
to offer violence to his sovereign 
we would but rid the realm of gaveston:
tell us where he remains and he shall die 
forslow no time sweet lancaster let s march 
how comes it that the king and he is parted 
here in the river rides a flemish hoy:
let s all aboard and follow him amain 
the wind that bears him hence will fill our sails 
come come aboard tis but an hour s sailing 
madam stay you within this castle here 
nay rather sail with us to scarborough 
madam i cannot stay to answer you:
but think of mortimer as he deserves 
yet lusty lords i have escap d your hands 
your threats your larums and your hot pursuits 
and though divorced from king edward s eyes 
yet liveth pierce of gaveston unsurpris d 
breathing in hope  malgrado all your beards 
that muster rebels thus against your king  
to see his royal sovereign once again 
upon him soldiers take away his weapons 
thou proud disturber of thy country s peace 
corrupter of thy king cause of these broils 
base flatterer yield and were it not for shame 
shame and dishonour to a soldier s name 
upon my weapon s point here shouldst thou fall 
and welter in thy gore 
monster of men 
that like the greekish strumpet train d to arms
and bloody wars so many valiant knights 
look for no other fortune wretch than death 
king edward is not here to buckler thee 
lancaster why talk st thou to the slave 
go soldiers take him hence for by my sword 
his head shall off gaveston short warning
shall serve thy turn: it is our country s cause
that here severely we will execute
upon thy person hang him at a bough 
my lord 
soldiers have him away 
but for thou wert the favourite of a king 
thou shalt have so much honour at our hands 
i thank you all my lords: then i perceive
that heading is one and hanging is the other 
and death is all 
how now my lord of arundel 
my lords king edward greets you all by me 
arundel say your message 
his majesty hearing that you had taken gaveston 
entreateth you by me yet but he may
see him before he dies for why he says 
and sends you word he knows that die he shall 
and if you gratify his grace so far 
he will be mindful of the courtesy 
how now 
renowmed edward how thy name
revives poor gaveston 
no it needeth not:
arundel we will gratify the king
in other matters he must pardon us in this 
soldiers away with him 
why my lord of warwick 
will now these short delays beget my hopes 
i know it lords it is life you aim at 
yet grant king edward this 
shalt thou appoint
what we shall grant soldiers away with him 
thus we ll gratify the king 
we ll send his head by thee let him bestow
his tears on that for that is all he gets
of gaveston or else his senseless trunk 
not so my lord lest he bestow more cost
in burying him than he hath ever earn d 
my lords it is his majesty s request 
and in the honour of a king he swears 
he will but talk with him and send him back 
when can you tell arundel no we wot
he that the care of his realm remits 
and drives his nobles to these exigents
for gaveston will if he seize him once 
violate any promise to possess him 
then if you will not trust his grace in keep 
my lords i will be pledge for his return 
tis honourable in thee to offer this 
but for we know thou art a noble gentleman 
we will not wrong thee so 
to make away a true man for a thief 
how mean st thou mortimer that is over-base 
away base groom robber of king s renown 
question with thy companions and mates 
my lord mortimer and you my lords each one 
to gratify the king s request therein 
touching the sending of this gaveston 
because his majesty so earnestly
desires to see the man before his death 
i will upon mine honour undertake
to carry him and bring him back again 
provided this that you my lord of arundel 
will join with me 
pembroke what wilt thou do 
cause yet more bloodshed is it not enough
that we have taken him but must we now
leave him on had i wist and let him go 
my lords i will not over-woo your honours:
but if you dare trust pembroke with the prisoner 
upon mine oath i will return him back 
my lord of lancaster what say you in this 
why i say let him go on pembroke s word 
and you lord mortimer 
how say you my lord of warwick 
nay do your pleasures: i know how twill prove 
then give him me 
sweet sovereign yet i come
to see thee ere i die 
yet not perhaps 
if warwick s wit and policy prevail 
my lord of pembroke we deliver him you:
return him on your honour sound away 
and other attendants of pembroke 
my lord you shall go with me:
my house is not far hence out of the way
a little but our men shall go along 
we that have pretty wenches to our wives 
sir must not come so near to balk their lips 
tis very kindly spoke my lord of pembroke:
your honour hath an adamant of power
to draw a prince 
so my lord come hither james:
i do commit this gaveston to thee 
be thou this night his keeper in the morning
we will discharge thee of thy charge: be gone 
unhappy gaveston whither go st thou now 
my lord we ll quickly be at cobham 
o treacherous warwick thus to wrong thy friend 
i see it is your life these arms pursue 
weaponless must i fall and die in bands 
o must this day be period of my life 
centre of all my bliss and ye be men 
speed to the king 
my lord of pembroke s men 
strive you no longer: i will have that gaveston 
your lordship doth dishonour to yourself 
and wrong our lord your honourable friend 
no james it is my country s cause i follow 
go take the villain: soldiers come away 
we ll make quick work commend me to your master 
my friend and tell him that i watch d it well 
come let thy shadow parley with king edward 
treacherous earl shall i not see the king 
the king of heaven perhaps no other king 
away 
come fellows: it booted not for us to strive:
we will in haste go certify our lord 
i long to hear an answer from the barons
touching my friend my dearest gaveston 
ah spenser not the riches of my realm
can ransom him ah he is mark d to die 
i know the malice of the younger mortimer 
warwick i know is rough and lancaster
inexorable and i shall never see
my lovely pierce of gaveston again:
the barons overbear with me their pride 
were i king edward england s sovereign 
son to the lovely eleanor of spain 
great edward longshanks issue would i bear
these braves this rage and suffer uncontroll d
these barons thus to beard me in my land 
in mine own realm my lord pardon my speech:
did you retain your father s magnanimity 
did you regard the honour of your name 
you would not suffer thus your majesty
be counterbuff d of your nobility 
strike off their heads and let them preach on poles:
no doubt such lessons they will teach the rest 
as by their preachments they will profit much 
and learn obedience to their lawful king 
yes gentle spenser we have been too mild 
too kind to them but now have drawn our sword 
and if they send me not my gaveston 
we ll steel it on their crest[s] and poll their tops 
this haught resolve becomes your majesty 
not to be tied to their affection 
as though your highness were a school-boy still 
and must be aw d and govern d like a child 
long live my sovereign the noble edward 
in peace triumphant fortunate in wars 
welcome old man: com st thou in edward s aid 
then tell thy prince of whence and what thou art 
low with a band of bow-men and of pikes 
brown bills and targeteers four hundred strong 
sworn to defend king edward s royal right 
i come in person to your majesty 
spenser the father of hugh spenser there 
bound to your highness everlastingly
for favour done in him unto us all 
thy father spenser 
true an it like your grace 
that pours in lieu of all your goodness shown 
his life my lord before your princely feet 
welcome ten thousand times old man again 
spenser this love this kindness to thy king 
argues thy noble mind and disposition 
spenser i here create thee earl of wiltshire 
and daily will enrich thee with our favour 
that as the sunshine shall reflect o er thee 
beside the more to manifest our love 
because we hear lord bruce doth sell his land

your highness with long life and happiness 
and bid me say as plainer to your grace 
that if without effusion of blood
you will this grief have ease and remedy 
that from your princely person you remove
this spenser as a putrifying branch
that deads the royal vine whose golden leaves
empale your princely head your diadem 
whose brightness such pernicious upstarts dim 
say they and lovingly advise your grace
to cherish virtue and nobility 
and have old servitors in high esteem 
and shake off smooth dissembling flatterers:
this granted they their honours and their lives 
are to your highness vow d and consecrate 
ah traitors will they still display their pride 
away tarry no answer but be gone 
rebels will they appoint their sovereign

yet ere thou go see how i do divorce
spenser from thee now get thee to thy lords 
and tell them i will come to chastise them
for murdering gaveston: hie thee get thee gone 
edward with fire and sword follows at thy heels 
my lord[s] perceive you how these rebels swell 
soldiers good hearts defend your sovereign s right 
for now even now we march to make them stoop 
away 
why do we sound retreat upon them lords 
this day i shall your vengeance with my sword

and do confront and countermand their king 
i doubt it not my lord right will prevail 
tis not amiss my liege for either part
to breathe a while our men with sweat and dust
all chok d well near begin to faint for heat 
and this retire refresheth horse and man 
here come the rebels 
look lancaster yonder is edward
among his flatterers 
and there let him be 
till he pay dearly for their company 
and shall or warwick s sword shall smite in vain 
what rebels do you shrink and sound retreat 
no edward no thy flatterers faint and fly 
they d best betimes forsake thee and their trains 
for they ll betray thee traitors as they are 
traitor on thy face rebellious lancaster 
away base upstart brav st thou nobles thus 
a noble attempt and honourable deed 
is it not trow ye to assemble aid
and levy arms against your lawful king 
for which ere long their heads shall satisfy
t appease the wrath of their offended king 
then edward thou wilt fight it to the last 
and rather bathe thy sword in subjects blood
than banish that pernicious company 
ay traitors all rather than thus be brav d 
make england s civil towns huge heaps of stones 
and ploughs to go about our palace-gates 
a desperate and unnatural resolution 
alarum to the fight 
saint george for england and the barons right 
saint george for england and king edward s right

to be aveng d on you for all your braves 
and for the murder of my dearest friend 
to whom right well you knew our soul was knit 
good pierce of gaveston my sweet favourite:
ah rebels recreants you made him away 
brother in regard of thee and of thy land 
did they remove that flatterer from thy throne 
so sir you have spoke: away avoid our presence 
accursed wretches was t in regard of us 
when we had sent our messenger to request
he might be spar d to come to speak with us 
and pembroke undertook for his return 
that thou proud warwick watch d the prisoner 
poor pierce and headed him gainst law of arms 
for which thy head shall overlook the rest
as much as thou in rage outwent st the rest 
tyrant i scorn thy threats and menaces 
it is but temporal that thou canst inflict 
the worst is death and better die to live
than live in infamy under such a king 
away with them my lord of winchester 
these lusty leaders warwick and lancaster 
i charge you roundly off with both their heads 
away 
farewell vain world 
sweet mortimer farewell 
england unkind to thy nobility

there see him safe bestow d and for the rest 
do speedy execution on them all 
be gone 
what mortimer can ragged stony walls
immure thy virtue that aspires to heaven 
no edward england s scourge it may not be 
mortimer s hope surmounts his fortune far 
sound drums and trumpets march with me my friends 
edward this day hath crown d him king anew 
levune and baldock 
levune the trust that we repose in thee
begets the quiet of king edward s land:
therefore be gone in haste and with advice
bestow that treasure on the lords of france 
that therewith all enchanted like the guard
that suffer d jove to pass in showers of gold
to danaë all aid may be denied
to isabel the queen that now in france
makes friends to cross the seas with her young son 
and step into his father s regiment 
that s it these barons and the subtle queen
long levell d at 
yea but levune thou seest 
these barons lay their heads on blocks together:
what they intend the hangman frustrates clean 
have you no doubt my lords i ll clap so close
among the lords of france with england s gold 
that isabel shall make her plaints in vain 
and france shall be obdurate with her tears 
then make for france amain levune away 
proclaim king edward s wars and victories 
fair blows the wind for france: blow gentle gale 
till edmund be arriv d for england s good 
nature yield to my country s cause in this 
a brother no a butcher of thy friends 
proud edward dost thou banish me thy presence 
but i ll to france and cheer the wronged queen 
and certify what edward s looseness is 
unnatural king to slaughter nobleman
and cherish flatterers mortimer i stay
thy sweet escape stand gracious gloomy night 
to his device 
holla who walketh there 
is t you my lord 
mortimer tis i 
but hath thy portion wrought so happily 
it hath my lord: the warders all asleep 
i thank them gave me leave to pass in peace 
but hath your grace got shipping unto france 
fear it not 
madam return to england 
and please my father well and then a fig
for all my uncle s friendship here in france 
i warrant you i ll win his highness quickly 
a loves me better than a thousand spensers 
madam what cheer 
i hear sweet lady of the king s unkindness:
but droop not madam noble minds contemn
despair will your grace with me to hainault 
and there stay time s advantage with your son 
how say you my lord will you go with your friends 
and shake off all our fortunes equally 
so pleaseth the queen my mother me it likes:
the king of england not the court of france 
shall have me from my gracious mother s side 
till i be strong enough to break a staff 
and then have at the proudest spenser s head 
well said my lord 
madam long may you live 
much happier than your friends in england do 
lady the last was truest of the twain:
but mortimer reserv d for better hap 
hath shaken off the thraldom of the tower 
and lives t advance your standard good my lord 
how mean you and the king my father lives 
no my lord mortimer not i i trow 
monsieur le grand a noble friend of yours 
told us at our arrival all the news 
how hard the nobles how unkind the king
hath show d himself: but madam right makes room
where weapons want and though a many friends
are made away as warwick lancaster 
and others of our part and faction 
yet have we friends assure your grace in england 
would cast up caps and clap their hands for joy 
to see us there appointed for our foes 
would all were well and edward well reclaim d 
for england s honour peace and quietness 
but by the sword my lord t must be deserv d:
the king will ne er forsake his flatterers 
my lords of england sith th ungentle king
of france refuseth to give aid of arms
to this distressed queen his sister here 
go you with her to hainault: doubt ye not
we will find comfort money men and friends 
ere long to bid the english king a base 
how say st young prince what think you of the match 
i think king edward will outrun us all 
sir john of hainault pardon us i pray:
these comforts that you give our woful queen
bind us in kindness all at your command 
this noble gentleman forward in arms 
was born i see to be our anchor-hold 
sir john of hainault be it thy renown 
that england s queen and nobles in distress
have been by thee restor d and comforted 
madam along and you my lord[s] with me 
that england s peers may hainault s welcome see 
thus after many threats of wrathful war 
triumpheth england s edward with his friends 
and triumph edward with his friends uncontroll d 
my lord of glocester do you hear the news 
what news my lord 
why man they say there is great execution
done through the realm my lord of arundel

why so: they bark d apace a month ago 
now on my life they ll neither bark nor bite 
now sirs the news from france glocester i trow

as isabella gets no aid from thence 
what now remains have you proclaim d my lord 
reward for them can bring in mortimer 
my lord we have and if he be in england 
a will be had ere long i doubt it not 
if dost thou say spenser as true as death 
he is in england s ground: our port-masters
are not so careless of their king s command 
how now what news with thee from whence come these 
letters my lord and tidings forth of france:
to you my lord of glocester from levune 
read 
my duty to your honour promised etc i
have according to instructions in that behalf dealt with the
king of france and his lords and effected that the queen all
discontented and discomforted is gone: whither if you ask 
with sir john of hainault brother to the marquis into
flanders with them are gone lord edmund and the lord
mortimer having in their company divers of your nation 
and others and as constant report goeth they intend to
give king edward battle in england sooner than he can
look for them this is all the news of import 
your honour s in all service levune 
ah villains hath that mortimer escap d 
with him is edmund gone associate 
and will sir john of hainault lead the round 
welcome o god s name madam and your son 
england shall welcome you and all your rout 
gallop apace bright phbus through the sky 
and dusky night in rusty iron car 
between you both shorten the time i pray 
that i may see that most desired day 
when we may meet these traitors in the field 
ah nothing grieves me but my little boy
is thus misled to countenance their ills 
come friends to bristow there to make us strong:
and winds as equal be to bring them in 
as you injurious were to bear them forth 
nay madam if you be a warrior 
you must not grow so passionate in speeches 
lords sith that we are by sufferance of heaven 
arriv d and armed in this prince s right 
here for our country s cause swear we to him
all homage fealty and forwardness 
and for the open wrongs and injuries
edward hath done to us his queen and land 
we come in arms to wreck it with the sword 
that england s queen in peace may repossess
her dignities and honours and withal
we may remove these flatterers from the king
that havock england s wealth and treasury 
sound trumpets my lord and forward let us march 
edward will think we come to flatter him 
i would he never had been flatter d more 
fly fly my lord the queen is overstrong 
her friends do multiply and yours do fail 
shape we our course to ireland there to breathe 
what was i born to fly and run away 
and leave the mortimers conquerors behind 
give me my horse and let s reinforce our troops 
and in this bed of honour die with fame 
o no my lord this princely resolution
fits not the time: away we are pursu d 
this way he fled but i am come too late 
edward alas my heart relents for thee 
proud traitor mortimer why dost thou chase
thy lawful king thy sovereign with thy sword 
vile wretch and why hast thou of all unkind 
borne arms against thy brother and thy king 
rain showers of vengeance on my cursed head 
thou god to whom in justice it belongs
to punish this unnatural revolt 
edward this mortimer aims at thy life:
o fly him then but edmund calm this rage 
dissemble or thou diest for mortimer
and isabel do kiss while they conspire:
and yet she bears a face of love forsooth:
fie on that love that hatcheth death and hate 
edmund away bristow to longshanks blood
is false be not found single for suspect:
proud mortimer pries near into thy walks 
madam without offence if i may ask
how will you deal with edward in his fall 
tell me good uncle what edward do you mean 
nephew your father i dare not call him king 
my lord of kent what needs these questions 
tis not in her controlment nor in ours 
but as the realm and parliament shall please 
so shall your brother be disposed of 
i like not this relenting mood in edmund:
madam tis good to look to him betimes 
yea madam and they scape not easily
that fled the field 
so are the spensers the father and the son 
this edward is the ruin of the realm 
god save queen isabel and her princely son 
madam the mayor and citizens of bristow 
in sign of love and duty to this presence 
present by me this traitor to the state 
spenser the father to that wanton spenser 
that like the lawless catiline of rome 
revell d in england s wealth and treasury 
your loving care in this
deserveth princely favours and rewards 
but where s the king and the other spenser fled 
spenser the son created earl of glocester 
is with that smooth-tongu d scholar baldock gone 
and shipp d but late for ireland with the king 
some whirlwind fetch them back or sink them all 
they shall be started thence i doubt it not 
shall i not see the king my father yet 
unhappy edward chas d from england s bounds 
madam what resteth why stand you in a muse 
madam have done with care and sad complaint:
your king hath wrong d your country and himself 
and we must seek to right it as we may 
meanwhile have hence this rebel to the block 
rebel is he that fights against the prince:
so fought not they that fought in edward s right 
take him away he prates 
you rice ap howel 
shall do good service to her majesty 
being of countenance in your country here 
to follow these rebellious runagates 
we in mean while madam must take advice 
how baldock spenser and their complices 
may in their fall be follow d to their end 
have you no doubt my lord have you no fear:
as silent and as careful we will be
to keep your royal person safe with us 
free from suspect and fell invasion
of such as have your majesty in chase 
yourself and those your chosen company 
as danger of this stormy time requires 
father thy face should harbour no deceit 
o hadst thou ever been a king thy heart 
pierc d deeply with sense of my distress 
could not but take compassion of my state 
stately and proud in riches and in train 
whilom i was powerful and full of pomp:
but what is he whom rule and empery
have not in life or death made miserable 
come spenser come baldock come sit down by me 
make trial now of that philosophy
that in our famous nurseries of arts
thou suck dst from plato and from aristotle 
father this life contemplative is heaven:
o that i might this life in quiet lead 
but we alas are chas d and you my friends 
your lives and my dishonour they pursue 
yet gentle monks for treasure gold nor fee 
do you betray us and our company 
your grace may sit secure if none but we
do wot of your abode 
not one alive: but shrewdly i suspect
a gloomy fellow in a mead below 
a gave a long look after us my lord 
and all the land i know is up in arms 
arms that pursue our lives with deadly hate 
we were embark d for ireland wretched we 
with awkward winds and with sore tempests driven 
to fall on shore and here to pine in fear
of mortimer and his confederates 
mortimer who talks of mortimer 
who wounds me with the name of mortimer 
that bloody man good father on thy lap
lay i this head laden with mickle care 
o might i never ope these eyes again 
never again lift up this drooping head 
o never more lift up this dying heart 
look up my lord baldock this drowsiness
betides no good here even we are betray d 
upon my life these be the men ye seek 
fellow enough my lord i pray be short 
a fair commission warrants what we do 
the queen s commission urg d by mortimer:
what cannot gallant mortimer with the queen 
alas see where he sits and hopes unseen
t escape their hands that seek to reave his life 
too true it is quem dies vidit veniens superbum 
hunc dies vidit fugiens jacentem 
but leicester leave to grow so passionate 
spenser and baldock by no other names 
i arrest you of high treason here 
stand not on titles but obey th arrest:
tis in the name of isabel the queen 
my lord why droop you thus 
o day the last of all my bliss on earth 
centre of all misfortune o my stars 
why do you lour unkindly on a king 
comes leicester then in isabella s name 
to take my life my company from me 
here man rip up this panting breast of mine 
and take my heart in rescue of my friends 
away with them 
it may become thee yet
to let us take our farewell of his grace 
my heart with pity earns to see this sight 
a king to bear these words and proud commands 
spenser ah sweet spenser thus then must we part 
we must my lord so will the angry heavens 
nay so will hell and cruel mortimer:
the gentle heavens have not to do in this 
my lord it is in vain to grieve or storm 
here humbly of your grace we take our leaves:
our lots are cast i fear me so is thine 
in heaven we may in earth ne er shall we meet: 
and leicester say what shall become of us 
your majesty must go to killingworth 
must it is somewhat hard when kings must go 
here is a litter ready for your grace 
that waits your pleasure and the day grows old 
as good be gone as stay and be benighted 
a litter hast thou lay me in a hearse 
and to the gates of hell convey me hence 
let pluto s bells ring out my fatal knell 
and hags howl for my death at charon s shore 
for friends hath edward none but these 
and these must die under a tyrant s sword 
my lord be going: care not for these 
for we shall see them shorter by the heads 
well that shall be shall be: part we must 
sweet spenser gentle baldock part we must 
hence feigned weeds unfeigned are my woes 
father farewell leicester thou stay st for me 
and go i must life farewell with my friends 
o is he gone is noble edward gone 
parted from hence never to see us more 
rend sphere of heaven and fire forsake thy orb 
earth melt to air gone is my sovereign 
gone gone alas never to make return 
spenser i see our souls are fleeting hence 
we are depriv d the sunshine of our life 
make for a new life man throw up thy eyes
and heart and hand to heaven s immortal throne 
pay nature s debt with cheerful countenance 
reduce we all our lessons unto this 
to die sweet spenser therefore live we all 
spenser all live to die and rise to fall 
come come keep these preachments till you come to
the place appointed you and such as you are have
made wise work in england will your lordships away 
your lordship i trust will remember me 
remember thee fellow what else follow me to
the town 
be patient good my lord cease to lament 
imagine killingworth castle were your court 
and that you lay for pleasure here a space 
not of compulsion or necessity 
leicester if gentle words might comfort me 
thy speeches long ago had eas d my sorrows 
for kind and loving hast thou always been 
the griefs of private men are soon allay d 
but not of kings the forest deer being struck 
runs to an herb that closeth up the wounds:
but when the imperial lion s flesh is gor d 
he rends and tears it with his wrathful paw 
[and] highly scorning that the lowly earth
should drink his blood mounts up to the air:
and so it fares with me whose dauntless mind
th ambitious mortimer would seek to curb 
and that unnatural queen false isabel 
that thus hath pent and mew d me in a prison
for such outrageous passions cloy my soul 
as with the wings of rancour and disdain
full oft[ten] am i soaring up to heaven 
to plain me to the gods against them both 
but when i call to mind i am a king 
methinks i should revenge me of my wrongs 
that mortimer and isabel have done 
but what are kings when regiment is gone 
but perfect shadows in a sunshine day 
my nobles rule i bear the name of king 
i wear the crown but am controll d by them 
by mortimer and my unconstant queen 
who spots my nuptial bed with infamy 
whilst i am lodg d within this cave of care 
where sorrow at my elbow still attends 
to company my heart with sad laments 
that bleeds within me for this strange exchange 
but tell me must i now resign my crown 
to make usurping mortimer a king 
your grace mistakes it is for england s good 
and princely edward s right we crave the crown 
no tis for mortimer not edward s head
for he s a lamb emcompassed by wolves 
which in a moment will abridge his life 
but if proud mortimer do wear this crown 
heavens turn it to a blaze of quenchless fire 
or like the snaky wreath of tisiphon 
engirt the temples of his hateful head 
so shall not england s vine be perished 
but edward s name survive though edward dies 
my lord why waste you thus the time away 
they stay your answer: will you yield your crown 
ah leicester weigh how hardly i can brook
to lose my crown and kingdom without cause 
to give ambitious mortimer my right 
that like a mountain overwhelms my bliss 
in which extreme my mind here murder d is 
but that the heavens appoint i must obey 
here take my crown the life of edward too: 
two kings in england cannot reign at once 
but stay a while: let me be king till night 
that i may gaze upon this glittering crown 
so shall my eyes receive their last content 
my head the latest honour due to it 
and jointly both yield up their wished right 
continue ever thou celestial sun 
let never silent night possess this clime 
stand still you watches of the element 
all times and seasons rest you at a stay 
that edward may be still fair england s king 
but day s bright beams doth vanish fast away 
and needs i must resign my wished crown 
inhuman creatures nurs d with tiger s milk 
why gape you for your sovereign s overthrow 
my diadem i mean and guiltless life 
see monsters see i ll wear my crown again 
what fear you not the fury of your king 
but hapless edward thou art fondly led 
they pass not for thy frowns as late they did 
but seek to make a new-elected king 
which fills my mind with strange despairing thoughts 
which thoughts are martyred with endless torments 
and in this torment comfort find i none 
but that i feel the crown upon my head 
and therefore let me wear it yet a while 
my lord the parliament must have present news 
and therefore say will you resign or no 
i ll not resign but whilst i live [be king] 
traitors be gone and join you with mortimer 
elect conspire install do what you will:
their blood and yours shall seal these treacheries 
this answer we ll return and so farewell 
call them again my lord and speak them fair 
for if they go the prince shall lose his right 
call thou them back i have no power to speak 
my lord the king is willing to resign 
if he be not let him choose 
o would i might but heavens and earth conspire
to make me miserable here receive my crown 
receive it no these innocent hands of mine
shall not be guilty of so foul a crime 
he of you all that most desires my blood 
and will be call d the murderer of a king 
take it what are you mov d pity you me 
then send for unrelenting mortimer 
and isabel whose eyes being turn d to steel
will sooner sparkle fire than shed a tear 
yet stay for rather than i ll look on them 
here here now sweet god of heaven 
make me despise this transitory pomp 
and sit fot aye enthronised in heaven 
come death and with thy fingers close my eyes 
or if i live let me forget myself 
my lord 
call me not lord away out of my sight 
ah pardon me grief makes me lunatic 
let not that mortimer protect my son 
more safety there is in a tiger s jaws
than his embracements bear this to the queen 
wet with my tears and dried again with sighs:
if with the sight thereof she be not mov d 
return it back and dip it in my blood 
commend me to my son and bid him rule
better than i: yet how have i transgress d 
unless it be with too much clemency 
and thus most humbly do we take our leave 
farewell 
i know the next news that they bring
will be my death and welcome shall it be:
to wretched men death is felicity 
another post what news brings he 
such news as i expect come berkeley come 
and tell thy message to my naked breast 
my lord think not a thought so villanous
can harbour in a man of noble birth 
to do your highness service and devoir 
and save you from your foes berkeley would die 
my lord the council of the queen command
that i resign my charge 
and who must keep me now must you my lord 
ay my most gracious lord so tis decreed 
by mortimer whose name is written here 
well may i rent his name that rends my heart 
this poor revenge hath something eas d my mind:
so may his limbs be torn as is this paper 
hear me immortal jove and grant it too 
your grace must hence with me to berkeley straight 
whither you will: all places are alike 
and every earth is fit for burial 
favour him my lord as much as lieth in you 
even so betide my soul as i use him 
mine enemy hath pitied my estate 
and that s the cause that i am now remov d 
and thinks your grace that berkeley will be cruel 
i know not but of this am i assur d 
that death ends all and i can die but once 
leicester farewell 
not yet my lord i ll bear you on your way 
fair isabel now have we our desire 
the proud corrupters of the light-brain d king
have done their homage to the lofty gallows 
and he himself lies in captivity 
be rul d by me and we will rule the realm:
in any case take heed of childish fear 
for now we hold an old wolf by the ears 
that if he slip will seize upon us both 
and gripe the sorer being grip d himself 
think therefore madam that imports us much
to erect your son with all the speed we may 
and that i be protector over him:
for our behoof twill bear the greater sway
whenas a king s name shall be under-writ 
first would i hear news he were depos d 
and then let me alone to handle him 
letters from whence 
from killingworth my lord 
in health madam but full of pensiveness 
the king hath willingly resign d his crown 
further or this letter was seal d lord berkeley came 
so that he now is gone from killingworth 
and we have heard that edmund laid a plot
to set his brother free nor more but so 
the lord of berkeley is so pitiful
as leicester that had charge of him before 
let me alone here is the privy-seal 
who s there call hither gurney and matrevis 
to dash the heavy-headed edmund s drift 
berkeley shall be discharg d the king remov d 
and none but we shall know where he lieth 
speak shall he presently be despatch d and die 
enough matrevis write a letter presently
unto the lord of berkeley from ourself 
that he resign the king to thee and gurney 
and when tis done we will subscribe our name 
it shall be done my lord 
gurney 
my lord 
as thou intend st to rise by mortimer 
who now makes fortune s wheel turn as he please 
seek all the means thou canst to make him droop 
and neither give him kind word nor good look 
i warrant you my lord 
and this above the rest: because we hear
that edmund casts to work his liberty 
remove him still from place to place by night 
till at the last he come to killingworth 
and then from thence to berkeley back again 
and by the way to make him fret the more 
speak curstly to him and in any case
let no man comfort him if he chance to weep 
but amplify his grief with bitter words 
fear not my lord we ll do as you command 
so now away post thitherwards amain 
i will madam 
finely dissembled do so still sweet queen 
here comes the young prince with the earl of kent 
if he have such access unto the prince 
our plots and stratagems will soon be dash d 
how fares my honourable lord of kent 
in health sweet mortimer how fares your grace 
i hear of late he hath depos d himself 
and mine 
ah they do dissemble 
you being his uncle and the next of blood 
do look to be protector o er the prince 
not i my lord: who should protect the son 
but she that gave him life i mean the queen 
mother persuade me not to wear the crown:
let him be king i am too young to reign 
let me but see him first and then i will 
ay do sweet nephew 
why is he dead 
i would those words proceeded from your heart 
inconstant edmund dost thou favour him 
that wast a cause of his imprisonment 
the more cause now have i to make amends 
i tell thee tis not meet that one so false
should come about the person of a prince 
my lord he hath betray d the king his brother 
and therefore trust him not 
but he repents and sorrows for it now 
with you i will but not with mortimer 
why youngling sdain st thou so of mortimer 
then i will carry thee by force away 
help uncle kent mortimer will wrong me 
sister edward is my charge redeem him 
mortimer shall know that he hath wronged me 
hence will i haste to killingworth castle 
and rescue aged edward from his foes 
to be reveng d on mortimer and thee 
my lord be not pensive we are your friends:
men are ordain d to live in misery 
therefore come dalliance dangereth our lives 
friends whither must unhappy edward go 
will hateful mortimer appoint no rest 
must i be vexed like the nightly bird 
whose sight is loathsome to all winged fowls 
when will the fury of his mind assuage 
when will his heart be satisfied with blood 
if mine will serve unbowel straight this breast 
and give my heart to isabel and him:
it is the chiefest mark they level at 
not so my liege: the queen hath given this charge 
to keep your grace in safety:
your passions make your dolours to increase 
this usage makes my misery increase 
but can my air of life continue long 
when all my senses are annoy d with stench 
within a dungeon england s king is kept 
where i am starv d for want of sustenance 
my daily diet is heart-breaking sobs 
that almost rent the closet of my heart:
thus lives old edward not reliev d by any 
and so must die though pitied by many 
o water gentle friends to cool my thirst 
and clear my body from foul excrements 
here s channel-water as our charge is given:
sit down for we ll be barbers to your grace 
traitors away what will you murder me 
of choke your sovereign with puddle-water 
no but wash your face and shave away your beard 
lest you be known and so be rescued 
why strive you thus your labour is in vain 
the wren may strive against the lion s strength 
but all in vain: so vainly do i strive
to seek for mercy at a tyrant s hand 
immortal powers that know the painful cares
that wait upon my poor distressed soul 
o level all your looks upon these daring men
that wrong their liege and sovereign england s king 
o gaveston it is for thee that i am wrong d 
for me both thou and both the spensers died 
and for your sakes a thousand wrongs i ll take 
the spensers ghosts wherever they remain 
wish well to mine then tush for them i ll die 
twixt theirs and yours shall be no enmity 
come come away now put the torches out:
we ll enter in by darkness to killingworth 
how now who comes there 
guard the king sure: it is the earl of kent 
o gentle brother help to rescue me 
keep them asunder thrust in the king 
soldiers let me but talk to him one word 
lay hands upon the earl for his assault 
lay down your weapons traitors yield the king 
edmund yield thou thyself or thou shalt die 
base villains wherefore do you gripe me thus 
bind him and so convey him to the court 
where is the court but here here is the king
and i will visit him: why stay you me 
the court is where lord mortimer remains:
thither shall your honour go and so farewell 
o miserable is that common-weal 
where lords keep courts and kings are lock d in prison 
wherefore stay we on sirs to the court 
ay lead me whither you will even to my death 
seeing that my brother cannot be releas d 
the king must die or mortimer goes down 
the commons now begin to pity him:
yet he that is the cause of edward s death 
is sure to pay for it when his son s of age 
and therefore will i do it cunningly 
this letter written by a friend of ours 
contains his death yet bids then save his life 
edwardum occidere nolite timere bonum est 
fear not to kill the king tis good he die:
but read it thus and that s another sense 
edwardum occidere nolite timere bonum est 
kill not the king tis good to fear the worst 
unpointed as it is thus shall it go 
that being dead if it chance to be found 
matrevis and the rest may bear the blame 
and we be quit that caus d it to be done 
within this room is lock d the messenger
that shall convey it and perform the rest 
and by a secret token that he bears 
shall he be murder d when the deed is done 
lightborn come forth 
art thou so resolute as thou wast 
what else my lord and far more resolute 
and hast thou cast how to accomplish it 
ay ay and none shall know which way he died 
but at his looks lightborn thou wilt relent 
relent ha ha i use much to relent 
well do it bravely and be secret 
you shall not need to give instructions 
tis not the first time i have kill d a man:
i learn d in naples how to poison flowers 
to strangle with a lawn thrust down the throat 
to pierce the wind pipe with a needle s point 
or whilst one is asleep to take a quill 
and blow a little powder in his ears 
or open his mouth and pour quick-silver down 
but yet i have a braver way than these 
what s that 
nay you shall pardon me none shall know my tricks 
i care not how it is so it be not spied 
deliver this to gurney and matrevis:
at every ten-mile end thou hast a horse:
take this : away and never see me more 
no 
no unless thou bring me news of edward s death 
that will i quickly do farewell my lord 
the prince i rule the queen do i command 
and with a lowly congé to the ground
the proudest lords salute me as i pass 
i seal i cancel i do what i will 
fear d am i more than lov d let me be fear d 
and when i frown make all the court look pale 
i view the prince with aristarchus eyes 
whose looks were as a breeching to a boy 
they thrust upon me the protectorship 
and sue to me for that that i desire 
while at the council-table grave enough 
and not unlike a bashful puritan 
first i complain of imbecility 
saying it is onus quam gravissimum 
till being interrupted by my friends 
suscepi that provinciam as they term it 
and to conclude i am protector now 
now all is sure: the queen and mortimer
shall rule the realm the king and none rule us 
mine enemies will i plague my friends advance 
and what i list command who dare control 
major sum quàm cui possit fortuna nocere:
and that this be the coronation-day 
it pleaseth me and isabel the queen 
the trumpets sound i must go take my place 
long live king edward by the grace of god
king of england and lord of ireland 
if any christian heathen turk or jew 
dares but affirm that edward s not true king 
and will avouch his saying with the sword 
i am the champion that will combat him 
none comes: sound trumpets 
champion here s to thee 
what traitor have we there with blades and bills 
edmund the earl of kent 
what hath he done 
a would have taken the king away perforce 
as we were bringing him to killingworth 
did you attempt his rescue edmund speak 
mortimer i did: he is our king 
and thou compell st this prince to wear the crown 
strike off his head: he shall have martial law 
strike off my head base traitor i defy thee 
my lord he is my uncle and shall live 
my lord he is your enemy and shall die 
stay villains 
sweet mother if i cannot pardon him 
entreat my lord protector for his life 
nor i and yet methinks i should command:
but seeing i cannot i ll entreat for him 
my lord if you will let my uncle live 
i will requite it when i come to age 
tis for your highness good and for the realm s 
how often shall i bid you bear him hence 
art thou king must i die at thy command 
at our command once more away with him 
let me but stay and speak i will not go:
either my brother or his son is king 
and none of both them thirst for edmund s blood:
and therefore soldiers whither will you hale me 
what safety may i look for at his hands 
if that my uncle shall be murder d thus 
and shall my uncle edmund ride with us 
gurney i wonder the king dies not 
being in a vault up to the knees in water 
to which the channels of the castle run 
from whence a damp continually ariseth 
that were enough to poison any man 
much more a king brought up so tenderly 
and so do i matrevis: yesternight
i open d but the door to throw him meat 
and i was almost stifled with the savour 
he hath a body able to endure
more than we can inflict: and therefore now
let us assail his mind another while 
send for him out thence and i will anger him 
but stay who s this 
my lord protector greets you 
what s there i know not how to construe it 
gurney it was left unpointed for the nonce 
edwardum occidere nolite timere 
that s his meaning 
know you this token i must have the king 
ay stay a while thou shalt have answer straight 
this villain s sent to make away the king 
i thought as much 
and when the murder s done 
see how he must be handled for his labour 
pereat iste let him have the king 
what else here is the keys this is the lake:
do as you are commanded by my lord 
i know what i must do get you away:
yet be not far off i shall need your help:
see that in the next room i have a fire 
and get me a spit and let it be red-hot 
very well 
need you anything besides 
what else a table and a feather-bed 
that s all 
ay ay: so when i call you bring it in 
fear not thou that 
here s a light to go into the dungeon 
so now 
must i about this gear: ne er was there any
so finely handled as this king shall be 
foh here s a place indeed with all my heart 
who s there what light is that wherefore com st thou 
to comfort you and bring you joyful news 
small comfort finds poor edward in thy looks:
villain i know thou com st to murder me 
to murder you my most gracious lord 
far is it from my heart to do you harm 
the queen sent me to see how you were us d 
for she relents at this your misery:
and what eye can refrain from shedding tears 
to see a king in this most piteous state 
weep st thou already list a while to me 
and then thy heart were it as gurney s is 
or as matrevis hewn from the caucasus 
yet will it melt ere i have done my tale 
this dungeon where they keep me is the sink
wherein the filth of all the castle falls 
o villains 
and there in mire and puddle have i stood
this ten days space and lest that i should sleep 
one plays continually upon a drum 
they give me bread and water being a king 
so that for want of sleep and sustenance 
my mind s distemper d and my body s numb d 
and whether i have limbs or no i know not 
o would my blood dropp d out from every vein 
as doth this water from my tatter d robes 
tell isabel the queen i look d not thus 
when for her sake i ran at tilt in france 
and there unhors d the duke of cleremont 
o speak no more my lord this breaks my heart 
lie on this bed and rest yourself a while 
these looks of thine can harbour naught but death 
i see my tragedy written in thy brows 
yet stay a while forbear thy bloody hand 
and let me see the stroke before it comes 
that even then when i shall lose my life 
my mind may be more steadfast on my god 
what means your highness to mistrust me thus 
what mean st thou to dissemble with me thus 
these hands were never stain d with innocent blood 
nor shall they now be tainted with a king s 
forgive my thought for having such a thought 
one jewel have i left receive thou this: 
still fear i and i know not what s the cause 
but every joint shakes as i give it thee 
o if thou harbour st murder in thy heart 
let this gift change thy mind and save thy soul 
know that i am a king: o at that name
i feel a hell of grief where is my crown 
gone gone and do i [still] remain alive 
you re overwatch d my lord: lie down and rest 
but that grief keeps me waking i should sleep 
for not these ten days have these eye-lids clos d 
now as i speak they fall and yet with fear
open again o wherefore sitt st thou here 
if you mistrust me i ll be gone my lord 
no no for if thou mean st to murder me 
thou wilt return again and therefore stay 
he sleeps 
o let me not die yet o stay a while 
how now my lord 
something still buzzeth in mine ears 
and tells me if i sleep i never wake:
this fear is that which makes me tremble thus 
and therefore tell me wherefore art thou come 
to rid thee of thy life matrevis come 
i am too weak and feeble to resist 
assist me sweet god and receive my soul 
run for the table 
o spare me or despatch me in a trice 
so lay the table down and stamp on it 
but not too hard lest that you bruise his body 
i fear me that this cry will raise the town 
and therefore let us take horse and away 
tell me sirs was it not bravely done 
excellent well: take this for thy reward 
come let us cast the body in the moat 
and bear the king s to mortimer our lord:
away 
is t done matrevis and the murderer dead 
ay my good lord: i would it were undone 
matrevis if thou now grow st penitent 
i ll be thy ghostly father therefore choose 
whether thou wilt be secret in this 
or else die by the hand of mortimer 
gurney my lord is fled and will i fear 
betray us both therefore let me fly 
fly to the savages 
i humbly thank your honour 
as for myself i stand as jove s huge tree 
and others are but shrubs compar d to me:
all tremble at my name and i fear none:
let s see who dare impeach me for his death 
what if he have the king is yet a child 
fear not my lord know that you are a king 
villain 
ho now my lord 
think not that i am frighted with thy words:
my father s murder d through thy treachery 
and thou shalt die and on his mournful hearse
thy hateful and accursed head shall lie 
to witness to the world that by thy means
his kingly body was too soon interr d 
forbid not me to weep he was my father 
and had you lov d him half so well as i 
you could not bear his death thus patiently:
but you i fear conspir d with mortimer 
why speak you not unto my lord the king 
because i think scorn to be accus d 
who is the man dares say i murder d him 
traitor in me my loving father speaks 
and plainly saith twas thou that murder dst him 
but hath your grace no other proof than this 
yes if this be the hand of mortimer 
false gurney hath betray d me and himself 
it is my hand what gather you by this 
that thither thou didst send a murderer 
what murderer bring forth the man i sent 
ah mortimer thou know st that he is slain 
and so shalt thou be too why stays he here 
bring him unto a hurdle drag him forth 
hang him i say and set his quarters up:
and bring his head back presently to me 
madam entreat not: i will rather die
than sue for life unto a paltry boy 
hence with the traitor with the murderer 
base fortune now i see that in thy wheel
there is a point to which when men aspire 
they tumble headlong down: that point i touch d 
and seeing there was no place to mount up higher 
why should i grieve at my declining fall 
farewell fair queen: weep not for mortimer 
that scorns the world and as a traveller 
goes to discover countries yet unknown 
what suffer you the traitor to delay 
some of the attendants 
this argues that you spilt my father s blood 
else would you not entreat for mortimer 
ay madam you for so the rumour runs 
i do not think her so unnatural 
my lord i fear me it will prove too true 
mother you are suspected for his death
and therefore we commit you to the tower 
till further trial may be made thereof 
if you be guilty though i be your son 
think not to find me slack or pitiful 
away with her her words enforce these tears 
and i shall pity her if she speak again 
thus madam tis the king s will you shall hence 
that boots not therefore gentle madam go 
my lord here is the head of mortimer 
go fetch my father s hearse where it shall lie 
and bring my funeral robes 
accursed head 
could i have rul d thee then as i do now 
thou hadst not hatch d this monstrous treachery 
here comes the hearse: help me to mourn my lords 
sweet father here unto thy murder d ghost
i offer up the wicked traitor s head 
and let these tears distilling from mine eyes 
be witness of my grief and innocency 
come gentle ganimed and play with me 
i loue thee well say iuno what she will 
what dares she strike the darling of my thoughts 
by saturnes soule and this earth threatning aire 
that shaken thrise makes natures buildings quake 
i vow if she but once frowne on thee more 
to hang her meteor like twixt heauen and earth 
and bind her hand and foote with golden cordes 
as once i did for harming hercules 
what ist sweet wagge i should deny thy youth 
whose face reflects such pleasure to mine eyes 
as i exhal d with thy fire darting beames 
haue oft driuen backe the horses of the night 
when as they would haue hal d thee from my sight:
sit on my knee and call for thy content 
controule proud fate and cut the thred of time 
why are not all the gods at thy commaund 
and heauen and earth the bounds of thy delight 
vulcan shall daunce to make thee laughing sport 
and my nine daughters sing when thou art sad 
from iunos bird ile pluck her spotted pride 
to make thee fannes wherewith to coole thy face 
and venus swannes shall shed their siluer downe 
to sweeten out the slumbers of thy bed:
hermes no more shall shew the world his wings 
if that thy fancie in his feathers dwell 
but as this one ile teare them all from him 
doe thou but say their colour pleaseth me:
hold here my little loue these linked gems 
my iuno ware vpon her marriage day 
put thou about thy necke my owne sweet heart 
and tricke thy armes and shoulders with my theft 
and shall haue ganimed if thou wilt be my loue 
content thee cytherea in thy care 
since thy æneas wandring fate is firme 
whose wearie lims shall shortly make repose 
in those faire walles i promist him of yore:
but first in bloud must his good fortune bud 
before he be the lord of turnus towne 
or force her smile that hetherto hath frownd:
three winters shall he with the rutiles warre 
and in the end subdue them with his sword 
and full three sommers likewise shall he waste 
in mannaging those fierce barbarian mindes:
which once performd poore troy so long supprest 
from forth her ashes shall aduance her head 
and flourish once againe that erst was dead:
but bright ascanius beauties better worke 
who with the sunne deuides one radiant shape 
shall build his throne amidst those starrie towers 
that earth-borne atlas groning vnderprops:
no bounds but heauen shall bound his emperie 
whose azured gates enchased with his name 
shall make the morning halt her gray vprise 
to feede her eyes with his engrauen fame 
thus in stoute hectors race three hundred yeares 
the romane scepter royall shall remaine 
till that a princesse priest conceau d by mars 
shall yeeld to dignitie a dubble birth 
who will eternish troy in their attempts 
i will take order for that presently:
hermes awake and haste to neptunes realme 
whereas the wind-god warring now with fate 
besiege the ofspring of our kingly loynes 
charge him from me to turne his stormie powers 
and fetter them in vulcans sturdie brasse 
that durst thus proudly wrong our kinsmans peace 
venus farewell thy sonne shall be our care:
come ganimed we must about this geare 
you sonnes of care companions of my course 
priams misfortune followes vs by sea 
and helens rape doth haunt thee at the heeles 
how many dangers haue we ouer past 
both barking scilla and the sounding rocks 
the cyclops shelues and grim ceranias seate
haue you oregone and yet remaine aliue 
pluck vp your hearts since fate still rests our friend 
and chaunging heauens may those good daies returne 
which pergama did vaunt in all her pride 
braue prince of troy thou onely art our god 
that by thy vertues freest vs from annoy 
and makes our hopes suruiue to cunning ioyes:
doe thou but smile and clowdie heauen will cleare 
whose night and day descendeth from thy browes:
though we be now in extreame miserie 
and rest the map of weatherbeaten woe:
yet shall the aged sunne shed forth his aire 
to make vs liue vnto our former heate 
and euery beast the forrest doth send forth 
bequeath her young ones to our scanted foode 
father i faint good father giue me meate 
alas sweet boy thou must be still a while 
till we haue fire to dresse the meate we kild:
gentle achates reach the tinder boxe 
that we may make a fire to warme vs with 
and rost our new found victuals on this shoare 
hold take this candle and goe light a fire 
you shall haue leaues and windfall bowes enow
neere to these woods to rost your meate withall:
ascanius goe and drie thy drenched lims 
whiles i with my achates roaue abroad 
to know what coast the winde hath driuen vs on 
or whether men or beasts inhabite it 
the ayre is pleasant and the soyle most fit
for cities and societies supports:
yet much i maruell that i cannot finde 
no steps of men imprinted in the earth 
i neither saw nor heard of any such:
but what may i faire virgin call your name 
whose lookes set forth no mortall forme to view 
nor speech bewraies ought humaine in thy birth 
thou art a goddesse that delud st our eyes 
and shrowdes thy beautie in this borrowd shape 
but whether thou the sunnes bright sister be 
or one of chast dianas fellow nimphs 
liue happie in the height of all content 
and lighten our extreames with this one boone 
as to instruct us vnder what good heauen
we breathe as now and what this world is calde 
on which by tempests furie we are cast 
tell vs o tell vs that are ignorant 
and this right hand shall make thy altars crack
with mountaine heapes of milke white sacrifize 
of troy am i æneas is my name 
who driuen by warre from forth my natiue world 
put sailes to sea to seeke out italy 
and my diuine descent from sceptred iove 
with twise twelue phrigian ships i plowed the deepe 
and made that way my mother venus led:
but of them all scarce seuen doe anchor safe 
and they so wrackt and weltred by the waues 
as euery tide tilts twixt their oken sides:
and all of them vnburdened of their loade 
are ballassed with billowes watrie weight 
but haples i god wot poore and vnknowne 
doe trace these libian deserts all despisde 
exild forth europe and wide asia both 
and haue not any couerture but heauen 
achates tis my mother that is fled 
i know her by the mouings of her feete:
stay gentle venus flye not from thy sonne 
too cruell why wilt thou forsake me thus 
or in these shades deceiu st mine eye so oft 
why talke we not together hand in hand 
and tell our griefes in more familiar termes:
but thou art gone and leau st me here alone 
to dull the ayre with my discoursiue moane 
follow ye troians follow this braue lord 
and plaine to him the summe of your distresse 
why what are you or wherefore doe you sewe 
wretches of troy enuied of the windes 
that craue such fauour at your honors feete 
as poore distressed miserie may pleade:
saue saue o saue our ships from cruell fire 
that doe complaine the wounds of thousand waues 
and spare our liues whom euery spite pursues 
we come not we to wrong your libian gods 
or steale your houshold lares from their shrines:
our hands are not prepar d to lawles spoyle 
nor armed to offend in any kind:
such force is farre from our vnweaponed thoughts 
whose fading weale of victorie forsooke 
forbids all hope to harbour neere our hearts 
but tell me troians troians if you be 
vnto what fruitfull quarters were ye bound 
before that boreas buckled with your sailes 
there is a place hesperia term d by vs 
an ancient empire famoused for armes 
and fertile in faire ceres furrowed wealth 
which now we call italia of his name 
that in such peace long time did rule the same:
thither made we 
when suddenly gloomie orion rose 
and led our ships into the shallow sands 
whereas the southerne winde with brackish breath 
disperst them all amongst the wrackfull rockes:
from thence a fewe of vs escapt to land 
the rest we feare are foulded in the flouds 
braue men at armes abandon fruitles feares 
since carthage knowes to entertaine distresse 
i but the barbarous sort doe threat our ships 
and will not let vs lodge vpon the sands:
in multitudes they swarme vnto the shoare 
and from the first earth interdict our feete 
my selfe will see they shall not trouble ye 
your men and you shall banquet in our court 
and euery troian be as welcome here 
as iupiter to sillie vausis house:
come in with me ile bring you to my queene 
who shall confirme my words with further deedes 
thankes gentle lord for such vnlookt for grace 
might we but once more see æneas face 
then would we hope to quite such friendly turnes 
as shall surpasse the wonder of our speech 
where am i now these should be carthage walles 
why stands my sweete æneas thus amazde 
o my achates theban niobe 
who for her sonnes death wept out life and breath 
and drie with griefe was turnd into a stone 
had not such passions in her head as i 
me thinkes that towne there should be troy yon idas hill 
there zanthus streame because here s priamus 
and when i know it is not then i dye 
and in this humor is achates to 
i cannot choose but fall vpon my knees 
and kisse his hand: o where is hecuba 
here she was wont to sit but sauing ayre
is nothing here and what is this but stone 
o yet this stone doth make æneas weepe 
and would my prayers  as pigmalions did  
could giue it life that vnder his conduct
we might saile backe to troy and be reuengde
on these hard harted grecians which reioyce
that nothing now is left of priamus:
o priamus is left and this is he 
come come abourd pursue the hatefull greekes 
what means æneas 
achates though mine eyes say this is stone 
yet thinkes my minde that this is priamus:
and when my grieued heart sighes and sayes no 
then would it leape out to giue priam life:
o were i not at all so thou mightst be 
achates see king priam wags his hand 
he is aliue troy is not ouercome 
thy mind æneas that would haue it so
deludes thy eye sight priamus is dead 
ah troy is sackt and priamus is dead 
and why should poore æneas be aliue 
sweete father leaue to weepe this is not he:
for were it priam he would smile on me 
æneas see here come the citizens 
leaue to lament lest they laugh at our feares 
lords of this towne or whatsoeuer stile
belongs vnto your name vouchsafe of ruth
to tell vs who inhabits this faire towne 
what kind of people and who gouernes them:
for we are strangers driuen on this shore 
and scarcely know within what clime we are 
i heare æneas voyce but see him not 
for none of these can be our generall 
like illioneus speakes this noble man 
but illioneus goes not in such robes 
you are achates or i deciu d 
æneas see sergestus or his ghost 
he meanes æneas let vs kisse his feete 
it is our captaine see ascanius 
liue long æneas and ascanius 
achates speake for i am ouerioyed 
o illioneus art thou yet aliue 
blest be the time i see achates face 
why turnes æneas from his trustie friends 
sergestus illioneus and the rest 
your sight amazde me o what destinies
haue brought my sweete companions in such plight 
o tell me for i long to be resolu d 
louely æneas these are carthage walles 
and here queene dido weares th imperiall crowne 
who for troyes sake hath entertaind vs all 
and clad vs in these wealthie robes we weare 
oft hath she askt vs vnder whom we seru d 
and when we told her she would weepe for griefe 
thinking the sea had swallowed vp thy ships 
and now she sees thee how will she reioyce 
see where her seruitors passe through the hall
bearing a banket dido is not farre 
looke where she comes: æneas viewd her well 
well may i view her but she sees not me 
sometime i was a troian mightie queene:
but troy is not what shall i say i am 
renowmed dido tis our generall: warlike æneas 
this is no seate for one thats comfortles 
may it please your grace to let æneas waite:
for though my birth be great my fortunes meane 
too meane to be companion to a queene 
this place beseemes me not o pardon me 
madame you shall be my mother 
in all humilitie i thanke your grace 
and who so miserable as æneas is 
o priamus o troy oh hecuba 
a wofull tale bids dido to vnfould 
whose memorie like pale deaths stony mace 
beates forth my senses from this troubled soule 
and makes æneas sinke at female
feete 
then speake æneas with achilles tongue 
and dido and you carthaginian peeres
heare me but yet with mirmidons harsh eares 
daily inur d to broyles and massacres 
lest you be mou d too much with my sad tale 
the grecian souldiers tired with ten yeares warre 
began to crye let vs vnto our ships 
troy is inuincible why stay we here 
with whose outcryes atrides being apal d 
summoned the captaines to his princely tent 
who looking on the scarres we troians gaue 
seeing the number of their men decreast 
and the remainder weake and out of heart 
gaue vp their voyces to dislodge the campe 
and so in troopes all marcht to tenedos:
where when they came vlysses on the sand
assayd with honey words to turne them backe:
and as he spoke to further his entent 
the windes did driue huge billowes to the shoare 
and heauen was darkned with tempestuous clowdes:
then he alleag d the gods would haue them stay 
and prophecied troy should be ouercome:
and therewithall he calde false sinon forth 
a man compact of craft and periurie 
whose ticing tongue was made of hermes pipe 
to force an hundred watchfull eyes to sleepe:
and him epeus hauing made the horse 
with sacrificing wreathes vpon his head 
vlysses sent to our vnhappie towne:
who groueling in the mire of zanthus bankes 
his hands bound at his back and both his eyes
turnd vp to heauen as one resolu d to dye 
our phrigian shepherd haled within the gates 
and brought vnto the court of priamus:
to whom he vsed action so pitifull 
lookes so remorcefull vowes so forcible 
as therewithall the old man ouercome 
kist him imbrast him and vnloosde his bands 
and then o dido pardon me 
o th inchaunting words of that base slaue 
made him to thinke epeus pine-tree horse
a sacrifize t appease mineruas wrath:
the rather for that one laocoon
breaking a speare vpon his hollow breast 
was with two winged serpents stung to death 
whereat agast we were commanded straight
with reuerence to draw it into troy 
in which vnhappie worke was i employd 
these hands did helpe to hale it to the gates 
through which it could not enter twas so huge 
o had it neuer entred troy had stood 
but priamus impatient of delay 
inforst a wide breach in that rampierd wall 
which thousand battering rams could neuer pierce 
and so came in this fatall instrument:
at whose accursed feete as ouerioyed 
we banquetted till ouercome with wine 
some surfetted and others soundly slept 
which sinon viewing causde the greekish spyes
to hast to tenedos and tell the campe:
then he vnlockt the horse and suddenly
from out his entrailes neoptolemus
setting his speare vpon the ground leapt forth 
and after him a thousand grecians more 
in whose sterne faces shin d the quenchles fire 
that after burnt the pride of asia 
by this the campe was come vnto the walles 
and through the breach did march into the streetes 
where meeting with the rest kill kill they cryed 
frighted with this confused noyse i rose 
and looking from a turret might behold
yong infants swimming in their parents bloud 
headles carkasses piled vp in heapes 
virgins halfe dead dragged by their golden haire 
and with maine force flung on a ring of pikes 
old men with swords thrust through their aged sides 
kneeling for mercie to a greekish lad 
who with steele pol-axes dasht out their braines 
then buckled i mine armour drew my sword 
and thinking to goe downe came hectors ghost
with ashie visage blewish sulphure eyes 
his armes torne from his shoulders and his breast
furrowd with wounds and that which made me weepe 
thongs at his heeles by which achilles horse
drew him in triumph through the greekish campe 
burst from the earth crying æneas flye 
troy is a fire the grecians haue the towne 
yet flung i forth and desperate of my life 
ran in the thickest throngs and with this sword
sent many of their sauadge ghosts to hell 
at last came pirrhus fell and full of ire 
his harnesse dropping bloud and on his speare
the mangled head of priams yongest sonne 
and after him his band of mirmidons 
with balles of wilde fire in their murdering pawes 
which made the funerall flame that burnt faire troy:
all which hemd me about crying this is he 
my mother venus iealous of my health 
conuaid me from their crooked nets and bands:
so i escapt the furious pirrhus wrath:
who then ran to the pallace of the king 
and at ioues altar finding priamus 
about whose withered necke hung hecuba 
foulding his hand in hers and ioyntly both
beating their breasts and falling on the ground 
he with his faulchions poynt raisde vp at once 
and with megeras eyes stared in their face 
threatning a thousand deaths at euery glaunce 
to whom the aged king thus trembling spoke:
achilles sonne remember what i was 
father of fiftie sonnes but they are slaine 
lord of my fortune but my fortunes turnd 
king of this citie but my troy is fired 
and now am neither father lord nor king:
yet who so wretched but desires to liue 
o let me liue great neoptolemus 
not mou d at all but smiling at his teares 
this butcher whil st his hands were yet held vp 
treading vpon his breast strooke off his hands 
at which the franticke queene leapt on his face 
and in his eyelids hanging by the nayles 
a little while prolong d her husbands life:
at last the souldiers puld her by the heeles 
and swong her howling in the emptie ayre 
which sent an eccho to the wounded king:
whereat he lifted vp his bedred lims 
and would haue grappeld with achilles sonne 
forgetting both his want of strength and hands 
which he disdaining whiskt his sword about 
and with the wound thereof the king fell downe:
then from the nauell to the throat at once 
he ript old priam: at whose latter gaspe
ioues marble statue gan to bend the brow 
as lothing pirrhus for this wicked act:
yet he vndaunted tooke his fathers flagge 
and dipt it in the old kings chill cold bloud 
and then in triumph ran into the streetes 
through which he could not passe for slaughtred men:
so leaning on his sword he stood stone still 
viewing the fire wherewith rich ilion burnt 
by this i got my father on my backe 
this yong boy in mine armes and by the hand
led faire creusa my beloued wife 
when thou achates with thy sword mad st way 
and we were round inuiron d with the greekes:
o there i lost my wife: and had not we
fought manfully i had not told this tale:
yet manhood would not serue of force we fled 
and as we went vnto our ships thou knowest
we sawe cassandra sprauling in the streetes 
whom aiax rauisht in dianas fawne 
her cheekes swolne with sighes her haire all rent 
whom i tooke vp to beare vnto our ships 
but suddenly the grecians followed vs 
and i alas was forst to let her lye 
then got we to our ships and being abourd 
polixena cryed out æneas stay 
the greekes pursue me stay and take me in 
moued with her voyce i lept into the sea 
thinking to beare her on my backe abourd:
for all our ships were launcht into the deepe 
and as i swomme she standing on the shoare 
was by the cruell mirmidons surprizd 
and after by that pirrhus sacrifizde 
how got æneas to the fleete againe 
achates speake sorrow hath tired me quite 
what happened to the queene we cannot shewe 
we heare they led her captiue into greece 
as for æneas he swomme quickly backe 
and helena betraied diiphobus
her louer after alexander dyed 
and so was reconcil d to menelaus 
are you queene female
sonne 
i and my mother gaue me this fine bow 
shall i haue such a quiuer and a bow 
i will faire mother and so play my part 
as euery touch shall wound queene female
heart 
now cupid cause the carthaginian queene 
to be inamourd of thy brothers lookes 
conuey this golden arrowe in thy sleeue 
lest she imagine thou art venus sonne:
and when she strokes thee softly on the head 
then shall i touch her breast and conquer her 
how long faire dido shall i pine for thee 
tis not enough that thou doest graunt me loue 
but that i may enioy what i desire:
that loue is childish which consists in words 
but dido is the fauour i request 
no dido will not take me in her armes 
i shall not be her sonne she loues me not 
my cosin helen taught it me in troy 
will dido let me hang about her necke 
what will you giue me now ile haue this fanne 
come dido leaue ascanius let vs walke 
vngentle queene is this thy loue to me 
and if my mother goe ile follow her 
iarbus dye seeing she abandons thee 
am i not king of rich getulia 
mother looke here 
i goe to feed the humour of my loue 
yet not from carthage for a thousand worlds 
doth dido call me backe 
then pull out both mine eyes or let me dye 
you shall not hurt my father when he comes 
that will æneas shewe your maiestie 
i vnderstand your highnesse sent for me 
so much haue i receiu d at female
hands 
as without blushing i can aske no more:
yet queene of affricke are my ships vnrigd 
my sailes all rent in sunder with the winde 
my oares broken and my tackling lost 
yea all my nauie split with rockes and shelfes:
nor sterne nor anchor haue our maimed fleete 
our masts the furious windes strooke ouer bourd:
which piteous wants if dido will supplie 
we will account her author of our liues 
wherefore would dido haue æneas stay 
i saw this man at troy ere troy was sackt 
i this in greece when paris stole faire helen 
this man and i were at olympus games 
i know this face he is a persian borne 
i traueld with him to ætolia 
and i in athens with this gentleman 
vnlesse i be deceiu d disputed once 
no madame but it seemes that these are kings 
o happie shall he be whom dido loues 
vngentle can she wrong iarbus so 
ile dye before a stranger haue that grace:
we two will talke alone what words be these 
but loue and duetie led him on perhaps 
to presse beyond acceptance to your sight 
why man of troy doe i offend thine eyes 
or art thou grieude thy betters presse so nye 
women may wrong by priuiledge of loue:
but should that man of men  dido except  
haue taunted me in these opprobrious termes 
i would haue either drunke his dying bloud 
or els i would haue giuen my life in gage 
i mother i shall one day be a man 
and better able vnto other armes 
meane time these wanton weapons serue my warre 
which i will breake betwixt a lyons iawes 
i and outface him to doe what he can 
and mought i liue to see him sacke rich thebes 
and loade his speare with grecian princes heads 
then would i wish me with anchises tombe 
and dead to honour that hath brought me vp 
and might i liue to see thee shipt away 
and hoyst aloft on neptunes hideous hilles 
then would i wish me in faire female
armes 
and dead to scorne that hath pursued me so 
stoute friend achates doest thou know this wood 
as i remember here you shot the deere 
that sau d your famisht souldiers liues from death 
when first you set your foote vpon the shoare 
and here we met fair venus virgine like 
bearing her bowe and quiuer at her backe 
o how these irksome labours now delight 
and ouerioy my thoughts with their escape:
who would not vndergoe all kind of toyle 
to be well stor d with such a winters tale 
i this it is which wounds me to the death 
to see a phrigian far fet to the sea 
preferd before a man of maiestie:
o loue o hate o cruell womens hearts 
that imitate the moone in euery chaunge 
and like the planets euer loue to raunge:
what shall i doe thus wronged with disdaine 
reuenge me on æneas or on her:
on her fond man that were to warre gainst heauen 
and with one shaft prouoke ten thousand darts:
this troians end will be thy enuies aime 
whose bloud will reconcile thee to content 
and make loue drunken with thy sweete desire:
but dido that now holdeth him so deare 
will dye with very tidings of his death:
but time will discontinue her content 
and mould her minde vnto newe fancies shapes:
o god of heauen turne the hand of fate
vnto that happie day of my delight 
and then what then iarbus shall but loue:
so doth he now though not with equall gaine 
that resteth in the riuall of thy paine 
who nere will cease to soare till he be slaine 
dido
by chance sweete queene as mars and venus met 
why what is it that dido may desire
and not obtaine be it in humaine power 
it is not ought æneas may achieue 
what hath iarbus angred her in ought 
and will she be auenged on his life 
who then of all so cruell may he be 
that should detaine thy eye in his defects 
what ailes my queene is she falne sicke of late 
what meanes faire dido by this doubtfull speech 
æneas thoughts dare not ascend so high
as female
heart which monarkes might not scale 
if that your maiestie can looke so lowe 
as my despised worths that shun all praise 
with this my hand i giue to you my heart 
and vow by all the gods of hospitalitie 
by heauen and earth and my faire brothers bowe 
by paphos capys and the purple sea 
from whence my radiant mother did descend 
and by this sword that saued me from the greekes 
neuer to leaue these newe vpreared walles 
whiles dido liues and rules in iunos towne 
neuer to like or loue any but her 
did euer men see such a sudden storme 
or day so cleere so suddenly orecast 
i thinke some fell inchantresse dwelleth here 
that can call them forth when as she please 
and diue into blacke tempests treasurie 
when as she mcanes to maske the world with clowdes 
i thinke it was the diuels reuelling night 
there was such hurly burly in the heauens:
doubtles apollos axeltree is crackt 
or aged atlas shoulder out of ioynt 
the motion was soouer violent 
in all this coyle where haue ye left the queene 
nay where is my warlike father can you tell 
come forth the caue: can heauen endure this sight 
iarbus curse that vnreuenging ioue 
whose flintie darts slept in tiphous den 
whiles these adulterers surfetted with sinne:
nature why mad st me not some poysonous beast 
that with the sharpnes of my edged sting 
i might haue stakte them both vnto the earth 
whil st they were sporting in this darksome caue 
the ayre is cleere and southerne windes are whist 
come dido let vs hasten to the towne 
since gloomie æolus doth cease to frowne 
faire anna how escapt you from the shower 
not with æneas in the vgly caue 
come seruants come bring forth the sacrifize 
that i may pacifie that gloomie ioue 
whose emptie altars haue enlarg d our illes 
eternall ioue great master of the clowdes 
father of gladnesse and all frollicke thoughts 
that with thy gloomie hand corrects the heauen 
when ayrie creatures warre amongst themselues:
heare heare o heare iarbus plaining prayers 
whose hideous ecchoes make the welkin howle 
and all the woods eliza to resound:
the woman that thou wild vs entertaine 
where straying in our borders vp and downe 
she crau d a hide of ground to build a towne 
with whom we did deuide both lawes and land 
and all the fruites that plentie els sends forth 
scorning our loues and royall marriage rites 
yeelds vp her beautie to a strangers bed 
who hauing wrought her shame is straight way fled:
now if thou beest a pitying god of power 
on whom ruth and compassion euer waites 
redresse these wrongs and warne him to his ships 
that now afflicts me with his flattering eyes 
i anna is there ought you would with me 
anna against this troian doe i pray 
who seekes to rob me of thy sisters loue 
and dive into her heart by coloured lookes 
mine eye is fixt where fancie cannot start 
o leaue me leaue me to my silent thoughts 
that register the numbers of my ruth 
and i will either moue the thoughtles flint 
or drop out both mine eyes in drisling teares 
before my sorrowes tide haue any stint 
i may nor will list to such loathsome chaunge 
that intercepts the course of my desire:
seruants come fetch these emptie vessels here 
for i will flye from these alluring eyes 
that doe pursue my peace where ere it goes 
carthage my friendly host adue 
since destinie doth call me from the shoare:
hermes this night descending in a dreame 
hath summond me to fruitfull italy:
ioue wils it so my mother wils it so:
let my phenissa graunt and then i goe:
graunt she or no æneas must away 
whose golden fortunes clogd with courtly ease 
cannot ascend to fames immortall house 
or banquet in bright honors burnisht hall 
till he hath furrowed neptunes glassie fieldes 
and cut a passage through his toples hilles:
achates come forth sergestus illioneus 
cloanthus haste away æneas calles 
what willes our lord or wherefore did he call 
the dreames  braue mates  that did beset my bed 
when sleepe but newly had imbrast the night 
commaunds me leaue these vnrenowmed beames 
whereas nobilitie abhors to stay 
and none but base æneas will abide:
abourd abourd since fates doe bid abourd 
and slice the sea with sable coloured ships 
on whom the nimble windes may all day waight 
and follow them as footemen through the deepe:
yet dido casts her eyes like anchors out 
to stay my fleete from loosing forth the bay:
come backe come backe i heare her crye a farre 
and let me linke my bodie to my lips 
that tyed together by the striuing tongues 
we may as one saile into italy 
banish that ticing dame from forth your mouth 
and follow your foreseeing starres in all 
this is no life for men at armes to liue 
where daliance doth consume a souldiers strength 
and wanton motions of alluring eyes 
effeminate our mindes inur d to warre 
why let vs build a citie of our owne 
and not stand lingering here for amorous lookes:
will dido raise old priam forth his graue 
and build the towne againe the greekes did burne 
no no she cares not how we sinke or swimme 
so she may haue æneas in her armes 
to italy sweete friends to italy 
we will not stay a minute longer here 
troians abourd and i will follow you 
i faine would goe yet beautie calles me backe:
to leaue her so and not once say farewell 
were to transgresse against all lawes of loue:
but if i vse such ceremonious thankes 
as parting friends accustome on the shoare 
her siluer armes will coll me round about 
and teares of pearle crye stay æneas stay:
each word she sayes will then containe a crowne 
and euery speech be ended with a kisse:
i may not dure this female drudgerie 
to sea æneas finde out italy 
o princely dido giue me leaue to speake 
i went to take my farewell achates 
because i feard your grace would keepe me here 
then let æneas goe abourd with vs 
the sea is rough the windes blow to the shoare 
hath not the carthage queene mine onely sonne 
thinkes dido i will goe and leaue him here 
this kisse shall be faire female
punishment 
how vaine am i to weare this diadem 
and beare this golden scepter in my hand 
a burgonet of steele and not a crowne 
a sword and not a scepter fits æneas 
o dido patronesse of all our liues 
when i leaue thee death be my punishment 
swell raging seas frowne wayward destinies 
blow windes threaten ye rockes and sandie shelfes 
this is the harbour that æneas seekes 
lets see what tempests can anoy me now 
æneas for his parentage deserues
as large a kingdome as is libia 
i and vnlesse the destinies be false 
i shall be planted in as rich a land 
then here in me shall flourish priams race 
and thou and i achates for reuenge 
for troy for priam for his fiftie sonnes 
our kinsmens loues and thousand guiltles soules 
will leade an hoste against the hatefull greekes 
and fire proude lacedemon ore their heads 
whither must i goe ile stay with my mother 
come come ile goe how farre hence is your house 
nurse i am wearie will you carrie me 
so youle loue me i care not if i doe 
a husband and no teeth 
come nurse 
triumph my mates our trauels are at end 
here will æneas build a statelier troy 
then that which grim atrides ouerthrew:
carthage shall vaunt her pettie walles no more 
for i will grace them with a fairer frame 
and clad her in a chrystall liuerie 
wherein the day may euermore delight:
from golden india ganges will i fetch 
whose wealthie streames may waite vpon her towers 
and triple wise intrench her round about:
the sunne from egypt shall rich odors bring 
wherewith his burning beames like labouring bees 
that loade their thighes with hyblas honeys spoyles 
shall here vnburden their exhaled sweetes 
and plant our pleasant suburbes with her fumes 
what length or bredth shal this braue towne cōtaine 
not past foure thousand paces at the most 
but what shall it be calde troy as before 
that haue i not determinde with my selfe 
let it be term d ænea by your name 
rather ascania by your little sonne 
nay i will haue it calde anchisaon 
of my old fathers name 
æneas stay ioues herald bids thee stay 
whom doe i see ioues winged messenger 
welcome to carthage new erected towne 
why cosin stand you building cities here 
and beautifying the empire of this queene 
while italy is cleane out of thy minde 
to too forgetfull of thine owne affayres 
why wilt thou so betray thy sonnes good hap 
the king of gods sent me from highest heauen 
to sound this angrie message in thine eares 
vaine man what monarky expectst thou here 
or with what thought sleepst thou in libia shoare 
if that all glorie hath forsaken thee 
and thou despise the praise of such attempts:
yet thinke vpon ascanius prophesie 
and yong iulus more then thousand yeares 
whom i haue brought from ida where he slept 
and bore yong cupid vnto cypresse ile 
this was my mother that beguild the queene 
and made me take my brother for my sonne:
no maruell dido though thou be in loue 
that daylie danlest cupid in thy armes:
welcome sweet child where hast thou been this long 
eating sweet comfites with queene female
maide 
who euer since hath luld me in her armes 
sergestus beare him hence vnto our ships 
lest dido spying him keepe him for a pledge 
spendst thou thy time about this little boy 
and giuest not care vnto the charge i bring 
i tell thee thou must straight to italy 
or els abide the wrath of frowning ioue 
how should i put into the raging deepe 
who haue no sailes nor tackling for my ships 
what would the gods haue me deucalion like 
flote vp and downe where ere the billowes driue 
though she repairde my fleete and gaue me ships 
yet hath she tane away my oares and masts 
and left me neither saile nor sterne abourd 
how now æneas sad what meanes these dumpes 
iarbus i am cleane besides my selfe 
ioue hath heapt on me such a desperate charge 
which neither art nor reason may atchieue 
nor i deuise by what meanes to contriue 
as how i pray may i entreat you tell 
with speede he bids me sail to italy 
when as i want both rigging for my fleete 
and also furniture for these my men 
if that be all then cheare thy drooping lookes 
for i will furnish thee with such supplies:
let some of those thy followers goe with me 
and they shall haue what thing so ere thou needst 
thankes good iarbus for thy friendly ayde 
achates and the rest shall waite on thee 
whil st i rest thankfull for this curtesie 
now will i haste vnto lauinian shoare 
and raise a new foundation to old troy 
witnes the gods and witnes heauen and earth 
how loth i am to leaue these libian bounds 
but that eternall iupiter commands 
o pardon me if i resolue thee why:
æneas will not faine with his deare loue 
i must from hence: this day swift mercury
when i was laying a platforme for these walles 
sent from his father ioue appeard to me 
and in his name rebukt me bitterly 
for lingering here neglecting italy 
i am commaunded by immortal ioue 
to leaue this towne and passe to italy 
and therefore must of force 
not from my heart for i can hardly goe 
and yet i may not stay dido farewell 
then let me goe and neuer say farewell 
let me goe farewell i must from hence 
o queene of carthage wert thou vgly blacke 
æneas could not choose but hold thee deare 
yet must he not gainsay the gods behest 
desine meque tuis incendere teque querelis 
italiam non sponte sequor 
in vaine my loue thou spendst thy fainting breath 
if words might moue me i were ouercome 
how long will dido mourne a strangers flight 
that hath dishonord her and carthage both 
how long shall i with griefe consume my daies 
and reape no guerdon for my truest loue 
but afterwards will dido graunt me loue 
cursed iarbus dye to expiate
the griefe that tires vpon thine inward soule 
dido i come to thee aye me æneas
