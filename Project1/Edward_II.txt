MALE
My father is deceas'd.  Come, Gaveston,
And share the kingdom with thy dearest friend.
Ah, words that make me surfeit with delight!
What greater bliss can hap to Gaveston
Than live and be the favourite of a king!
Sweet prince, I come! these, thy amorous lines
Might have enforc'd me to have swum from France,
And, like Leander, gasp'd upon the sand,
So thou wouldst smile, and take me in thine arms.
The sight of London to my exil'd eyes
Is as Elysium to a new-come soul:
Not that I love the city or the men,
But that it harbours him I hold so dear,--
The king, upon whose bosom let me lie,
And with the world be still at enmity.
What need the arctic people love star-light,
To whom the sun shines both by day and night?
Farewell base stooping to the lordly peers!
My knee shall bow to none but to the king.
As for the multitude, that are but sparks,
Rak'd up in embers of their poverty,--
Tanti,--I'll fawn first on the wind,
That glanceth at my lips, and flieth away.

But how now! what are these?
MALE
 Such as desire your worship's service.
MALE
 What canst thou do?
MALE
I can ride.
MALE
 But I have no horse.--What art thou?
MALE
A traveller.
MALE
 Let me see; thou wouldst do well
To wait at my trencher, and tell me lies at dinner-time;
And, as I like your discoursing, I'll have you.--
And what art thou?
MALE
A soldier, that hath serv'd against the Scot.
MALE
 Why, there are hospitals for such as you:
I have no war; and therefore, sir, be gone.
MALE
Farewell, and perish by a soldier's hand,
That wouldst reward them with an hospital!
MALE
 Ay, ay, these words of his move me as much
As if a goose should play the porcupine,
And dart her plumes, thinking to pierce my breast.
But yet it is no pain to speak men fair;
I'll flatter these, and make them live in hope.--
You know that I came lately out of France,
And yet I have not view'd my lord the king:
If I speed well, I'll entertain you all.
MALE
We thank your worship.
MALE
 I have some business: leave me to myself.
MALE
We will wait here about the court.
MALE
 Do.  
These are not men for me;
I must have wanton poets, pleasant wits,
Musicians, that with touching of a string
May draw the pliant king which way I please:
Music and poetry is his delight;
Therefore I'll have Italian masks by night,
Sweet speeches, comedies, and pleasing shows;
And in the day, when he shall walk abroad,
Like sylvan nymphs my pages shall be clad;
My men, like satyrs grazing on the lawns,
Shall with their goat-feet dance the antic hay;
Sometime a lovely boy in Dian's shape,
With hair that gilds the water as it glides
Crownets of pearl about his naked arms,
And in his sportful hands an olive-tree,
To hide those parts which men delight to see,
Shall bathe him in a spring; and there, hard by,
One like Actæon, peeping through the grove,
Shall by the angry goddess be transform'd,
And running in the likeness of an hart,
By yelping hounds pull'd down, shall semm to die:
Such things as these best please his majesty.--
Here comes my lord the king, and the nobles,
From the parliament.  I'll stand aside.  
MALE
Lancaster!
MALE
My lord?
MALE
 That Earl of Lancaster do I abhor.  
MALE
Will you not grant me this?--In spite of them
I'll have my will; and these two Mortimers,
That cross me thus, shall know I am displeased.  
MALE
If you love us, my lord, hate Gaveston.
MALE
 That villain Mortimer! I'll be his death. 
MALE
Mine uncle here, this earl, and I myself,
Were sworn to your father at his death,
That he should ne'er return into the realm:
And now, my lord, ere I will break my oath,
This sword of mine, that should offend your foes,
Shall sleep within the scabbard at thy need,
And underneath thy banners march who will,
For Mortimer will hang his armour up.
MALE
 Mort dieu!  
MALE
Well, Mortimer, I'll make thee rue these words:
Beseems it thee to contradict thy king?
Frown'st thou thereat, aspiring Lancaster?
The sword shall plane the furrows of thy brows,
And hew these knees that now are grown so stiff.
I will have Gaveston; and you shall know
What danger 'tis to stand against your king.
MALE
 Well done, Ned!
MALE
My lord, why do you thus incense your peers,
That naturally would love and honour you,
But for that base and obscure Gaveston?
Four earldoms have I, besides Lancaster,--
Derby, Salisbury, Lincoln, Leicester;
These will I sell, to give my soldiers pay,
Ere Gaveston shall stay within the realm:
Therefore, if he be come, expel him straight.
MALE
Barons and earls, your pride hath made me mute;
But know I'll speak, and to the proof, I hope.
I do remember, in my father's days,
Lord Percy of the North, being highly mov'd,
Brav'd Mowbray in presence of the king;
For which, had not his highness lov'd him well,
He should have lost his head; but with his look
Th' undaunted spirit of Percy was appeas'd,
And Mowbray and he were reconcil'd:
Yet dare you brave the king unto his face.--
Brother, revenge it, and let these their heads
Preach upon poles, for trespass of their tongues.
MALE
O, our heads!
MALE
Ay, yours; and therefore I would wish you grant.
MALE
Bridle thy anger, gentle Mortimer.
MALE
I cannot, nor I will not; I must speak.--
Cousin, our hands I hope shall fence our heads,
And strike off his that makes you threaten us.--
Come, uncle, let us leave the brain-sick king,
And henceforth parley with our naked swords.
MALE
Wiltshire hath men enough to save our heads.
MALE
All Warwickshire will leave him for my sake.
MALE
And northward Lancaster hath many friends.--
Adieu, my lord; and either change your mind,
Or look to see the throne, where you should sit,
To float in blood, and at thy wanton head
The glozing head of thy base minion thrown.
MALE
I cannot brook these haughty menaces:
Am I a king, and must be over-rul'd!--
Brother, display my ensigns in the field:
I'll bandy with the barons and the earls,
And either die or live with Gaveston.
MALE
 I can no longer keep me from my lord.
MALE
What, Gaveston! welcome!  Kiss not my hand:
Embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee.
Why shouldst thou kneel? know'st thou not who I am?
Thy friend, thyself, another Gaveston:
Not Hylas was more mourned for of Hercules
Than thou hast been of me since thy exile.
MALE
 And, since I went from hence, no soul in hell
Hath felt more torment than poor Gaveston.
MALE
I know it.--Brother, welcome home my friend.--
Now let the treacherous Mortimers conspire,
And that high-minded Earl of Lancaster:
I have my wish, in that I joy thy sight;
And sooner shall the sea o'erwhelm my land
Than bear the ship that shall transport thee hence.
I here create thee Lord High-chamberlain,
Chief Secretary to the state and me,
Earl of Cornwall, King and Lord of Man.
MALE
 My lord, these titles far exceed my worth.
MALE
Brother, the least of these may well suffice
For one of greater birth than Gaveston.
MALE
Cease, brother, for I cannot brook these words.--
Thy worth, sweet friend, is far above my gifts:
Therefore, to equal it, receive my heart.
If for these dignities thou be envied,
I'll give thee more; for, but to honour thee,
Is Edward pleas'd with kingly regiment.
Fear'st thou thy person? thou shalt have a guard:
Wantest thou gold? go to my treasury:
Wouldst thou be lov'd and fear'd? receive my seal,
Save or condemn, and in our name command
What so thy mind affects, or fancy likes.
MALE
 It shall suffice me to enjoy your love;
Which whiles I have, I think myself as great
As Cæsar riding in the Roman street,
With captive kings at his triumphant car.


MALE
Whither goes my Lord of Coventry so fast?
MALE
To celebrate your father's exequies.
But is that wicked Gaveston return'd?
MALE
Ay, priest, and lives to be reveng'd on thee,
That wert the only cause of his exile.
MALE
 'Tis true; and, but for reverence of these robes,
Thou shouldst not plod one foot beyond this place.
MALE
I did no more than I was bound to do:
And, Gaveston, unless thou be reclaim'd,
As then I did incense the parliament,
So will I now, and thou shalt back to France.
MALE
 Saving your reverence, you must pardon me.
MALE
Throw off his golden mitre, rend his stole,
And in the channel christen him anew.
MALE
Ay, brother, lay not violent hands on him!
For he'll complain unto the see of Rome.
MALE
 Let him complain unto the see of hell:
I'll be reveng'd on him for my exile.
MALE
No, spare his life, but seize upon his goods:
Be thou lord bishop, and receive his rents,
And make him serve thee as thy chaplain:
I give him thee; here, use him as thou wilt.
MALE
 He shall to prison, and there die in bolts.
MALE
Ay, to the Tower, the Fleet, or where thou wilt.
MALE
For this offence be thou accurs'd of God!
MALE
Who's there?  Convey this priest to the Tower.
MALE
True, true.
MALE
But, in the meantime, Gaveston, away,
And take possession of his house and goods.
Come, follow me, and thou shalt have my guard
To see it done, and bring thee safe again.
MALE
 What should a priest do with so fair a house?
A prison may beseem his holiness.


MALE
'Tis true, the bishop is in the Tower,
And goods and body given to Gaveston.
MALE
What, will they tyrannise upon the church?
Ah, wicked King! accursed Gaveston!
This ground, which is corrupted with their steps,
Shall be their timeless sepulchre or mine.
MALE
Well, let that peevish Frenchman guard him sure;
Unless his breast be sword-proof, he shall die.
MALE
How now! why droops the Earl of Lancaster?
MALE
Wherefore is Guy of Warwick discontent?
MALE
That villain Gaveston is made an earl.
MALE
An earl!
MALE
Ay, and besides Lord-chamberlain of the realm,
And Secretary too, and Lord of Man.
MALE
We may not nor we will not suffer this.
MALE
Why post we not from hence to levy men?
MALE
"My Lord of Cornwall" now at every word;
And happy is the man whom he vouchsafes,
For vailing of his bonnet, one good look.
Thus, arm in arm, the king and he doth march:
Nay, more, the guard upon his lordship waits,
And all the court begins to flatter him.
MALE
Thus leaning on the shoulder of the king,
He nods, and scorns, and smiles at those that pass.
MALE
Doth no man take exceptions at the slave?
MALE
All stomach him, but none dare speak a word.
MALE
Ah, that bewrays their baseness, Lancaster!
Were all the earls and barons of my mind,
We'd hale him from the bosom of the king,
And at the court-gate hang the peasant up,
Who, swoln with venom of ambitious pride,
Will be the ruin of the realm and us.
MALE
Here comes my Lord of Canterbury's grace.
MALE
His countenance bewrays he is displeas'd.


MALE
First, were his sacred garments rent and torn;
Then laid they violent hands upon him; next,
Himself imprison'd, and his goods asseiz'd:
This certify the Pope: away, take horse.
MALE
My lord, will you take arms against the king?
MALE
What need I?  God himself is up in arms
When violence is offer'd to the church.
MALE
Then will you join with us, that be his peers,
To banish or behead that Gaveston?
MALE
What else, my lords? for it concerns me near;
The bishoprick of Coventry is his.

MALE
Madam, whither walks your majesty so fast?
FEMALE
Unto the forest, gentle Mortimer,
To live in grief and baleful discontent;
For now my lord the king regards me not,
But dotes upon the love of Gaveston:
He claps his cheeks, and hangs about his neck,
Smiles in his face, and whispers in his ears;
And, when I come, he frowns, as who should say,
"Go whither thou wilt, seeing I have Gaveston."
MALE
Is it not strange that he is thus bewitch'd?
MALE
Madam, return unto the court again:
That sly inveigling Frenchman we'll exile,
Or lose our lives; and yet, ere that day come,
The king shall lose his crown; for we have power,
And courage too, to be reveng'd at full.
MALE
But yet lift not your swords against the king.
MALE
No; but we will lift Gaveston from hence.
MALE
And war must be the means, or he'll stay still.
FEMALE
Then let him stay; for, rather than my lord
Shall be oppress'd with civil mutinies,
I will endure a melancholy life,
And let him frolic with his minion.
MALE
My lords, to ease all this, but hear me speak:
We and the rest, that are his counsellors,
Will meet, and with a general consent
Confirm his banishment with our hands and seals.
MALE
What we confirm the king will frustrate.
MALE
Then may we lawfully revolt from him.
MALE
But say, my lord, where shall this meeting be?
MALE
At the New Temple.
MALE
Content.
MALE
And, in the meantime, I'll entreat you all
To cross to Lambeth, and there stay with me.
MALE
Come, then, let's away.
MALE
Madam, farewell.
FEMALE
Farewell, sweet Mortimer, and, for my sake,
Forbear to levy arms against the king.
MALE
Ay, if words will serve; if not, I must. 

MALE
 Edmund, the mighty prince of Lancaster,
That hath more earldoms than an ass can bear,
And both the Mortimers, two goodly men,
With Guy of Warwick, that redoubted knight,
Are gone towards Lambeth: there let them remain.  

MALE
Here is the form of Gaveston's exile;
May it please your lordship to subscribe your name.
MALE
Give me the paper.
 
MALE
Quick, quick, my lord; I long to write my name.
MALE
But I long more to see him banish'd hence.
MALE
The name of Mortimer shall fright the king,
Unless he be declin'd from that base peasant.

MALE
What, are you mov'd that Gaveston sits here?
It is our pleasure; we will have it so.
MALE
Your grace doth well to place him by your side,
For nowhere else the new earl is so safe.
MALE
What man of noble birth can brook this sight?
See, what a scornful look the peasant casts!
MALE
Can kingly lions fawn on creeping ants?
MALE
Ignoble vassal, that, like Phaeton,
Aspir'st unto the guidance of the sun!
MALE
Their downfall is at hand, their forces down:
We will not thus be fac'd and over-peer'd.
MALE
Lay hands on that traitor Mortimer!
MALE
Lay hands on that traitor Gaveston!
MALE
Is this the duty that you owe your king?
MALE
We know our duties; let him know his peers.
MALE
Whither will you bear him? stay, or ye shall die.
MALE
We are no traitors; therefore threaten not.
MALE
 No, threaten not, my lord, but pay them home.
Were I a king--
MALE
Thou, villain! wherefore talk'st thou of a king,
That hardly art a gentleman by birth?
MALE
Were he a peasant, being my minion,
I'll make the proudest of you stoop to him.
MALE
My lord--you may not thus disparage us.--
Away, I say, with hateful Gaveston!
MALE
And with the Earl of Kent that favours him.
  
MALE
Nay, then, lay violent hands upon your king:
Here, Mortimer, sit thou in Edward's throne;
Warwick and Lancaster, wear you my crown.
Was ever king thus over-rul'd as I?
MALE
Learn, then, to rule us better, and the realm.
MALE
What we have done, our heart-blood shall maintain.
MALE
Think you that we can brook this upstart['s] pride?
MALE
Anger and wrathful fury stops my speech.
MALE
Why are you not mov'd? be patient, my lord,
And see what we your counsellors have done.
MALE
My lords, now let us all be resolute,
And either have our wills, or lose our lives.
MALE
Meet you for this, proud over-daring peers!
Ere my sweet Gaveston shall part from me,
This isle shall fleet upon the ocean,
And wander to the unfrequented Inde.
MALE
You know that I am legate to the Pope:
On your allegiance to the see of Rome,
Subscribe, as we have done, to his exile.
MALE
Curse him, if he refuse; and then may we
Depose him, and elect another king.
MALE
Ay, there it goes! but yet I will not yield:
Curse me, depose me, do the worst you can.
MALE
Then linger not, my lord, but do it straight.
MALE
Remember how the bishop was abus'd:
Either banish him that was the cause thereof,
Or I will presently discharge these lords
Of duty and allegiance due to thee.
MALE
It boots me not to threat; I must speak fair:
The legate of the Pope will be obey'd.--
My lord, you shall be Chancellor of the realm;
Thou, Lancaster, High-Admiral of our fleet;
Young Mortimer and his uncle shall be earls;
And you, Lord Warwick, President of the North;
And thou of Wales.  If this content you not,
Make several kingdoms of this monarchy,
And share it equally amongst you all,
So I may have some nook or corner left,
To frolic with my dearest Gaveston.
MALE
Nothing shall alter us; we are resolv'd.
MALE
Come, come, subscribe.
MALE
Why should you love him whom the world hates so?
MALE
Because he loves me more than all the world.
Ah, none but rude and savage-minded men
Would seek the ruin of my Gaveston!
You that be noble-born should pity him.
MALE
You that are princely-born should shake him off:
For shame, subscribe, and let the clown depart.
MALE
Urge him, my lord.
MALE
Are you content to banish him the realm?
MALE
I see I must, and therefore am content:
Instead of ink, I'll write it with my tears.
MALE
The king is love-sick for his minion.
MALE
'Tis done: and now, accursed hand, fall off!
MALE
Give it me: I'll have it publish'd in the streets.
MALE
I'll see him presently despatch'd away.
MALE
Now is my heart at ease.
MALE
And so is mine.
MALE
This will be good news to the common sort.
MALE
Be it or no, he shall not linger here.
 
MALE
How fast they run to banish him I love!
They would not stir, were it to do me good.
Why should a king be subject to a priest?
Proud Rome, that hatchest such imperial grooms,
With these thy superstitious taper-lights,
Wherewith thy antichristian churches blaze,
I'll fire thy crazed buildings, and enforce
The papal towers to kiss the lowly ground,
With slaughter'd priests make Tiber's channel swell,
And banks rais'd higher with their sepulchres!
As for the peers, that back the clergy thus,
If I be king, not one of them shall live.



MALE
 My lord, I hear it whisper'd everywhere,
That I am banish'd and must fly the land.
MALE
'Tis true, sweet Gaveston: O were it false!
The legate of the Pope will have it so,
And thou must hence, or I shall be depos'd.
But I will reign to be reveng'd of them;
And therefore, sweet friend, take it patiently.
Live where thou wilt, I'll send thee gold enough;
And long thou shalt not stay; or, if thou dost,
I'll come to thee; my love shall ne'er decline.
MALE
 Is all my hope turn'd to this hell of grief?
MALE
Rend not my heart with thy too-piercing words:
Thou from this land, I from myself am banish'd.
MALE
 To go from hence grieves not poor Gaveston;
But to forsake you, in whose gracious looks
The blessedness of Gaveston remains;
For nowhere else seeks he felicity.
MALE
And only this torments my wretched soul,
That, whether I will or no, thou must depart.
Be governor of Ireland in my stead,
And there abide till fortune call thee home.
Here, take my picture, and let me wear thine:
  
O, might I keep thee here, as I do this,
Happy were I! but now most miserable.
MALE
 'Tis something to be pitied of a king.
MALE
Thou shalt not hence; I'll hide thee, Gaveston.
MALE
 I shall be found, and then 'twill grieve me more.
MALE
Kind words and mutual talk makes our grief greater:
Therefore, with dumb embracement, let us part,
Stay, Gaveston; I cannot leave thee thus.
MALE
 For every look, my love drops down a tear:
Seeing I must go, do not renew my sorrow.
MALE
The time is little that thou hast to stay,
And, therefore, give me leave to look my fill.
But, come, sweet friend; I'll bear thee on thy way.
MALE
 The peers will frown.
MALE
I pass not for their anger.  Come, let's go:
O, that we might as well return as go!

FEMALE
Whither goes my lord?
MALE
Fawn not on me, French strumpet; get thee gone!
FEMALE
On whom but on my husband should I fawn?
MALE
 On Mortimer; with whom, ungentle queen,--
I judge no more--judge you the rest, my lord.
FEMALE
In saying this, thou wrong'st me, Gaveston:
Is't not enough that thou corrupt'st my lord,
And art a bawd to his affections,
But thou must call mine honour thus in question?
MALE
 I mean not so; your grace must pardon me.
MALE
Thou art too familiar with that Mortimer,
And by thy means is Gaveston exil'd:
But I would wish thee reconcile the lords,
Or thou shalt ne'er be reconcil'd to me.
FEMALE
Your highness knows, it lies not in my power.
MALE
Away, then! touch me not.--Come, Gaveston.
FEMALE
Villain, 'tis thou that robb'st me of my lord.
MALE
 Madam, 'tis you that rob me of my lord.
MALE
Speak not unto her: let her droop and pine.
FEMALE
Wherein, my lord, have I deserv'd these words?
Witness the tears that Isabella sheds,
Witness this heart, that, sighing for thee, breaks,
How dear my lord is to poor Isabel!
MALE
And witness heaven how dear thou art to me:
There weep; for, till my Gaveston be repeal'd,
Assure thyself thou com'st not in my sight.
  
FEMALE
O miserable and distressed queen!
Would, when I left sweet France, and was embarked,
That charming Circe, walking on the waves,
Had chang'd my shape! or at the marriage-day
The cup of Hymen had been full of poison!
Or with those arms, that twin'd about my neck,
I had been stifled, and not liv'd to see
The king my lord thus to abandon me!
Like frantic Juno, will I fill the earth
With ghastly murmur of my sighs and cries;
For never doted Jove on Ganymede
So much as he on cursed Gaveston:
But that will more exasperate his wrath;
I must entreat him, I must speak him fair,
And be a means to call home Gaveston:
And yet he'll ever dote on Gaveston;
And so am I for ever miserable.

MALE
Look, where the sister of the king of France
Sits wringing of her hands and beats her breast!
MALE
The king, I fear, hath ill-treated her.
MALE
Hard is the heart that injures such a saint.
MALE
I know 'tis 'long of Gaveston she weeps.
MALE
Why, he is gone.
MALE
Madam, how fares your grace?
FEMALE
Ah, Mortimer, now breaks the king's hate forth,
And he confesseth that he loves me not!
MALE
Cry quittance, madam, then, and love not him.
FEMALE
No, rather will I die a thousand deaths:
And yet I love in vain; he'll ne'er love me.
MALE
Fear ye not, madam; now his minion's gone,
His wanton humour will be quickly left.
FEMALE
O, never, Lancaster! I am enjoin'd,
To sue unto you all for his repeal:
This wills my lord, and this must I perform,
Or else be banish'd from his highness' presence.
MALE
For his repeal, madam! he comes not back,
Unless the sea cast up his shipwreck'd body.
MALE
And to behold so sweet a sight as that,
There's none here but would run his horse to death.
MALE
But, madam, would you have us call him home?
FEMALE
Ay, Mortimer, for, till he be restor'd,
The angry king hath banish'd me the court;
And, therefore, as thou lov'st and tender'st me,
Be thou my advocate unto these peers.
MALE
What, would you have me plead for Gaveston?
MALE
Plead for him that will, I am resolv'd.
MALE
And so am I, my lord: dissuade the queen.
FEMALE
O, Lancaster, let him dissuade the king!
For 'tis against my will he should return.
MALE
Then speak not for him; let the peasant go.
FEMALE
'Tis for myself I speak, and not for him.
MALE
No speaking will prevail; and therefore cease.
MALE
Fair queen, forbear to angle for the fish
Which, being caught, strikes him that takes it dead;
I mean that vile torpedo, Gaveston,
That now, I hope, floats on the Irish seas.
FEMALE
Sweet Mortimer, sit down by me a while,
And I will tell thee reasons of such weight
As thou wilt soon subscribe to his repeal.
MALE
It is impossible: but speak your mind.
FEMALE
Then, thus;--but none shall hear it but ourselves.
  
MALE
My lords, albeit the queen win Mortimer,
Will you be resolute and hold with me?
MALE
Not I, against my nephew.
MALE
Fear not; the queen's words cannot alter him.
MALE
No? do but mark how earnestly she pleads!
MALE
And see how coldly his looks make denial!
MALE
She smiles: now, for my life, his mind is chang'd!
MALE
I'll rather lose his friendship, I, than grant.
MALE
Well, of necessity it must be so.--
My lords, that I abhor base Gaveston
I hope your honours make no question.
And therefore, though I plead for his repeal,
'Tis not for his sake, but to our avail;
Nay, for the realm's behoof, and for the king's.
MALE
Fie, Mortimer, dishonour not thyself!
Can this be true, 'twas good to banish him?
And is this true, to call him home again?
Such reasons make white black, and dark night day.
MALE
My Lord of Lancaster, mark the respect.
MALE
In no respect can contraries be true.
FEMALE
Yet, good my lord, hear what he can allege.
MALE
All that he speaks is nothing; we are resolv'd.
MALE
Do you not wish that Gaveston were dead?
MALE
I would he were!
MALE
Why, then, my lord, give me but leave to speak.
MALE
But, nephew, do not play the sophister.
MALE
This which I urge is of a burning zeal
To mend the king and do our country good.
Know you not Gaveston hath store of gold,
Which may in Ireland purchase him such friends
As he will front the mightiest of us all?
And whereas he shall live and be belov'd,
'Tis hard for us to work his overthrow.
MALE
Mark you but that, my lord of Lancaster.
MALE
But, were he here, detested as he is,
How easily might some base slave be suborn'd
To greet his lordship with a poniard,
And none so much as blame the murderer,
But rather praise him for that brave attempt,
And in the chronicle enrol his name
For purging of the realm of such a plague!
MALE
He saith true.
MALE
Ay, but how chance this was not done before?
MALE
Because, my lords, it was not thought upon.
Nay, more, when he shall know it lies in us
To banish him, and then to call him home,
'Twill make him vail the top flag of his pride,
And fear to offend the meanest nobleman.
MALE
But how if he do not, nephew?
MALE
Then may we with some colour rise in arms;
For, howsoever we have borne it out,
'Tis treason to be up against the king;
So shall we have the people of our side,
Which, for his father's sake, lean to the king,
But cannot brook a night-grown mushroom,
Such a one as my Lord of Cornwall is,
Should bear us down of the nobility:
And, when the commons and the nobles join,
'Tis not the king can buckler Gaveston;
We'll pull him from the strongest hold he hath.
My lords, if to perform this I be slack,
Think me as base a groom as Gaveston.
MALE
On that condition Lancaster will grant.
MALE
And so will Pembroke and I.
MALE
And I.
MALE
In this I count me highly gratified,
And Mortimer will rest at your command.
FEMALE
And when this favour Isabel forgets,
Then let her live abandon'd and forlorn.--
But see, in happy time, my lord the king,
Having brought the Earl of Cornwall on his way,
Is new return'd.  This news will glad him much:
Yet not so much as me; I love him more
Than he can Gaveston: would he lov'd me
But half so much! then were I treble-blest.

MALE
He's gone, and for his absence thus I mourn:
Did never sorrow go so near my heart
As doth the want of my sweet Gaveston;
And, could my crown's revenue bring him back,
I would freely give it to his enemies,
And think I gain'd, having bought so dear a friend.
FEMALE
Hark, how he harps upon his minion!
MALE
My heart is as an anvil unto sorrow,
Which beats upon it like the Cyclops' hammers,
And with the noise turns up my giddy brain,
And makes me frantic for my Gaveston.
Ah, had some bloodless Fury rose from hell,
And with my kingly sceptre struck me dead,
When I was forc'd to leave my Gaveston!
MALE
Diablo, what passions call you these?
FEMALE
My gracious lord, I come to bring you news.
MALE
That you have parled with your Mortimer?
FEMALE
That Gaveston, my lord, shall be repeal'd.
MALE
Repeal'd! the news is too sweet to be true.
FEMALE
But will you love me, if you find it so?
MALE
If it be so, what will not Edward do?
FEMALE
For Gaveston, but not for Isabel.
MALE
For thee, fair queen, if thou lov'st Gaveston;
I'll hang a golden tongue about thy neck,
Seeing thou hast pleaded with so good success.
FEMALE
No other jewels hang about my neck
Than these, my lord; nor let me have more wealth
Than I may fetch from this rich treasury.
O, how a kiss revives poor Isabel!
MALE
Once more receive my hand; and let this be
A second marriage 'twixt thyself and me.
FEMALE
And may it prove more happy than the first!
My gentle lord, bespeak these nobles fair,
That wait attendance for a gracious look,
And on their knees salute your majesty.
MALE
Courageous Lancaster, embrace thy king;
And, as gross vapours perish by the sun,
Even so let hatred with thy sovereign's smile:
Live thou with me as my companion.
MALE
This salutation overjoys my heart.
MALE
Warwick shall be my chiefest counsellor:
These silver hairs will more adorn my court
Than gaudy silks or rich embroidery.
Chide me, sweet Warwick, if I go astray.
MALE
Slay me, my lord, when I offend your grace.
MALE
In solemn triumphs and in public shows
Pembroke shall bear the sword before the king.
MALE
And with this sword Pembroke will fight for you.
MALE
But wherefore walks young Mortimer aside?
Be thou commander of our royal fleet;
Or, if that lofty office like thee not,
I make thee here Lord Marshal of the realm.
MALE
My lord, I'll marshal so your enemies,
As England shall be quiet, and you safe.
MALE
And as for you, Lord Mortimer of Chirke,
Whose great achievements in our foreign war
Deserve no common place nor mean reward,
Be you the general of the levied troops
That now are ready to assail the Scots.
MALE
In this your grace hath highly honour'd me,
For with my nature war doth best agree.
FEMALE
Now is the king of England rich and strong,
Having the love of his renowmed peers.
MALE
Ay, Isabel, ne'er was my heart so light.--
Clerk of the crown, direct our warrant forth,
For Gaveston, to Ireland!
Beaumont, fly
As fast as Iris or Jove's Mercury.
MALE
It shall be done, my gracious lord. 
MALE
Lord Mortimer, we leave you to your charge.
Now let us in, and feast it royally.
Against our friend the Earl of Cornwall comes
We'll have a general tilt and tournament;
And then his marriage shall be solemnis'd;
For wot you not that I have made him sure
Unto our cousin, the Earl of Glocester's heir?
MALE
Such news we hear, my lord.
MALE
That day, if not for him, yet for my sake,
Who in the triumph will be challenger,
Spare for no cost; we will requite your love.
MALE
In this or aught your highness shall command us.
MALE
Thanks, gentle Warwick.  Come, lets in and revel.

younger Mortimer.
MALE
Nephew, I must to Scotland; thou stay'st here.
Leave now to oppose thyself against the king:
Thou seest by nature he is mild and calm;
And, seeing his mind so dotes on Gaveston,
Let him without controlment have his will.
The mightiest kings have had their minions;
Great Alexander lov'd Hephæstion,
The conquering Hercules for Hylas wept,
And for Patroclus stern Achilles droop'd
And not kings only, but the wisest men;
The Roman Tully lov'd Octavius,
Grave Socrates wild Alcibiades.
Then let his grace, whose youth is flexible,
And promiseth as much as we can wish,
Freely enjoy that vain light-headed earl;
For riper years will wean him from such toys.
MALE
Uncle, his wanton humour grieves not me;
But this I scorn, that one so basely-born
Should by his sovereign's favour grow so pert,
And riot it with the treasure of the realm,
While soldiers mutiny for want of pay.
He wears a lord's revenue on his back,
And, Midas-like, he jets it in the court,
With base outlandish cullions at his heels,
Whose proud fantastic liveries make such show
As if that Proteus, god of shapes, appear'd.
I have not seen a dapper Jack so brisk:
He wears a short Italian hooded cloak,
Larded with pearl, and in his Tuscan cap
A jewel of more value than the crown.
While others walk below, the king and he,
From out a window, laugh at such as we,
And flout our train, and jest at our attire.
Uncle, 'tis this that makes me impatient.
MALE
But, nephew, now you see the king is chang'd.
MALE
Then so I am, and live to do him service:
But, whiles I have a sword, a hand, a heart,
I will not yield to any such upstart.
You know my mind: come, uncle, let's away.

MALE
Spenser,
Seeing that our lord the Earl of Glocester's dead,
Which of the nobles dost thou mean to serve?
MALE
Not Mortimer, nor any of his side,
Because the king and he are enemies.
Baldock, learn this of me: a factious lord
Shall hardly do himself good, much less us;
But he that hath the favour of a king
May with one word advance us while we live.
The liberal Earl of Cornwall is the man
On whose good fortune Spenser's hope depends.
MALE
What, mean you, then, to be his follower?
MALE
No, his companion; for he loves me well,
And would have once preferr'd me to the king.
MALE
But he is banish'd; there's small hope of him.
MALE
Ay, for a while; but, Baldock, mark the end.
A friend of mine told me in secrecy
That he's repeal'd and sent for back again;
And even now a post came from the court
With letters to our lady from the king;
And, as she read, she smil'd; which makes me think
It is about her lover Gaveston.
MALE
'Tis like enough; for, since he was exil'd,
She neither walks abroad nor comes in sight.
But I had thought the match had been broke off,
And that his banishment had chang'd her mind.
MALE
Our lady's first love is not wavering;
My life for thine, she will have Gaveston.
MALE
Then hope I by her means to be preferr'd,
Having read unto her since she was a child.
MALE
Then, Baldock, you must cast the scholar off,
And learn to court it like a gentleman.
'Tis not a black coat and a little band,
A velvet-cap'd cloak, fac'd before with serge,
And smelling to a nosegay all the day,
Or holding of a napkin in your hand,
Or saying a long grace at a table's end,
Or making low legs to a nobleman,
Or looking downward, with your eye-lids close,
And saying, "Truly, an't may please your honour,"
Can get you any favour with great men:
You must be proud, bold, pleasant, resolute,
And now and then stab, as occasion serves.
MALE
Spenser, thou know'st I hate such formal toys,
And use them but of mere hypocrisy.
Mine old lord, whiles he liv'd, was so precise,
That he would take exceptions at my buttons,
And, being like pins' heads, blame me for the bigness;
Which made me curate-like in mine attire,
Though inwardly licentious enough,
And apt for any kind of villany.
I am none of these common pedants, I,
That cannot speak without propterea quod.
MALE
But one of those that saith quando-quidem,
And hath a special gift to form a verb.
MALE
Leave off this jesting; here my lady comes.

FEMALE
The grief for his exile was not so much
As is the joy of his returning home.
This letter came from my sweet Gaveston:
What need'st thou, love, thus to excuse thyself?
I know thou couldst not come and visit me. 
I will not long be from thee, though I die;--
This argues the entire love of my lord;--  
When I forsake thee, death seize on my heart!--
But stay thee here where Gaveston shall sleep.

Now to the letter of my lord the king:
He wills me to repair unto the court,
And meet my Gaveston: why do I stay,
Seeing that he talks thus of my marriage day?--
Who's there?  Baldock!
See that my coach be ready; I must hence.
MALE
It shall be done, madam.
FEMALE
And meet me at the park-pale presently 
Spenser, stay you, and bear me company,
For I have joyful news to tell thee of;
My lord of Cornwall is a-coming over,
And will be at the court as soon as we.
MALE
I knew the king would have him home again.
FEMALE
If all things sort out, as I hope they will,
Thy service, Spenser, shall be thought upon.
MALE
I humbly thank your ladyship.
FEMALE
Come, lead the way: I long till I am there.  

MALE
The wind is good; I wonder why he stays:
I fear me he is wreck'd upon the sea.
FEMALE
Look, Lancaster, how passionate he is,
And still his mind runs on his minion!
MALE
My lord,--
MALE
How now! what news? is Gaveston arriv'd?
MALE
Nothing but Gaveston! what means your grace?
You have matters of more weight to think upon:
The King of France sets foot in Normandy.
MALE
A trifle! we'll expel him when we please.
But tell me, Mortimer, what's thy device
Against the stately triumph we decreed?
MALE
A homely one, my lord, not worth the telling.
MALE
Pray thee, let me know it.
MALE
But, seeing you are so desirous, thus it is;
A lofty cedar tree, fair flourishing,
On whose top branches kingly eagles perch,
And by the bark a canker creeps me up,
And gets unto the highest bough of all;
The motto, Æque tandem.
MALE
And what is yours, my Lord of Lancaster?
MALE
My lord, mine's more obscure than Mortimer's.
Pliny reports, there is a flying-fish
Which all the other fishes deadly hate,
And therefore, being pursu'd, it takes the air:
No sooner is it up, but there's a fowl
That seizeth it: this fish, my lord, I bear;
The motto this, Undique mors est.
MALE
Proud Mortimer! ungentle Lancaster!
Is this the love you bear your sovereign?
Is this the fruit your reconcilement bears?
Can you in words make show of amity,
And in your shields display your rancorous minds?
What call you this but private libelling
Against the Earl of Cornwall and my brother?
FEMALE
Sweet husband, be content; they all love you.
MALE
They love me not that hate my Gaveston.
I am that cedar; shake me not too much;
And you the eagles; soar ye ne'er so high,
I have the jesses that will pull you down;
And Æque tandem shall that canker cry
Unto the proudest peer of Britainy.
Thou that compar'st him to a flying-fish,
And threaten'st death whether he rise or fall,
'Tis not the hugest monster of the sea,
Nor foulest harpy, that shall swallow him.
MALE
If in his absence thus he favours him,
What will he do whenas he shall be present?
MALE
That shall we see: look, where his lordship come!

MALE
My Gaveston!
Welcome to Tynmouth! welcome to thy friend!
Thy absence made me droop and pine away;
For, as the lovers of fair Danaë,
When she was lock'd up in a brazen tower,
Desir'd her more, and wax'd outrageous,
So did it fare with me: and now thy sight
Is sweeter far than was thy parting hence
Bitter and irksome to my sobbing heart.
MALE
 Sweet lord and king, your speech preventeth mine;
Yet have I words left to express my joy:
The shepherd, nipt with biting winter's rage,
Frolics not more to see the painted spring
Than I do to behold your majesty.
MALE
Will none of you salute my Gaveston?
MALE
Salute him! yes.--Welcome, Lord Chamberlain!
MALE
Welcome is the good Earl of Cornwall!
MALE
Welcome, Lord Governor of the Isle of Man!
MALE
Welcome, Master Secretary!
MALE
Brother, do you hear them?
MALE
Still will these earls and barons use me thus?
MALE
 My lord, I cannot brook these injuries.
FEMALE
Ay me, poor soul, when these begin to jar!  
MALE
Return it to their throats; I'll be thy warrant.
MALE
 Base, leaden earls, that glory in your birth,
Go sit at home, and eat your tenants' beef;
And come not here to scoff at Gaveston,
Whose mounting thoughts did never creep so low
As to bestow a look on such as you.
MALE
Yet I disdain not to do this for you.
 
MALE
Treason! treason! where's the traitor?
MALE
Here, here!
MALE
Convey hence Gaveston; they'll murder him.
MALE
 The life of thee shall salve this foul disgrace.
MALE
Villain, thy life! unless I miss mine aim.  
FEMALE
Ah, furious Mortimer, what hast thou done.
MALE
No more than I would answer, were he slain.
 
MALE
Yes, more than thou canst answer, though he live:
Dear shall you both abide this riotous deed:
Out of my presence! come not near the court.
MALE
I'll not be barr'd the court for Gaveston.
MALE
We'll hale him by the ears unto the block.
MALE
Look to your own heads; his is sure enough.
MALE
Look to your own crown, if you back him thus.
MALE
Warwick, these words do ill beseem thy years.
MALE
Nay, all of them conspire to cross me thus:
But, if I live, I'll tread upon their heads
That think with high looks thus to tread me down.
Come, Edmund, let's away, and levy men:
'Tis war that must abate these barons' pride.
 
MALE
Let's to our castles, for the king is mov'd.
MALE
Mov'd may he be, and perish in his wrath!
MALE
Cousin, it is no dealing with him now;
He means to make us stoop by force of arms:
And therefore let us jointly here protest
To prosecute that Gaveston to the death.
MALE
By heaven, the abject villain shall not live!
MALE
I'll have his blood, or die in seeking it.
MALE
The like oath Pembroke takes.
MALE
And so doth Lancaster.
Now send our heralds to defy the king;
And make the people swear to put him down.

MALE
Letters! from whence?
MALE
From Scotland, my lord. 
MALE
Why, how now, cousin! how fare all our friends?
MALE
My uncle's taken prisoner by the Scots.
MALE
We'll have him ransom'd, man: be of good cheer.
MALE
They rate his ransom at five thousand pound.
Who should defray the money but the king,
Seeing he is taken prisoner in his wars?
I'll to the king.
MALE
Do, cousin, and I'll bear thee company.
MALE
Meantime my Lord of Pembroke and myself
Will to Newcastle here, and gather head.
MALE
About it, then, and we will follow you.
MALE
Be resolute and full of secrecy.
MALE
I warrant you.
MALE
Cousin, an if he will not ransom him,
I'll thunder such a peal into his ears
As never subject did unto his king.
MALE
Content; I'll bear my part.--Hollo! who's there?


MALE
Ay, marry, such a guard as this doth well.
MALE
Lead on the way.
MALE
Whither will your lordships?
MALE
Whither else but to the king?
MALE
His highness is dispos'd to be alone.
MALE
Why, so he may; but we will speak to him.
MALE
You may not in, my lord.
MALE
May we not?


MALE
How now!
What noise is this? who have we here? is't you?  
MALE
Nay, stay, my lord; I come to bring you news;
Mine uncle's taken prisoner by the Scots.
MALE
Then ransom him.
MALE
'Twas in your wars; you should ransom him.
MALE
And you will ransom him, or else--
MALE
What, Mortimer, you will not threaten him?
MALE
Quiet yourself; you shall have the broad seal,
To gather for him th[o]roughout the realm.
MALE
Your minion Gaveston hath taught you this.
MALE
My lord, the family of the Mortimers
Are not so poor, but, would they sell their land,
'Twould levy men enough to anger you.
We never beg, but use such prayers as these.
MALE
Shall I still be haunted thus?
MALE
Nay, now you are here alone, I'll speak my mind.
MALE
And so will I; and then, my lord, farewell.
MALE
The idle triumphs, masks, lascivious shows,
And prodigal gifts bestow'd on Gaveston,
Have drawn thy treasury dry, and made thee weak;
The murmuring commons, overstretched, break.
MALE
Look for rebellion, look to be depos'd:
Thy garrisons are beaten out of France,
And, lame and poor, lie groaning at the gates;
The wild Oneil, with swarms of Irish kerns,
Lives uncontroll'd within the English pale;
Unto the walls of York the Scots make road,
And, unresisted, drive away rich spoils.
MALE
The haughty Dane commands the narrow seas,
While in the harbour ride thy ships unrigg'd.
MALE
What foreign prince sends thee ambassadors?
MALE
Who loves thee, but a sort of flatterers?
MALE
Thy gentle queen, sole sister to Valois,
Complains that thou hast left her all forlorn.
MALE
Thy court is naked, being bereft of those
That make a king seem glorious to the world,
I mean the peers, whom thou shouldst dearly love;
Libels are cast against thee in the street;
Ballads and rhymes made of thy overthrow.
MALE
The northern borderers, seeing their houses burnt,
Their wives and children slain, run up and down,
Cursing the name of thee and Gaveston.
MALE
When wert thou in the field with banner spread,
But once? and then thy soldiers march'd like players,
With garish robes, not armour; and thyself,
Bedaub'd with gold, rode laughing at the rest,
Nodding and shaking of thy spangled crest,
Where women's favours hung like labels down.
MALE
And thereof came it that the fleering Scots,
To England's high disgrace, have made this jig;
Maids of England, sore may you mourn,
For your lemans you have lost at Bannocksbourn,--
With a heave and a ho!
What weeneth the king of England
So soon to have won Scotland!--
With a rombelow!
MALE
Wigmore shall fly, to set my uncle free.
MALE
And, when 'tis gone, our swords shall purchase more.
If you be mov'd, revenge it as you can:
Look next to see us with our ensigns spread.  
MALE
My swelling heart for very anger breaks:
How oft have I been baited by these peers,
And dare not be reveng'd, for their power is great!
Yet, shall the crowning of these cockerels
Affright a lion?  Edward, unfold thy paws,
And let their lives'-blood slake thy fury's hunger.
If I be cruel and grow tyrannous,
Now let them thank themselves, and rue too late.
MALE
My lord, I see your love to Gaveston
Will be the ruin of the realm and you,
For now the wrathful nobles threaten wars;
And therefore, brother, banish him for ever.
MALE
Art thou an enemy to my Gaveston?
MALE
Ay; and it grieves me that I favour'd him.
MALE
Traitor, be gone! whine thou with Mortimer.
MALE
So will I, rather than with Gaveston.
MALE
Out of my sight, and trouble me no more!
MALE
No marvel though thou scorn thy noble peers,
When I thy brother am rejected thus.
MALE
Away!
Poor Gaveston, thou hast no friend but me!
Do what they can, we'll live in Tynmouth here;
And, so I walk with him about the walls,
What care I though the earls begirt us round?
Here comes she that is cause of all these jars.


FEMALE
My lord, 'tis thought the earls are up in arms.
MALE
Ay, and 'tis likewise thought you favour 'em.
FEMALE
Thus do you still suspect me without cause.
FEMALE
Sweet uncle, speak more kindly to the queen.
MALE
 My lord, dissemble with her; speak her fair.
MALE
Pardon me, sweet; I forgot myself.
FEMALE
Your pardon is quickly got of Isabel.
MALE
The younger Mortimer is grown so brave,
That to my face he threatens civil wars.
MALE
 Why do you not commit him to the Tower?
MALE
I dare not, for the people love him well.
MALE
 Why, then, we'll have him privily made away.
MALE
Would Lancaster and he had both carous'd
A bowl of poison to each other's health!
But let them go, and tell me what are these.
FEMALE
Two of my father's servants whilst he liv'd:
May't please your grace to entertain them now.
MALE
Tell me, where wast thou born? what is thine arms?
MALE
My name is Baldock, and my gentry
I fetch from Oxford, not from heraldry.
MALE
The fitter art thou, Baldock, for my turn.
Wait on me, and I'll see thou shalt not want.
MALE
I humbly thank your majesty.
MALE
Knowest thou him, Gaveston.
MALE
 Ay, my lord;
His name is Spenser; he is well allied:
For my sake let him wait upon your grace;
Scarce shall you find a man of more desert.
MALE
Then, Spenser, wait upon me for his sake:
I'll grace thee with a higher style ere long.
MALE
No greater titles happen unto me
Than to be favour'd of your majesty!
MALE
Cousin, this day shall be your marriage feast:--
And, Gaveston, think that I love thee well,
To wed thee to our niece, the only heir
Unto the Earl of Glocester late deceas'd.
MALE
 I know, my lord, many will stomach me;
But I respect neither their love nor hate.
MALE
The headstrong barons shall not limit me;
He that I list to favour shall be great.
Come, let's away; and, when the marriage ends,
Have at the rebels and their complices!

MALE
My lords, of love to this our native land,
I come to join with you, and leave the king;
And in your quarrel, and the realm's behoof,
Will be the first that shall adventure life.
MALE
I fear me, you are sent of policy,
To undermine us with a show of love.
MALE
He is your brother; therefore have we cause
To cast the worst, and doubt of your revolt.
MALE
Mine honour shall be hostage of my truth:
If that will not suffice, farewell, my lords.
MALE
Stay, Edmund: never was Plantagenet
False of his word; and therefore trust we thee.
MALE
But what's the reason you should leave him now?
MALE
I have inform'd the Earl of Lancaster.
MALE
And it sufficeth.  Now, my lords, know this,
That Gaveston is secretly arriv'd,
And here in Tynmouth frolics with the king.
Let us with these our followers scale the walls,
And suddenly surprise them unawares.
MALE
I'll give the onset.
MALE
And I'll follow thee.
MALE
This tatter'd ensign of my ancestors,
Which swept the desert shore of that Dead Sea
Whereof we got the name of Mortimer,
Will I advance upon this castle ['s] walls--
Drums, strike alarum, raise them from their sport,
And ring aloud the knell of Gaveston!
MALE
None be so hardy as to touch the king;
But neither spare you Gaveston nor his friends. 


MALE
O, tell me, Spenser, where is Gaveston?
MALE
I fear me he is slain, my gracious lord.
MALE
No, here he comes; now let them spoil and kill.

Fly, fly, my lords; the earls have got the hold;
Take shipping, and away to Scarborough:
Spenser and I will post away by land.
MALE
 O, stay, my lord! they will not injure you.
MALE
I will not trust them.  Gaveston, away!
MALE
 Farewell, my lord.
MALE
Lady, farewell.
FEMALE
Farewell, sweet uncle, till we meet again.
MALE
Farewell, sweet Gaveston; and farewell, niece.
FEMALE
No farewell to poor Isabel thy queen?
MALE
Yes, yes, for Mortimer your lover's sake.
FEMALE
Heavens can witness, I love none but you.
 
From my embracements thus he breaks away.
O, that mine arms could close this isle about,
That I might pull him to me where I would!
Or that these tears, that drizzle from mine eyes,
Had power to mollify his stony heart,
That, when I had him, we might never part!

MALE
I wonder how he scap'd.
MALE
Who's this? the queen!
FEMALE
Ay, Mortimer, the miserable queen,
Whose pining heart her inward sighs have blasted,
And body with continual mourning wasted:
These hands are tir'd with haling of my lord
From Gaveston, from wicked Gaveston;
And all in vain; for, when I speak him fair,
He turns away, and smiles upon his minion.
MALE
Cease to lament, and tell us where's the king?
FEMALE
What would you with the king? is't him you seek?
MALE
No, madam, but that cursed Gaveston:
Far be it from the thought of Lancaster
To offer violence to his sovereign!
We would but rid the realm of Gaveston:
Tell us where he remains, and he shall die.
FEMALE
He's gone by water unto Scarborough:
Pursue him quickly, and he cannot scape;
The king hath left him, and his train is small.
MALE
Forslow no time, sweet Lancaster; let's march.
MALE
How comes it that the king and he is parted?
FEMALE
That thus your army, going several ways,
Might be of lesser force, and with the power
That he intendeth presently to raise,
Be easily suppress'd: therefore be gone.
MALE
Here in the river rides a Flemish hoy:
Let's all aboard, and follow him amain.
MALE
The wind that bears him hence will fill our sails;
Come, come, aboard! 'tis but an hour's sailing.
MALE
Madam, stay you within this castle here.
FEMALE
No, Mortimer; I'll to my lord the king.
MALE
Nay, rather sail with us to Scarborough.
FEMALE
You know the king is so suspicious
As, if he hear I have but talk'd with you,
Mine honour will be call'd in question;
And therefore, gentle Mortimer, be gone.
MALE
Madam, I cannot stay to answer you:
But think of Mortimer as he deserves.
 
FEMALE
So well hast thou deserv'd, sweet Mortimer,
As Isabel could live with thee for ever.
In vain I look for love at Edward's hand,
Whose eyes are fix'd on none but Gaveston.
Yet once more I'll importune him with prayer:
If he be strange, and not regard my words,
My son and I will over into France,
And to the king my brother there complain
How Gaveston hath robb'd me of his love:
But yet, I hope, my sorrows will have end,
And Gaveston this blessed day be slain.  

MALE
 Yet, lusty lords, I have escap'd your hands,
Your threats, your 'larums, and your hot pursuits;
And, though divorced from King Edward's eyes,
Yet liveth Pierce of Gaveston unsurpris'd,
Breathing in hope (malgrado all your beards,
That muster rebels thus against your king)
To see his royal sovereign once again.


MALE
Upon him, soldiers! take away his weapons!
MALE
Thou proud disturber of thy country's peace,
Corrupter of thy king, cause of these broils,
Base flatterer, yield! and, were it not for shame,
Shame and dishonour to a soldier's name,
Upon my weapon's point here shouldst thou fall,
And welter in thy gore.
MALE
Monster of men,
That, like the Greekish strumpet, train'd to arms
And bloody wars so many valiant knights,
Look for no other fortune, wretch, than death!
King Edward is not here to buckler thee.
MALE
Lancaster, why talk'st thou to the slave?--
Go, soldiers, take him hence; for, by my sword,
His head shall off.--Gaveston, short warning
Shall serve thy turn: it is our country's cause
That here severely we will execute
Upon thy person.--Hang him at a bough.
MALE
 My lord,--
MALE
Soldiers, have him away.--
But, for thou wert the favourite of a king,
Thou shalt have so much honour at our hands.
MALE
 I thank you all, my lords: then I perceive
That heading is one, and hanging is the other,
And death is all.

MALE
How now, my Lord of Arundel!
MALE
My lords, King Edward greets you all by me.
MALE
Arundel, say your message.
MALE
His majesty, hearing that you had taken Gaveston,
Entreateth you by me, yet but he may
See him before he dies; for why, he says,
And sends you word, he knows that die he shall;
And, if you gratify his grace so far,
He will be mindful of the courtesy.
MALE
How now!
MALE
 Renowmed Edward, how thy name
Revives poor Gaveston!
MALE
No, it needeth not:
Arundel, we will gratify the king
In other matters; he must pardon us in this.--
Soldiers, away with him!
MALE
 Why, my Lord of Warwick,
Will now these short delays beget my hopes?
I know it, lords, it is life you aim at,
Yet grant King Edward this.
MALE
Shalt thou appoint
What we shall grant?--Soldiers, away with him!--
Thus we'll gratify the king;
We'll send his head by thee; let him bestow
His tears on that, for that is all he gets
Of Gaveston, or else his senseless trunk.
MALE
Not so, my lord, lest he bestow more cost
In burying him than he hath ever earn'd.
MALE
My lords, it is his majesty's request,
And in the honour of a king he swears,
He will but talk with him, and send him back.
MALE
When, can you tell?  Arundel, no; we wot
He that the care of his realm remits,
And drives his nobles to these exigents
For Gaveston, will, if he seize him once,
Violate any promise to possess him.
MALE
Then, if you will not trust his grace in keep,
My lords, I will be pledge for his return.
MALE
'Tis honourable in thee to offer this;
But, for we know thou art a noble gentleman,
We will not wrong thee so,
To make away a true man for a thief.
MALE
 How mean'st thou, Mortimer? that is over-base.
MALE
Away, base groom, robber of king's renown!
Question with thy companions and mates.
MALE
My Lord Mortimer, and you, my lords, each one,
To gratify the king's request therein,
Touching the sending of this Gaveston,
Because his majesty so earnestly
Desires to see the man before his death,
I will upon mine honour undertake
To carry him, and bring him back again;
Provided this, that you, my Lord of Arundel,
Will join with me.
MALE
Pembroke, what wilt thou do?
Cause yet more bloodshed? is it not enough
That we have taken him, but must we now
Leave him on "Had I wist," and let him go?
MALE
My lords, I will not over-woo your honours:
But, if you dare trust Pembroke with the prisoner,
Upon mine oath, I will return him back.
MALE
My Lord of Lancaster, what say you in this?
MALE
Why, I say, let him go on Pembroke's word.
MALE
And you, Lord Mortimer?
MALE
How say you, my Lord of Warwick?
MALE
Nay, do your pleasures: I know how 'twill prove.
MALE
Then give him me.
MALE
 Sweet sovereign, yet I come
To see thee ere I die!
MALE
Yet not perhaps,
If Warwick's wit and policy prevail. 
MALE
My Lord of Pembroke, we deliver him you:
Return him on your honour.--Sound, away!
 
  and other attendants of Pembroke.
MALE
My lord, you shall go with me:
My house is not far hence; out of the way
A little; but our men shall go along.
We that have pretty wenches to our wives,
Sir, must not come so near to balk their lips.
MALE
'Tis very kindly spoke, my Lord of Pembroke:
Your honour hath an adamant of power
To draw a prince.
MALE
So, my lord.--Come hither, James:
I do commit this Gaveston to thee;
Be thou this night his keeper; in the morning
We will discharge thee of thy charge: be gone.
MALE
 Unhappy Gaveston, whither go'st thou now?

MALE
My lord, we'll quickly be at Cobham.  

MALE
 O treacherous Warwick, thus to wrong thy friend!
MALE
I see it is your life these arms pursue.
MALE
 Weaponless must I fall, and die in bands?
O, must this day be period of my life,
Centre of all my bliss?  And ye be men,
Speed to the king.

MALE
My Lord of Pembroke's men,
Strive you no longer: I will have that Gaveston.
MALE
Your lordship doth dishonour to yourself,
And wrong our lord, your honourable friend.
MALE
No, James, it is my country's cause I follow.--
Go, take the villain: soldiers, come away;
We'll make quick work.--Commend me to your master,
My friend, and tell him that I watch'd it well.--
Come, let thy shadow parley with King Edward.
MALE
 Treacherous earl, shall I not see the king?
MALE
The king of heaven perhaps, no other king.--
Away!  
MALE
Come, fellows: it booted not for us to strive:
We will in haste go certify our lord.  

MALE
I long to hear an answer from the barons
Touching my friend, my dearest Gaveston.
Ah, Spenser, not the riches of my realm
Can ransom him! ah, he is mark'd to die!
I know the malice of the younger Mortimer;
Warwick I know is rough, and Lancaster
Inexorable; and I shall never see
My lovely Pierce of Gaveston again:
The barons overbear with me their pride.
MALE
Were I King Edward, England's sovereign,
Son to the lovely Eleanor of Spain,
Great Edward Longshanks' issue, would I bear
These braves, this rage, and suffer uncontroll'd
These barons thus to beard me in my land,
In mine own realm?  My lord, pardon my speech:
Did you retain your father's magnanimity,
Did you regard the honour of your name,
You would not suffer thus your majesty
Be counterbuff'd of your nobility.
Strike off their heads, and let them preach on poles:
No doubt, such lessons they will teach the rest,
As by their preachments they will profit much,
And learn obedience to their lawful king.
MALE
Yes, gentle Spenser, we have been too mild,
Too kind to them; but now have drawn our sword,
And, if they send me not my Gaveston,
We'll steel it on their crest[s], and poll their tops.
MALE
This haught resolve becomes your majesty,
Not to be tied to their affection,
As though your highness were a school-boy still,
And must be aw'd and govern'd like a child.

MALE
Long live my sovereign, the noble Edward,
In peace triumphant, fortunate in wars!
MALE
Welcome, old man: com'st thou in Edward's aid?
Then tell thy prince of whence and what thou art.
MALE
Low, with a band of bow-men and of pikes,
Brown bills and targeteers, four hundred strong,
Sworn to defend King Edward's royal right,
I come in person to your majesty,
Spenser, the father of Hugh Spenser there,
Bound to your highness everlastingly
For favour done, in him, unto us all.
MALE
Thy father, Spenser?
MALE
True, an it like your grace,
That pours, in lieu of all your goodness shown,
His life, my lord, before your princely feet.
MALE
Welcome ten thousand times, old man, again!
Spenser, this love, this kindness to thy king,
Argues thy noble mind and disposition.
Spenser, I here create thee Earl of Wiltshire,
And daily will enrich thee with our favour,
That, as the sunshine, shall reflect o'er thee.
Beside, the more to manifest our love,
Because we hear Lord Bruce doth sell his land,
And that the Mortimers are in hand withal,
Thou shalt have crowns of us t'outbid the barons;
And, Spenser, spare them not, lay it on.--
Soldiers, a largess, and thrice-welcome all!
MALE
My lord, here comes the queen.

MALE
Madam, what news?
FEMALE
News of dishonour, lord, and discontent.
Our friend Levune, faithful and full of trust,
Informeth us, by letters and by words,
That Lord Valois our brother, King of France,
Because your highness hath been slack in homage,
Hath seized Normandy into his hands:
These be the letters, this the messenger.
MALE
Welcome, Levune.--Tush, Sib, if this be all,
Valois and I will soon be friends again.--
But to my Gaveston: shall I never see,
Never behold thee now!--Madam, in this matter
We will employ you and your little son;
You shall go parley with the King of France.--
Boy, see you bear you bravely to the king,
And do your message with a majesty.
MALE
Commit not to my youth things of more weight
Than fits a prince so young as I to bear;
And fear not, lord and father,--heaven's great beams
On Atlas' shoulder shall not lie more safe
Than shall your charge committed to my trust.
FEMALE
Ah, boy, this towardness makes thy mother fear
Thou art not mark'd to many days on earth!
MALE
Madam, we will that you with speed be shipp'd,
And this our son; Levune shall follow you
With all the haste we can despatch him hence.
Choose of our lords to bear you company;
And go in peace; leave us in wars at home.
FEMALE
Unnatural wars, where subjects brave their king:
God end them once!--My lord, I take my leave,
To make my preparation for France.

MALE
What, Lord Arundel, dost thou come alone?
MALE
Yea, my good lord, for Gaveston is dead.
MALE
Ah, traitors, have they put my friend to death?
Tell me, Arundel, died he ere thou cam'st,
Or didst thou see my friend to take his death?
MALE
Neither, my lord; for, as he was surpris'd,
Begirt with weapons and with enemies round,
I did your highness' message to them all,
Demanding him of them, entreating rather,
And said, upon the honour of my name,
That I would undertake to carry him
Unto your highness, and to bring him back.
MALE
And, tell me, would the rebels deny me that?
MALE
Proud recreants!
MALE
Yea, Spenser, traitors all!
MALE
In found them at the first inexorable;
The Earl of Warwick would not bide the hearing,
Mortimer hardly; Pembroke and Lancaster
Spake least; and when they flatly had denied,
Refusing to receive me pledge for him,
The Earl of Pembroke mildly thus bespake;
"My lord, because our sovereign sends for him,
And promiseth he shall be safe return'd,
I will this undertake, to have him hence,
And see him re-deliver'd to your hands."
MALE
Well, and how fortunes [it] that he came not?
MALE
Some treason or some villany was cause.
MALE
The Earl of Warwick seiz'd him on his way;
For, being deliver'd unto Pembroke's men,
Their lord rode home, thinking his prisoner safe;
But, ere he came, Warwick in ambush lay,
And bare him to his death; and in a trench
Strake off his head, and march'd unto the camp.
MALE
A bloody part, flatly 'gainst law of arms!
MALE
O, shall I speak, or shall I sigh and die!
MALE
My lord, refer your vengeance to the sword
Upon these barons; hearten up your men;
Let them not unreveng'd murder your friends:
Advance your standard, Edward, in the field,
And march to fire them from their starting-holes.
MALE
By earth, the common mother of us all,
By heaven, and all the moving orbs thereof,
By this right hand, and by my father's sword,
And all the honours 'longing to my crown,
I will have heads and lives for him as many
As I have manors, castles, towns, and towers!--  
Treacherous Warwick! traitorous Mortimer!
If I be England's king, in lakes of gore
Your headless trunks, your bodies will I trail,
That you may drink your fill, and quaff in blood,
And stain my royal standard with the same,
That so my bloody colours may suggest
Remembrance of revenge immortally
On your accursed traitorous progeny,
You villains that have slain my Gaveston!--
And in this place of honour and of trust,
Spenser, sweet Spenser, I adopt thee here;
And merely of our love we do create thee
Earl of Glocester and Lord Chamberlain,
Despite of times, despite of enemies.
MALE
My lord, here's a messenger from the barons
Desires access unto your majesty.
MALE
Admit him near.

MALE
Long live King Edward, England's lawful lord!
MALE
So wish not they, I wis, that sent thee hither:
Thou com'st from Mortimer and his complices:
A ranker rout of rebels never was.
Well, say thy message.
MALE
The barons, up in arms, by me salute
Your highness with long life and happiness;
And bid me say, as plainer to your grace,
That if without effusion of blood
You will this grief have ease and remedy,
That from your princely person you remove
This Spenser, as a putrifying branch
That deads the royal vine, whose golden leaves
Empale your princely head, your diadem;
Whose brightness such pernicious upstarts dim,
Say they, and lovingly advise your grace
To cherish virtue and nobility,
And have old servitors in high esteem,
And shake off smooth dissembling flatterers:
This granted, they, their honours, and their lives,
Are to your highness vow'd and consecrate.
MALE
Ah, traitors, will they still display their pride?
MALE
Away! tarry no answer, but be gone!--
Rebels, will they appoint their sovereign
His sports, his pleasures, and his company?--
Yet, ere thou go, see how I do divorce
Spenser from thee.  Now get thee to thy lords,
And tell them I will come to chastise them
For murdering Gaveston: hie thee, get thee gone!
Edward, with fire and sword, follows at thy heels.  
My lord[s], perceive you how these rebels swell?--
Soldiers, good hearts! defend your sovereign's right,
For, now, even now, we march to make them stoop.
Away!

MALE
Why do we sound retreat? upon them, lords!
This day I shall your vengeance with my sword
On those proud rebels that are up in arms,
And do confront and countermand their king.
MALE
I doubt it not, my lord; right will prevail.
MALE
'Tis not amiss, my liege, for either part
To breathe a while; our men, with sweat and dust
All chok'd well near, begin to faint for heat;
And this retire refresheth horse and man.
MALE
Here come the rebels.

MALE
Look, Lancaster, yonder is Edward
Among his flatterers.
MALE
And there let him be,
Till he pay dearly for their company.
MALE
And shall, or Warwick's sword shall smite in vain.
MALE
What, rebels, do you shrink and sound retreat?
MALE
No, Edward, no; thy flatterers faint and fly.
MALE
They'd best betimes forsake thee and their trains,
For they'll betray thee, traitors as they are.
MALE
Traitor on thy face, rebellious Lancaster!
MALE
Away, base upstart! brav'st thou nobles thus?
MALE
A noble attempt and honourable deed,
Is it not, trow ye, to assemble aid
And levy arms against your lawful king?
MALE
For which, ere long, their heads shall satisfy
T' appease the wrath of their offended king.
MALE
Then, Edward, thou wilt fight it to the last,
And rather bathe thy sword in subjects' blood
Than banish that pernicious company?
MALE
Ay, traitors all, rather than thus be brav'd,
Make England's civil towns huge heaps of stones,
And ploughs to go about our palace-gates.
MALE
A desperate and unnatural resolution!--
Alarum to the fight!
Saint George for England, and the barons' right!
MALE
Saint George for England, and King Edward's right!



MALE
Now, lusty lords, now not by chance of war,
But justice of the quarrel and the cause,
Vail'd is your pride: methinks you hang the heads
But we'll advance them, traitors: now 'tis time
To be aveng'd on you for all your braves,
And for the murder of my dearest friend,
To whom right well you knew our soul was knit,
Good Pierce of Gaveston, my sweet favourite:
Ah, rebels, recreants, you made him away!
MALE
Brother, in regard of thee and of thy land,
Did they remove that flatterer from thy throne.
MALE
So, sir, you have spoke: away, avoid our presence!

Accursed wretches, was't in regard of us,
When we had sent our messenger to request
He might be spar'd to come to speak with us,
And Pembroke undertook for his return,
That thou, proud Warwick, watch'd the prisoner,
Poor Pierce, and headed him 'gainst law of arms?
For which thy head shall overlook the rest
As much as thou in rage outwent'st the rest.
MALE
Tyrant, I scorn thy threats and menaces;
It is but temporal that thou canst inflict.
MALE
The worst is death; and better die to live
Than live in infamy under such a king.
MALE
Away with them, my lord of Winchester!
These lusty leaders, Warwick and Lancaster,
I charge you roundly, off with both their heads!
Away!
MALE
Farewell, vain world!
MALE
Sweet Mortimer, farewell!
MALE
England, unkind to thy nobility,
Groan for this grief! behold how thou art maim'd!
MALE
Go, take that haughty Mortimer to the Tower;
There see him safe bestow'd; and, for the rest,
Do speedy execution on them all.
Be gone!
MALE
What, Mortimer, can ragged stony walls
Immure thy virtue that aspires to heaven?
No, Edward, England's scourge, it may not be;
Mortimer's hope surmounts his fortune far.

MALE
Sound, drums and trumpets!  March with me, my friends.
Edward this day hath crown'd him king anew.

 Levune and Baldock.
MALE
Levune, the trust that we repose in thee
Begets the quiet of King Edward's land:
Therefore be gone in haste, and with advice
Bestow that treasure on the lords of France,
That, therewith all enchanted, like the guard
That suffer'd Jove to pass in showers of gold
To Danaë, all aid may be denied
To Isabel the queen, that now in France
Makes friends, to cross the seas with her young son,
And step into his father's regiment.
MALE
That's it these barons and the subtle queen
Long levell'd at.
MALE
 Yea, but, Levune, thou seest,
These barons lay their heads on blocks together:
What they intend, the hangman frustrates clean.
MALE
Have you no doubt, my lords, I'll clap so close
Among the lords of France with England's gold,
That Isabel shall make her plaints in vain,
And France shall be obdurate with her tears.
MALE
Then make for France amain; Levune, away!
Proclaim King Edward's wars and victories.

MALE
Fair blows the wind for France: blow, gentle gale,
Till Edmund be arriv'd for England's good!
Nature, yield to my country's cause in this!
A brother? no, a butcher of thy friends!
Proud Edward, dost thou banish me thy presence?
But I'll to France, and cheer the wronged queen,
And certify what Edward's looseness is.
Unnatural king, to slaughter nobleman
And cherish flatterers!  Mortimer, I stay
Thy sweet escape.  Stand gracious, gloomy night,
To his device!


MALE
Holla! who walketh there?
Is't you, my lord?
MALE
Mortimer, 'tis I.
But hath thy portion wrought so happily?
MALE
It hath, my lord: the warders all asleep,
I thank them, gave me leave to pass in peace.
But hath your grace got shipping unto France?
MALE
Fear it not. 


FEMALE
Ah, boy, our friends do fail us all in France!
The lords are cruel, and the king unkind.
What shall we do?
MALE
Madam, return to England,
And please my father well; and then a fig
For all my uncle's friendship here in France!
I warrant you, I'll win his highness quickly;
'A loves me better than a thousand Spensers.
FEMALE
Ah, boy, thou art deceiv'd, at least in this,
To think that we can yet be tun'd together!
No, no, we jar too far.--Unkind Valois!
Unhappy Isabel, when France rejects,
Whither, O, whither dost thou bend thy steps?

MALE
Madam, what cheer?
FEMALE
Ah, good Sir John of Hainault,
Never so cheerless nor so far distrest!
MALE
I hear, sweet lady, of the king's unkindness:
But droop not, madam; noble minds contemn
Despair.  Will your grace with me to Hainault,
And there stay time's advantage with your son?--
How say you, my lord! will you go with your friends,
And shake off all our fortunes equally?
MALE
So pleaseth the queen my mother, me it likes:
The king of England, not the court of France,
Shall have me from my gracious mother's side,
Till I be strong enough to break a staff;
And then have at the proudest Spenser's head!
MALE
Well said, my lord!
FEMALE
O my sweet heart, how do I moan thy wrongs,
Yet triumph in the hope of thee, my joy!--
Ah, sweet Sir John, even to the utmost verge
Of Europe, on the shore of Tanais,
Will we with thee to Hainault--so we will:
The marquis is a noble gentleman;
His grace, I dare presume, will welcome me.--
But who are these?

MALE
Madam, long may you live,
Much happier than your friends in England do!
FEMALE
Lord Edmund and Lord Mortimer alive!
Welcome to France! the news was here, my lord,
That you were dead, or very near your death.
MALE
Lady, the last was truest of the twain:
But Mortimer, reserv'd for better hap,
Hath shaken off the thraldom of the Tower,
And lives t' advance your standard, good my lord.
MALE
How mean you, and the king my father lives?
No, my Lord Mortimer, not I, I trow.
FEMALE
Not, son! Why not?  I would it were no worse!--
But, gentle lords, friendless we are in France.
MALE
Monsieur Le Grand, a noble friend of yours,
Told us, at our arrival, all the news,--
How hard the nobles, how unkind the king
Hath show'd himself: but, madam, right makes room
Where weapons want; and, though a many friends
Are made away, as Warwick, Lancaster,
And others of our part and faction,
Yet have we friends, assure your grace, in England,
Would cast up caps, and clap their hands for joy,
To see us there, appointed for our foes.
MALE
Would all were well, and Edward well reclaim'd,
For England's honour, peace, and quietness!
MALE
But by the sword, my lord, 't must be deserv'd:
The king will ne'er forsake his flatterers.
MALE
My lords of England, sith th' ungentle king
Of France refuseth to give aid of arms
To this distressed queen, his sister, here,
Go you with her to Hainault: doubt ye not
We will find comfort, money, men, and friends,
Ere long to bid the English king a base.--
How say'st, young prince, what think you of the match?
MALE
I think King Edward will outrun us all.
FEMALE
Nay, son, not so; and you must not discourage
Your friends that are so forward in your aid.
MALE
Sir John of Hainault, pardon us, I pray:
These comforts that you give our woful queen
Bind us in kindness all at your command.
FEMALE
Yea, gentle brother:--and the God of heaven
Prosper your happy motion, good Sir John!
MALE
This noble gentleman, forward in arms,
Was born, I see, to be our anchor-hold.--
Sir John of Hainault, be it thy renown,
That England's queen and nobles in distress
Have been by thee restor'd and comforted.
MALE
Madam, along; and you, my lord[s], with me,
That England's peers may Hainault's welcome see.


MALE
Thus, after many threats of wrathful war,
Triumpheth England's Edward with his friends,
And triumph Edward with his friends uncontroll'd!--
My Lord of Glocester, do you hear the news?
MALE
What news, my lord?
MALE
Why, man, they say there is great execution
Done through the realm.--My Lord of Arundel,
You have the note, have you not?
MALE
From the Lieutenant of the Tower, my lord.
MALE
I pray, let us see it. 
--What have we there?--
Read it, Spenser.
  
Why, so: they bark'd apace a month ago;
Now, on my life, they'll neither bark nor bite.
Now, sirs, the news from France?  Glocester, I trow,
The lords of France love England's gold so well
As Isabella gets no aid from thence.
What now remains? have you proclaim'd, my lord,
Reward for them can bring in Mortimer?
MALE
My lord, we have; and, if he be in England,
'A will be had ere long, I doubt it not.
MALE
If, dost thou say?  Spenser, as true as death,
He is in England's ground: our port-masters
Are not so careless of their king's command.

How now! what news with thee? from whence come these?
MALE
Letters, my lord, and tidings forth of France:
To you, my Lord of Glocester, from Levune.

MALE
Read.
MALE
My duty to your honour promised, etc., I
have, according to instructions in that behalf, dealt with the
King of France and his lords, and effected that the queen, all
discontented and discomforted, is gone: whither, if you ask,
with Sir John of Hainault, brother to the marquis, into
Flanders.  With them are gone Lord Edmund and the Lord
Mortimer, having in their company divers of your nation,
and others; and, as constant report goeth, they intend to
give King Edward battle in England, sooner than he can
look for them.  This is all the news of import.
Your honour's in all service, Levune.
MALE
Ah, villains, hath that Mortimer escap'd?
With him is Edmund gone associate?
And will Sir John of Hainault lead the round?
Welcome, o' God's name, madam, and your son!
England shall welcome you and all your rout.
Gallop apace, bright Phbus, through the sky;
And, dusky Night, in rusty iron car,
Between you both shorten the time, I pray,
That I may see that most desired day,
When we may meet these traitors in the field!
Ah, nothing grieves me, but my little boy
Is thus misled to countenance their ills!
Come, friends, to Bristow, there to make us strong:
And, winds, as equal be to bring them in,
As you injurious were to bear them forth! 

FEMALE
Now, lords, our loving friends and countrymen,
Welcome to England all, with prosperous winds!
Our kindest friends in Belgia have we left,
To cope with friends at home; a heavy case
When force to force is knit, and sword and glaive
In civil broils make kin and countrymen
Slaughter themselves in others, and their sides
With their own weapons gor'd!  But what's the help?
Misgovern'd kings are cause of all this wreck;
And, Edward, thou art one among them all,
Whose looseness hath betray'd thy land to spoil,
Who made the channel overflow with blood
Of thine own people: patron shouldst thou be;
But thou--
MALE
Nay, madam, if you be a warrior,
You must not grow so passionate in speeches.--
Lords, sith that we are, by sufferance of heaven,
Arriv'd and armed in this prince's right,
Here for our country's cause swear we to him
All homage, fealty, and forwardness;
And for the open wrongs and injuries
Edward hath done to us, his queen, and land,
We come in arms to wreck it with the sword;
That England's queen in peace may repossess
Her dignities and honours; and withal
We may remove these flatterers from the king
That havock England's wealth and treasury.
MALE
Sound trumpets, my lord, and forward let us march.
Edward will think we come to flatter him.
MALE
I would he never had been flatter'd more!  

MALE
Fly, fly, my lord! the queen is overstrong;
Her friends do multiply, and yours do fail.
Shape we our course to Ireland, there to breathe.
MALE
What, was I born to fly and run away,
And leave the Mortimers conquerors behind?
Give me my horse, and let's reinforce our troops.
And in this bed of honour die with fame.
MALE
O, no, my lord! this princely resolution
Fits not the time: away! we are pursu'd.  

MALE
This way he fled; but I am come too late.
Edward, alas, my heart relents for thee!
Proud traitor, Mortimer, why dost thou chase
Thy lawful king, thy sovereign, with thy sword?
Vile wretch, and why hast thou, of all unkind,
Borne arms against thy brother and thy king?
Rain showers of vengeance on my cursed head,
Thou God, to whom in justice it belongs
To punish this unnatural revolt!
Edward, this Mortimer aims at thy life:
O, fly him, then!  But, Edmund, calm this rage;
Dissemble, or thou diest; for Mortimer
And Isabel do kiss, while they conspire:
And yet she bears a face of love, forsooth:
Fie on that love that hatcheth death and hate!
Edmund, away! Bristow to Longshanks' blood
Is false; be not found single for suspect:
Proud Mortimer pries near into thy walks.

FEMALE
Successful battle gives the God of kings
To them that fight in right, and fear in wrath,
Since, then, successfully we have prevail'd,
Thanked be heaven's great architect, and you!
Ere farther we proceed, my noble lords,
We here create our well-beloved son,
Of love and care unto his royal person,
Lord Warden of the realm; and, sith the Fates
Have made his father so infortunate,
Deal you, my lords, in this, my loving lords,
As to your wisdoms fittest seems in all.
MALE
Madam, without offence if I may ask
How will you deal with Edward in his fall?
MALE
Tell me, good uncle, what Edward do you mean?
MALE
Nephew, your father; I dare not call him king.
MALE
My Lord of Kent, what needs these questions?
'Tis not in her controlment nor in ours;
But as the realm and parliament shall please,
So shall your brother be disposed of.--
I like not this relenting mood in Edmund:
Madam, 'tis good to look to him betimes.  
FEMALE
My lord, the Mayor of Bristow knows our mind.
MALE
Yea, madam; and they scape not easily
That fled the field.
FEMALE
Baldock is with the king:
A goodly chancellor, is he not, my lord?
MALE
So are the Spensers, the father and the son.
MALE
This Edward is the ruin of the realm.

MALE
God save Queen Isabel and her princely son!
Madam, the Mayor and citizens of Bristow,
In sign of love and duty to this presence,
Present by me this traitor to the state,
Spenser, the father to that wanton Spenser,
That, like the lawless Catiline of Rome,
Revell'd in England's wealth and treasury.
FEMALE
We thank you all.
MALE
Your loving care in this
Deserveth princely favours and rewards.
But where's the king and the other Spenser fled?
MALE
Spenser the son, created Earl of Glocester,
Is with that smooth-tongu'd scholar Baldock gone,
And shipp'd but late for Ireland with the king.
MALE
Some whirlwind fetch them back, or sink them all!--
They shall be started thence, I doubt it not.
MALE
Shall I not see the king my father yet?
MALE
Unhappy Edward, chas'd from England's bounds!  
MALE
Madam, what resteth? why stand you in a muse?
FEMALE
I rue my lord's ill-fortune: but, alas,
Care of my country call'd me to this war!
MALE
Madam, have done with care and sad complaint:
Your king hath wrong'd your country and himself,
And we must seek to right it as we may.--
Meanwhile have hence this rebel to the block.
MALE
Rebel is he that fights against the prince:
So fought not they that fought in Edward's right.
MALE
Take him away; he prates.
  
 You, Rice ap Howel,
Shall do good service to her majesty,
Being of countenance in your country here,
To follow these rebellious runagates.--
We in mean while, madam, must take advice.
How Baldock, Spenser, and their complices,
May in their fall be follow'd to their end.  

MALE
Have you no doubt, my lord; have you no fear:
As silent and as careful we will be
To keep your royal person safe with us,
Free from suspect, and fell invasion
Of such as have your majesty in chase,
Yourself, and those your chosen company,
As danger of this stormy time requires.
MALE
Father, thy face should harbour no deceit.
O, hadst thou ever been a king, thy heart,
Pierc'd deeply with sense of my distress,
Could not but take compassion of my state!
Stately and proud in riches and in train,
Whilom I was, powerful and full of pomp:
But what is he whom rule and empery
Have not in life or death made miserable?--
Come, Spenser,--come, Baldock,--come, sit down by me;
Make trial now of that philosophy
That in our famous nurseries of arts
Thou suck'dst from Plato and from Aristotle.--
Father, this life contemplative is heaven:
O, that I might this life in quiet lead!
But we, alas, are chas'd!--and you, my friends,
Your lives and my dishonour they pursue.--
Yet, gentle monks, for treasure, gold, nor fee,
Do you betray us and our company.
MALE
Your grace may sit secure, if none but we
Do wot of your abode.
MALE
Not one alive: but shrewdly I suspect
A gloomy fellow in a mead below;
'A gave a long look after us, my lord;
And all the land, I know, is up in arms,
Arms that pursue our lives with deadly hate.
MALE
We were embark'd for Ireland; wretched we,
With awkward winds and with sore tempests driven,
To fall on shore, and here to pine in fear
Of Mortimer and his confederates!
MALE
Mortimer! who talks of Mortimer?
Who wounds me with the name of Mortimer,
That bloody man?--Good father, on thy lap
Lay I this head, laden with mickle care.
O, might I never ope these eyes again,
Never again lift up this drooping head,
O, never more lift up this dying heart!
MALE
Look up, my lord.--Baldock, this drowsiness
Betides no good; here even we are betray'd.

MALE
Upon my life, these be the men ye seek.
MALE
Fellow, enough.--My lord, I pray, be short;
A fair commission warrants what we do.
MALE
The queen's commission, urg'd by Mortimer:
What cannot gallant Mortimer with the queen?--
Alas, see where he sits, and hopes unseen
T'escape their hands that seek to reave his life!
Too true it is, Quem dies vidit veniens superbum,
Hunc dies vidit fugiens jacentem.
But, Leicester, leave to grow so passionate.--
Spenser and Baldock, by no other names,
I arrest you of high treason here.
Stand not on titles, but obey th' arrest:
'Tis in the name of Isabel the queen.--
My lord, why droop you thus?
MALE
O day, the last of all my bliss on earth!
Centre of all misfortune!  O my stars,
Why do you lour unkindly on a king?
Comes Leicester, then, in Isabella's name,
To take my life, my company from me?
Here, man, rip up this panting breast of mine,
And take my heart in rescue of my friends.
MALE
Away with them!
MALE
It may become thee yet
To let us take our farewell of his grace.
MALE
My heart with pity earns to see this sight;
A king to bear these words and proud commands!
MALE
Spenser, ah, sweet Spenser, thus, then, must we part?
MALE
We must, my lord; so will the angry heavens.
MALE
Nay, so will hell and cruel Mortimer:
The gentle heavens have not to do in this.
MALE
My lord, it is in vain to grieve or storm.
Here humbly of your grace we take our leaves:
Our lots are cast; I fear me, so is thine.
MALE
In heaven we may, in earth ne'er shall we meet:--
And, Leicester, say, what shall become of us?
MALE
Your majesty must go to Killingworth.
MALE
Must! it is somewhat hard when kings must go.
MALE
Here is a litter ready for your grace,
That waits your pleasure, and the day grows old.
MALE
As good be gone, as stay and be benighted.
MALE
A litter hast thou? lay me in a hearse,
And to the gates of hell convey me hence;
Let Pluto's bells ring out my fatal knell,
And hags howl for my death at Charon's shore;
For friends hath Edward none but these,
And these must die under a tyrant's sword.
MALE
My lord, be going: care not for these;
For we shall see them shorter by the heads.
MALE
Well, that shall be shall be: part we must;
Sweet Spenser, gentle Baldock, part we must.--
Hence, feigned weeds! unfeigned are my woes.--
  
Father, farewell.--Leicester, thou stay'st for me;
And go I must.--Life, farewell, with my friends!
 
MALE
O, is he gone?  is noble Edward gone?
Parted from hence, never to see us more!
Rend, sphere of heaven! and, fire, forsake thy orb!
Earth, melt to air! gone is my sovereign,
Gone, gone, alas, never to make return!
MALE
Spenser, I see our souls are fleeting hence;
We are depriv'd the sunshine of our life.
Make for a new life, man; throw up thy eyes
And heart and hand to heaven's immortal throne;
Pay nature's debt with cheerful countenance;
Reduce we all our lessons unto this,--
To die, sweet Spenser, therefore live we all;
Spenser, all live to die, and rise to fall.
MALE
Come, come, keep these preachments till you come to
the place appointed.  You, and such as you are, have
made wise work in England.  Will your lordships away?
MALE
Your lordship I trust will remember me?
MALE
Remember thee, fellow! what else?  Follow me to
the town.

MALE
Be patient, good my lord, cease to lament;
Imagine Killingworth Castle were your court,
And that you lay for pleasure here a space,
Not of compulsion or necessity.
MALE
Leicester, if gentle words might comfort me,
Thy speeches long ago had eas'd my sorrows,
For kind and loving hast thou always been.
The griefs of private men are soon allay'd;
But not of kings.  The forest deer, being struck,
Runs to an herb that closeth up the wounds:
But when the imperial lion's flesh is gor'd,
He rends and tears it with his wrathful paw,
[And], highly scorning that the lowly earth
Should drink his blood, mounts up to the air:
And so it fares with me, whose dauntless mind
Th' ambitious Mortimer would seek to curb,
And that unnatural queen, false Isabel,
That thus hath pent and mew'd me in a prison
For such outrageous passions cloy my soul,
As with the wings of rancour and disdain
Full oft[ten] am I soaring up to heaven,
To plain me to the gods against them both.
But when I call to mind I am a king,
Methinks I should revenge me of my wrongs,
That Mortimer and Isabel have done.
But what are kings, when regiment is gone,
But perfect shadows in a sunshine day?
My nobles rule; I bear the name of king,
I wear the crown; but am controll'd by them,
By Mortimer, and my unconstant queen,
Who spots my nuptial bed with infamy;
Whilst I am lodg'd within this cave of care,
Where sorrow at my elbow still attends,
To company my heart with sad laments,
That bleeds within me for this strange exchange.
But tell me, must I now resign my crown,
To make usurping Mortimer a king?
MALE
Your grace mistakes; it is for England's good,
And princely Edward's right, we crave the crown.
MALE
No, 'tis for Mortimer, not Edward's head
For he's a lamb, emcompassed by wolves,
Which in a moment will abridge his life.
But, if proud Mortimer do wear this crown,
Heavens turn it to a blaze of quenchless fire!
Or, like the snaky wreath of Tisiphon,
Engirt the temples of his hateful head!
So shall not England's vine be perished,
But Edward's name survive, though Edward dies.
MALE
My lord, why waste you thus the time away?
They stay your answer: will you yield your crown?
MALE
Ah, Leicester, weigh how hardly I can brook
To lose my crown and kingdom without cause;
To give ambitious Mortimer my right,
That, like a mountain, overwhelms my bliss;
In which extreme my mind here murder'd is!
But that the heavens appoint I must obey.--
Here, take my crown; the life of Edward too:  
Two kings in England cannot reign at once.
But stay a while: let me be king till night,
That I may gaze upon this glittering crown;
So shall my eyes receive their last content,
My head, the latest honour due to it,
And jointly both yield up their wished right.
Continue ever, thou celestial sun;
Let never silent night possess this clime;
Stand still, you watches of the element;
All times and seasons, rest you at a stay,
That Edward may be still fair England's king!
But day's bright beams doth vanish fast away,
And needs I must resign my wished crown.
Inhuman creatures, nurs'd with tiger's milk,
Why gape you for your sovereign's overthrow?
My diadem, I mean, and guiltless life.
See, monsters, see! I'll wear my crown again.
 
What, fear you not the fury of your king?--
But, hapless Edward, thou art fondly led;
They pass not for thy frowns as late they did,
But seek to make a new-elected king;
Which fills my mind with strange despairing thoughts,
Which thoughts are martyred with endless torments;
And in this torment comfort find I none,
But that I feel the crown upon my head;
And therefore let me wear it yet a while.
MALE
My, lord, the parliament must have present news;
And therefore say, will you resign or no?

MALE
I'll not resign, but, whilst I live, [be king].
Traitors, be gone, and join you with Mortimer.
Elect, conspire, install, do what you will:
Their blood and yours shall seal these treacheries.
MALE
This answer we'll return; and so, farewell.

MALE
Call them again, my lord, and speak them fair;
For, if they go, the prince shall lose his right.
MALE
Call thou them back; I have no power to speak.
MALE
My lord, the king is willing to resign.
MALE
If he be not, let him choose.
MALE
O, would I might! but heavens and earth conspire
To make me miserable.  Here, receive my crown.
Receive it? no, these innocent hands of mine
Shall not be guilty of so foul a crime;
He of you all that most desires my blood,
And will be call'd the murderer of a king,
Take it.  What, are you mov'd? pity you me?
Then send for unrelenting Mortimer,
And Isabel, whose eyes being turn'd to steel
Will sooner sparkle fire than shed a tear.
Yet stay; for, rather than I'll look on them,
Here, here! --Now, sweet God of heaven,
Make me despise this transitory pomp,
And sit fot aye enthronised in heaven!
Come, death, and with thy fingers close my eyes,
Or, if I live, let me forget myself!
MALE
My lord,--
MALE
Call me not lord; away, out of my sight!
Ah, pardon me! grief makes me lunatic.
Let not that Mortimer protect my son;
More safety there is in a tiger's jaws
Than his embracements.  Bear this to the queen,
Wet with my tears, and dried again with sighs:
 
If with the sight thereof she be not mov'd,
Return it back, and dip it in my blood.
Commend me to my son, and bid him rule
Better than I: yet how have I transgress'd,
Unless it be with too much clemency?
MALE
And thus, most humbly do we take our leave.
MALE
Farewell.
 
I know the next news that they bring
Will be my death; and welcome shall it be:
To wretched men death is felicity.
MALE
Another post! what news brings he?

MALE
Such news as I expect.--Come, Berkeley, come,
And tell thy message to my naked breast.
MALE
My lord, think not a thought so villanous
Can harbour in a man of noble birth.
To do your highness service and devoir,
And save you from your foes, Berkeley would die.
MALE
My lord, the council of the queen command
That I resign my charge.
MALE
And who must keep me now?  Must you, my lord?
MALE
Ay, my most gracious lord; so 'tis decreed.
MALE
 By Mortimer, whose name is written here!
Well may I rent his name that rends my heart. 
This poor revenge hath something eas'd my mind:
So may his limbs be torn as is this paper!
Hear me, immortal Jove, and grant it too!
MALE
Your grace must hence with me to Berkeley straight.
MALE
Whither you will: all places are alike,
And every earth is fit for burial.
MALE
Favour him, my lord, as much as lieth in you.
MALE
Even so betide my soul as I use him!
MALE
Mine enemy hath pitied my estate,
And that's the cause that I am now remov'd.
MALE
And thinks your grace that Berkeley will be cruel?
MALE
I know not; but of this am I assur'd,
That death ends all, and I can die but once.--
Leicester, farewell.
MALE
Not yet, my lord; I'll bear you on your way.

MALE
Fair Isabel, now have we our desire;
The proud corrupters of the light-brain'd king
Have done their homage to the lofty gallows,
And he himself lies in captivity.
Be rul'd by me, and we will rule the realm:
In any case take heed of childish fear,
For now we hold an old wolf by the ears,
That, if he slip, will seize upon us both,
And gripe the sorer, being grip'd himself.
Think therefore, madam, that imports us much
To erect your son with all the speed we may,
And that I be protector over him:
For our behoof, 'twill bear the greater sway
Whenas a king's name shall be under-writ.
FEMALE
Sweet Mortimer, the life of Isabel,
Be thou persuaded that I love thee well;
And therefore, so the prince my son be safe,
Whom I esteem as dear as these mine eyes,
Conclude against his father what thou wilt,
And I myself will willingly subscribe.
MALE
First would I hear news he were depos'd,
And then let me alone to handle him.

Letters! from whence?
MALE
From Killingworth, my lord?
FEMALE
How fares my lord the king?
MALE
In health, madam, but full of pensiveness.
FEMALE
Alas, poor soul, would I could ease his grief!

Thanks, gentle Winchester.--
 Sirrah, be gone.  
MALE
The king hath willingly resign'd his crown.
FEMALE
O, happy news! send for the prince my son.
MALE
Further, or this letter was seal'd, Lord Berkeley came,
So that he now is gone from Killingworth;
And we have heard that Edmund laid a plot
To set his brother free; nor more but so.
The Lord of Berkeley is so pitiful
As Leicester that had charge of him before.
FEMALE
Then let some other be his guardian.
MALE
Let me alone; here is the privy-seal,--

Who's there?  Call hither, Gurney and Matrevis.--
 
To dash the heavy-headed Edmund's drift,
Berkeley shall be discharg'd, the king remov'd,
And none but we shall know where he lieth.
FEMALE
But, Mortimer, as long as he survives,
What safety rests for us or for my son?
MALE
Speak, shall he presently be despatch'd and die?
FEMALE
I would he were, so 'twere not by my means!

MALE
Enough.--Matrevis, write a letter presently
Unto the Lord of Berkeley from ourself,
That he resign the king to thee and Gurney;
And, when 'tis done, we will subscribe our name.
MALE
It shall be done, my lord.
MALE
Gurney,--
MALE
My lord?
MALE
As thou intend'st to rise by Mortimer,
Who now makes Fortune's wheel turn as he please,
Seek all the means thou canst to make him droop,
And neither give him kind word nor good look.
MALE
I warrant you, my lord.
MALE
And this above the rest: because we hear
That Edmund casts to work his liberty,
Remove him still from place to place by night,
Till at the last he come to Killingworth,
And then from thence to Berkeley back again;
And by the way, to make him fret the more,
Speak curstly to him; and in any case
Let no man comfort him, if he chance to weep,
But amplify his grief with bitter words.
MALE
Fear not, my lord; we'll do as you command.
MALE
So, now away! post thitherwards amain.
FEMALE
Whither goes this letter? to my lord the king?
Commend me humbly to his majesty,
And tell him that I labour all in vain
To ease his grief and work his liberty;
And bear him this as witness of my love. 
MALE
I will, madam.  
MALE
Finely dissembled! do so still, sweet queen.
Here comes the young prince with the Earl of Kent.
FEMALE
Something he whispers in his childish ears.
MALE
If he have such access unto the prince,
Our plots and stratagems will soon be dash'd.
FEMALE
Use Edmund friendly, as if all were well.

MALE
How fares my honourable Lord of Kent?
MALE
In health, sweet Mortimer.--How fares your grace?
FEMALE
Well, if my lord your brother were enlarg'd.
MALE
I hear of late he hath depos'd himself.
FEMALE
The more my grief.
MALE
And mine.
MALE
Ah, they do dissemble! 
FEMALE
Sweet son, come hither; I must talk with thee.
MALE
You, being his uncle and the next of blood,
Do look to be protector o'er the prince.
MALE
Not I, my lord: who should protect the son,
But she that gave him life?  I mean the queen.
MALE
Mother, persuade me not to wear the crown:
Let him be king; I am too young to reign.
FEMALE
But be content, seeing 'tis his highness' pleasure.
MALE
Let me but see him first, and then I will.
MALE
Ay, do, sweet nephew.
FEMALE
Brother, you know it is impossible.
MALE
Why, is he dead?
FEMALE
No, God forbid!
MALE
I would those words proceeded from your heart!
MALE
Inconstant Edmund, dost thou favour him,
That wast a cause of his imprisonment?
MALE
The more cause now have I to make amends.
MALE

I tell thee, 'tis not meet that one so false
Should come about the person of a prince.--
My lord, he hath betray'd the king his brother,
And therefore trust him not.
MALE
But he repents, and sorrows for it now.
FEMALE
Come, son, and go with this gentle lord and me.
MALE
With you I will, but not with Mortimer.
MALE
Why, youngling, 'sdain'st thou so of Mortimer?
Then I will carry thee by force away.
MALE
Help, uncle Kent! Mortimer will wrong me.
FEMALE
Brother Edmund, strive not; we are his friends;
Isabel is nearer than the Earl of Kent.
MALE
Sister, Edward is my charge; redeem him.
FEMALE
Edward is my son, and I will keep him.
MALE
Mortimer shall know that he hath wronged me.
Hence will I haste to Killingworth Castle,
And rescue aged Edward from his foes,
To be reveng'd on Mortimer and thee. 

MALE
My lord, be not pensive; we are your friends:
Men are ordain'd to live in misery;
Therefore, come; dalliance dangereth our lives.
MALE
Friends, whither must unhappy Edward go?
Will hateful Mortimer appoint no rest?
Must I be vexed like the nightly bird,
Whose sight is loathsome to all winged fowls?
When will the fury of his mind assuage?
When will his heart be satisfied with blood?
If mine will serve, unbowel straight this breast,
And give my heart to Isabel and him:
It is the chiefest mark they level at.
MALE
Not so, my liege: the queen hath given this charge,
To keep your grace in safety:
Your passions make your dolours to increase.
MALE
This usage makes my misery increase.
But can my air of life continue long,
When all my senses are annoy'd with stench?
Within a dungeon England's king is kept,
Where I am starv'd for want of sustenance;
My daily diet is heart-breaking sobs,
That almost rent the closet of my heart:
Thus lives old Edward not reliev'd by any,
And so must die, though pitied by many.
O, water, gentle friends, to cool my thirst,
And clear my body from foul excrements!
MALE
Here's channel-water, as our charge is given:
Sit down, for we'll be barbers to your grace.
MALE
Traitors, away! what, will you murder me,
Of choke your sovereign with puddle-water?
MALE
No, but wash your face, and shave away your beard,
Lest you be known, and so be rescued.
MALE
Why strive you thus? your labour is in vain.
MALE
The wren may strive against the lion's strength,
But all in vain: so vainly do I strive
To seek for mercy at a tyrant's hand.
 
Immortal powers, that know the painful cares
That wait upon my poor distressed soul,
O, level all your looks upon these daring men
That wrong their liege and sovereign, England's king!
O Gaveston, it is for thee that I am wrong'd!
For me both thou and both the Spensers died;
And for your sakes a thousand wrongs I'll take.
The Spensers' ghosts, wherever they remain,
Wish well to mine; then, tush, for them I'll die.
MALE
'Twixt theirs and yours shall be no enmity.
Come, come, away!  Now put the torches out:
We'll enter in by darkness to Killingworth.
MALE
How now! who comes there?

MALE
Guard the king sure: it is the Earl of Kent.
MALE
O gentle brother, help to rescue me!
MALE
Keep them asunder; thrust in the king.
MALE
Soldiers, let me but talk to him one word.
MALE
Lay hands upon the earl for his assault.
MALE
Lay down your weapons, traitors! yield the king!
MALE
Edmund, yield thou thyself, or thou shalt die.
MALE
Base villains, wherefore do you gripe me thus?
MALE
Bind him, and so convey him to the court.
MALE
Where is the court but here? here is the king
And I will visit him: why stay you me?
MALE
The court is where Lord Mortimer remains:
Thither shall your honour go; and so, farewell.
  
MALE
O, miserable is that common-weal,
Where lords keep courts, and kings are lock'd in prison!
MALE
Wherefore stay we? on, sirs, to the court!
MALE
Ay, lead me whither you will, even to my death,
Seeing that my brother cannot be releas'd.

MALE
The king must die, or Mortimer goes down;
The commons now begin to pity him:
Yet he that is the cause of Edward's death,
Is sure to pay for it when his son's of age;
And therefore will I do it cunningly.
This letter, written by a friend of ours,
Contains his death, yet bids then save his life;
 
Edwardum occidere nolite timere, bonum est,
Fear not to kill the king, 'tis good he die:
But read it thus, and that's another sense;
Edwardum occidere nolite, timere bonum est,
Kill not the king, 'tis good to fear the worst.
Unpointed as it is, thus shall it go.
That, being dead, if it chance to be found,
Matrevis and the rest may bear the blame,
And we be quit that caus'd it to be done.
Within this room is lock'd the messenger
That shall convey it, and perform the rest;
And, by a secret token that he bears,
Shall he be murder'd when the deed is done.--
Lightborn, come forth!

Art thou so resolute as thou wast?
MALE
What else, my lord? and far more resolute.
MALE
And hast thou cast how to accomplish it?
MALE
Ay, ay; and none shall know which way he died.
MALE
But at his looks, Lightborn, thou wilt relent.
MALE
Relent! ha, ha! I use much to relent.
MALE
Well, do it bravely, and be secret.
MALE
You shall not need to give instructions;
'Tis not the first time I have kill'd a man:
I learn'd in Naples how to poison flowers;
To strangle with a lawn thrust down the throat;
To pierce the wind pipe with a needle's point;
Or, whilst one is asleep, to take a quill,
And blow a little powder in his ears;
Or open his mouth, and pour quick-silver down.
But yet I have a braver way than these.
MALE
What's that?
MALE
Nay, you shall pardon me; none shall know my tricks.
MALE
I care not how it is, so it be not spied.
Deliver this to Gurney and Matrevis:
At every ten-mile end thou hast a horse:
Take this : away, and never see me more!
MALE
No?
MALE
No; unless thou bring me news of Edward's death.
MALE
That will I quickly do.  Farewell, my lord. 
MALE
The prince I rule, the queen do I command,
And with a lowly congé to the ground
The proudest lords salute me as I pass;
I seal, I cancel, I do what I will.
Fear'd am I more than lov'd;--let me be fear'd,
And, when I frown, make all the court look pale.
I view the prince with Aristarchus' eyes,
Whose looks were as a breeching to a boy.
They thrust upon me the protectorship,
And sue to me for that that I desire;
While at the council-table, grave enough,
And not unlike a bashful puritan,
First I complain of imbecility,
Saying it is onus quam gravissimum;
Till, being interrupted by my friends,
Suscepi that provinciam, as they term it;
And, to conclude, I am Protector now.
Now all is sure: the queen and Mortimer
Shall rule the realm, the king; and none rule us.
Mine enemies will I plague, my friends advance;
And what I list command who dare control?
Major sum quàm cui possit fortuna nocere:
And that this be the coronation-day,
It pleaseth me and Isabel the queen.
The trumpets sound; I must go take my place.

MALE
Long live King Edward, by the grace of God
King of England and Lord of Ireland!
MALE
If any Christian, Heathen, Turk, or Jew,
Dares but affirm that Edward's not true king,
And will avouch his saying with the sword,
I am the Champion that will combat him.
MALE
None comes: sound, trumpets!  
MALE
Champion, here's to thee. 
FEMALE
Lord Mortimer, now take him to your charge.

MALE
What traitor have we there with blades and bills?
MALE
Edmund the Earl of Kent.
MALE
What hath he done?
MALE
'A would have taken the king away perforce,
As we were bringing him to Killingworth.
MALE
Did you attempt his rescue, Edmund? speak.
MALE
Mortimer, I did: he is our king,
And thou compell'st this prince to wear the crown.
MALE
Strike off his head: he shall have martial law.
MALE
Strike off my head! base traitor, I defy thee!
MALE
My lord, he is my uncle, and shall live.
MALE
My lord, he is your enemy, and shall die.
MALE
Stay, villains!
MALE
Sweet mother, if I cannot pardon him,
Entreat my Lord Protector for his life.
FEMALE
Son, be content: I dare not speak a word.
MALE
Nor I; and yet methinks I should command:
But, seeing I cannot, I'll entreat for him.--
My lord, if you will let my uncle live,
I will requite it when I come to age.
MALE
'Tis for your highness' good and for the realm's.--
How often shall I bid you bear him hence?
MALE
Art thou king? must I die at thy command?
MALE
At our command.--Once more, away with him!
MALE
Let me but stay and speak; I will not go:
Either my brother or his son is king,
And none of both them thirst for Edmund's blood:
And therefore, soldiers, whither will you hale me?
 
MALE
What safety may I look for at his hands,
If that my uncle shall be murder'd thus?
FEMALE
Fear not, sweet boy; I'll guard thee from thy foes:
Had Edmund liv'd, he would have sought thy death.
Come, son, we'll ride a-hunting in the park.
MALE
And shall my uncle Edmund ride with us?
FEMALE
He is a traitor; think not on him: come.

MALE
Gurney, I wonder the king dies not,
Being in a vault up to the knees in water,
To which the channels of the castle run,
From whence a damp continually ariseth,
That were enough to poison any man,
Much more a king, brought up so tenderly.
MALE
And so do I, Matrevis: yesternight
I open'd but the door to throw him meat,
And I was almost stifled with the savour.
MALE
He hath a body able to endure
More than we can inflict: and therefore now
Let us assail his mind another while.
MALE
Send for him out thence, and I will anger him.
MALE
But stay; who's this?

MALE
My Lord Protector greets you. 
MALE
What's there?  I know not how to construe it.
MALE
Gurney, it was left unpointed for the nonce;
Edwardum occidere nolite timere,
That's his meaning.
MALE
Know you this token?  I must have the king.
MALE
Ay, stay a while; thou shalt have answer straight.--
This villain's sent to make away the king.
MALE
I thought as much.
MALE
And, when the murder's done,
See how he must be handled for his labour,--
Pereat iste!  Let him have the king;
What else?--Here is the keys, this is the lake:
Do as you are commanded by my lord.
MALE
I know what I must do.  Get you away:
Yet be not far off; I shall need your help:
See that in the next room I have a fire,
And get me a spit, and let it be red-hot.
MALE
Very well.
MALE
Need you anything besides?
MALE
What else? a table and a feather-bed.
MALE
That's all?
MALE
Ay, ay: so, when I call you, bring it in.
MALE
Fear not thou that.
MALE
Here's a light to go into the dungeon.
 
MALE
So, now.
Must I about this gear: ne'er was there any
So finely handled as this king shall be.--
Foh, here's a place indeed with all my heart!
MALE
Who's there? what light is that? wherefore com'st thou?
MALE
To comfort you, and bring you joyful news.
MALE
Small comfort finds poor Edward in thy looks:
Villain, I know thou com'st to murder me.
MALE
To murder you, my most gracious lord?
Far is it from my heart to do you harm.
The queen sent me to see how you were us'd,
For she relents at this your misery:
And what eye can refrain from shedding tears,
To see a king in this most piteous state?
MALE
Weep'st thou already? list a while to me,
And then thy heart, were it as Gurney's is,
Or as Matrevis', hewn from the Caucasus,
Yet will it melt ere I have done my tale.
This dungeon where they keep me is the sink
Wherein the filth of all the castle falls.
MALE
O villains!
MALE
And there, in mire and puddle, have I stood
This ten days' space; and, lest that I should sleep,
One plays continually upon a drum;
They give me bread and water, being a king;
So that, for want of sleep and sustenance,
My mind's distemper'd, and my body's numb'd,
And whether I have limbs or no I know not.
O, would my blood dropp'd out from every vein,
As doth this water from my tatter'd robes!
Tell Isabel the queen, I look'd not thus,
When for her sake I ran at tilt in France,
And there unhors'd the Duke of Cleremont.
MALE
O, speak no more, my lord! this breaks my heart.
Lie on this bed, and rest yourself a while.
MALE
These looks of thine can harbour naught but death;
I see my tragedy written in thy brows.
Yet stay a while; forbear thy bloody hand,
And let me see the stroke before it comes,
That even then when I shall lose my life,
My mind may be more steadfast on my God.
MALE
What means your highness to mistrust me thus?
MALE
What mean'st thou to dissemble with me thus?
MALE
These hands were never stain'd with innocent blood,
Nor shall they now be tainted with a king's.
MALE
Forgive my thought for having such a thought.
One jewel have I left; receive thou this:  
Still fear I, and I know not what's the cause,
But every joint shakes as I give it thee.
O, if thou harbour'st murder in thy heart,
Let this gift change thy mind, and save thy soul!
Know that I am a king: O, at that name
I feel a hell of grief! where is my crown?
Gone, gone! and do I [still] remain alive?
MALE
You're overwatch'd, my lord: lie down and rest.
MALE
But that grief keeps me waking, I should sleep;
For not these ten days have these eye-lids clos'd.
Now, as I speak, they fall; and yet with fear
Open again.  O, wherefore sitt'st thou here?
MALE
If you mistrust me, I'll be gone, my lord.
MALE
No, no; for, if thou mean'st to murder me,
Thou wilt return again; and therefore stay.  
MALE
He sleeps.
MALE
O, let me not die yet!  O, stay a while!
MALE
How now, my lord!
MALE
Something still buzzeth in mine ears,
And tells me, if I sleep, I never wake:
This fear is that which makes me tremble thus;
And therefore tell me, wherefore art thou come?
MALE
To rid thee of thy life.--Matrevis, come!

MALE
I am too weak and feeble to resist.--
Assist me, sweet God, and receive my soul!
MALE
Run for the table.
MALE
O, spare me, or despatch me in a trice!
MALE
So, lay the table down, and stamp on it,
But not too hard, lest that you bruise his body.
MALE
I fear me that this cry will raise the town,
And therefore let us take horse and away.
MALE
Tell me, sirs, was it not bravely done?
MALE
Excellent well: take this for thy reward.
  
Come, let us cast the body in the moat,
And bear the king's to Mortimer our lord:
Away!

MALE
Is't done, Matrevis, and the murderer dead?
MALE
Ay, my good lord: I would it were undone!
MALE
Matrevis, if thou now grow'st penitent,
I'll be thy ghostly father; therefore choose,
Whether thou wilt be secret in this,
Or else die by the hand of Mortimer.
MALE
Gurney, my lord, is fled, and will, I fear,
Betray us both; therefore let me fly.
MALE
Fly to the savages!
MALE
I humbly thank your honour. 
MALE
As for myself, I stand as Jove's huge tree,
And others are but shrubs compar'd to me:
All tremble at my name, and I fear none:
Let's see who dare impeach me for his death!

FEMALE
Ah, Mortimer, the king my son hath news,
His father's dead, and we have murder'd him!
MALE
What if he have? the king is yet a child.
FEMALE
Ay, but he tears his hair, and wrings his hands,
And vows to be reveng'd upon us both.
Into the council-chamber he is gone,
To crave the aid and succour of his peers.
Ay me, see where he comes, and they with him!
Now, Mortimer, begins our tragedy.

MALE
Fear not, my lord; know that you are a king.
MALE
Villain!--
MALE
Ho, now, my lord!
MALE
Think not that I am frighted with thy words:
My father's murder'd through thy treachery;
And thou shalt die, and on his mournful hearse
Thy hateful and accursed head shall lie,
To witness to the world that by thy means
His kingly body was too soon interr'd.
FEMALE
Weep not, sweet son.
MALE
Forbid not me to weep; he was my father;
And had you lov'd him half so well as I,
You could not bear his death thus patiently:
But you, I fear, conspir'd with Mortimer.
MALE
Why speak you not unto my lord the king?
MALE
Because I think scorn to be accus'd.
Who is the man dares say I murder'd him?
MALE
Traitor, in me my loving father speaks,
And plainly saith, 'twas thou that murder'dst him.
MALE
But hath your grace no other proof than this?
MALE
Yes, if this be the hand of Mortimer.
 
MALE
False Gurney hath betray'd me and himself.
 
FEMALE
I fear'd as much: murder can not be hid.
MALE
It is my hand; what gather you by this?
MALE
That thither thou didst send a murderer.
MALE
What murderer? bring forth the man I sent.
MALE
Ah, Mortimer, thou know'st that he is slain!
And so shalt thou be too.--Why stays he here?
Bring him unto a hurdle, drag him forth;
Hang him, I say, and set his quarters up:
And bring his head back presently to me.
FEMALE
For my sake, sweet son, pity Mortimer!
MALE
Madam, entreat not: I will rather die
Than sue for life unto a paltry boy.
MALE
Hence with the traitor, with the murderer!
MALE
Base Fortune, now I see, that in thy wheel
There is a point, to which when men aspire,
They tumble headlong down: that point I touch'd,
And, seeing there was no place to mount up higher,
Why should I grieve at my declining fall?--
Farewell, fair queen: weep not for Mortimer,
That scorns the world, and, as a traveller,
Goes to discover countries yet unknown.
MALE
What, suffer you the traitor to delay?

some of the Attendants.
FEMALE
As thou receivest thy life from me,
Spill not the blood of gentle Mortimer!
MALE
This argues that you spilt my father's blood,
Else would you not entreat for Mortimer.
FEMALE
I spill his blood! no.
MALE
Ay, madam, you; for so the rumour runs.
FEMALE
That rumour is untrue: for loving thee,
Is this report rais'd on poor Isabel.
MALE
I do not think her so unnatural.
MALE
My lord, I fear me it will prove too true.
MALE
Mother, you are suspected for his death
And therefore we commit you to the Tower,
Till further trial may be made thereof.
If you be guilty, though I be your son,
Think not to find me slack or pitiful.
FEMALE
Nay, to my death; for too long have I liv'd,
Whenas my son thinks to abridge my days.
MALE
Away with her! her words enforce these tears,
And I shall pity her, if she speak again.
FEMALE
Shall I not mourn for my beloved lord?
And with the rest accompany him to his grave.
MALE
Thus, madam, 'tis the king's will you shall hence.
FEMALE
He hath forgotten me: stay; I am his mother.
MALE
That boots not; therefore, gentle madam, go.
FEMALE
Then come, sweet death, and rid me of this grief!


MALE
My lord, here is the head of Mortimer.
MALE
Go fetch my father's hearse, where it shall lie;
And bring my funeral robes. 
  Accursed head,
Could I have rul'd thee then, as I do now,
Thou hadst not hatch'd this monstrous treachery!--
Here comes the hearse: help me to mourn, my lords.



Sweet father, here unto thy murder'd ghost
I offer up the wicked traitor's head;
And let these tears, distilling from mine eyes,
Be witness of my grief and innocency.
