In sooth ||comma|| I know not why I am so sad:
It wearies me ||semicolon|| you say it wearies you ||semicolon|| 
But how I caught it ||comma|| found it ||comma|| or came by it ||comma|| 
What stuff ||single_quote|| tis made of ||comma|| whereof it is born ||comma|| 
I am to learn ||semicolon|| 
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me ||comma|| 
That I have much ado to know myself ||period|| 
Your mind is tossing on the ocean ||semicolon|| 
There ||comma|| where your argosies with portly sail ||comma|| 
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood ||comma|| 
Or ||comma|| as it were ||comma|| the pageants of the sea ||comma|| 
Do overpeer the petty traffickers ||comma|| 
That curtsy to them ||comma|| do them reverence ||comma|| 
As they fly by them with their woven wings ||period|| 
Believe me ||comma|| sir ||comma|| had I such venture forth ||comma|| 
The better part of my affections would
Be with my hopes abroad ||period|| I should be still
Plucking the grass ||comma|| to know where sits the wind ||comma|| 
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads ||semicolon|| 
And every object that might make me fear
Misfortune to my ventures ||comma|| out of doubt
Would make me sad ||period|| 
My wind cooling my broth
Would blow me to an ague ||comma|| when I thought
What harm a wind too great at sea might do ||period|| 
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run ||comma|| 
But I should think of shallows and of flats ||comma|| 
And see my wealthy Andrew dock ||single_quote|| d in sand ||comma|| 
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
To kiss her burial ||period|| Should I go to church
And see the holy edifice of stone ||comma|| 
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks ||comma|| 
Which touching but my gentle vessel ||single_quote|| s side ||comma|| 
Would scatter all her spices on the stream ||comma|| 
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks ||comma|| 
And ||comma|| in a word ||comma|| but even now worth this ||comma|| 
And now worth nothing ||question_mark|| Shall I have the thought
To think on this ||comma|| and shall I lack the thought
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad ||question_mark|| 
But tell not me ||semicolon|| I know ||comma|| Antonio
Is sad to think upon his merchandise ||period|| 
Believe me ||comma|| no: I thank my fortune for it ||comma|| 
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted ||comma|| 
Nor to one place ||semicolon|| nor is my whole estate
Upon the fortune of this present year:
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad ||period|| 
Why ||comma|| then you are in love ||period|| 
Fie ||comma|| fie ||exclamation_mark|| 
Not in love neither ||question_mark|| Then let us say you are sad ||comma|| 
Because you are not merry: and ||single_quote|| twere as easy
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry ||comma|| 
Because you are not sad ||period|| Now ||comma|| by two-headed Janus ||comma|| 
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper ||comma|| 
And other of such vinegar aspect
That they ||single_quote|| ll not show their teeth in way of smile ||comma|| 
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable ||period|| 
Here comes Bassanio ||comma|| your most noble kinsman ||comma|| 
Gratiano and Lorenzo ||period|| Fare ye well:
We leave you now with better company ||period|| 
I would have stay ||single_quote|| d till I had made you merry ||comma|| 
If worthier friends had not prevented me ||period|| 
Your worth is very dear in my regard ||period|| 
I take it ||comma|| your own business calls on you
And you embrace the occasion to depart ||period|| 
Good morrow ||comma|| my good lords ||period|| 
Good signiors both ||comma|| when shall we laugh ||question_mark|| say ||comma|| when ||question_mark|| 
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so ||question_mark|| 
We ||single_quote|| ll make our leisures to attend on yours ||period|| 
My Lord Bassanio ||comma|| since you have found Antonio ||comma|| 
We two will leave you: but at dinner-time ||comma|| 
I pray you ||comma|| have in mind where we must meet ||period|| 
I will not fail you ||period|| 
You look not well ||comma|| Signior Antonio ||semicolon|| 
You have too much respect upon the world:
They lose it that do buy it with much care:
Believe me ||comma|| you are marvellously changed ||period|| 
I hold the world but as the world ||comma|| Gratiano ||semicolon|| 
A stage where every man must play a part ||comma|| 
And mine a sad one ||period|| 
Let me play the fool:
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come ||comma|| 
And let my liver rather heat with wine
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans ||period|| 
Why should a man ||comma|| whose blood is warm within ||comma|| 
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster ||question_mark|| 
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
By being peevish ||question_mark|| I tell thee what ||comma|| Antonio ||dash|| 
I love thee ||comma|| and it is my love that speaks ||dash|| 
There are a sort of men whose visages
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond ||comma|| 
And do a wilful stillness entertain ||comma|| 
With purpose to be dress ||single_quote|| d in an opinion
Of wisdom ||comma|| gravity ||comma|| profound conceit ||comma|| 
As who should say ||single_quote|| I am Sir Oracle ||comma|| 
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark ||exclamation_mark|| ||single_quote|| 
O my Antonio ||comma|| I do know of these
That therefore only are reputed wise
For saying nothing ||semicolon|| when ||comma|| I am very sure ||comma|| 
If they should speak ||comma|| would almost damn those ears ||comma|| 
Which ||comma|| hearing them ||comma|| would call their brothers fools ||period|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll tell thee more of this another time:
But fish not ||comma|| with this melancholy bait ||comma|| 
For this fool gudgeon ||comma|| this opinion ||period|| 
Come ||comma|| good Lorenzo ||period|| Fare ye well awhile:
I ||single_quote|| ll end my exhortation after dinner ||period|| 
Well ||comma|| we will leave you then till dinner-time:
I must be one of these same dumb wise men ||comma|| 
For Gratiano never lets me speak ||period|| 
Well ||comma|| keep me company but two years moe ||comma|| 
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue ||period|| 
Farewell: I ||single_quote|| ll grow a talker for this gear ||period|| 
Thanks ||comma|| i ||single_quote|| faith ||comma|| for silence is only commendable
In a neat ||single_quote|| s tongue dried and a maid not vendible ||period|| 
Is that any thing now ||question_mark|| 
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing ||comma|| more
than any man in all Venice ||period|| His reasons are as two
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
shall seek all day ere you find them ||comma|| and when you
have them ||comma|| they are not worth the search ||period|| 
Well ||comma|| tell me now what lady is the same
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage ||comma|| 
That you to-day promised to tell me of ||question_mark|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis not unknown to you ||comma|| Antonio ||comma|| 
How much I have disabled mine estate ||comma|| 
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance:
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
From such a noble rate ||semicolon|| but my chief care
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time something too prodigal
Hath left me gaged ||period|| To you ||comma|| Antonio ||comma|| 
I owe the most ||comma|| in money and in love ||comma|| 
And from your love I have a warranty
To unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe ||period|| 
I pray you ||comma|| good Bassanio ||comma|| let me know it ||semicolon|| 
And if it stand ||comma|| as you yourself still do ||comma|| 
Within the eye of honour ||comma|| be assured ||comma|| 
My purse ||comma|| my person ||comma|| my extremest means ||comma|| 
Lie all unlock ||single_quote|| d to your occasions ||period|| 
In my school-days ||comma|| when I had lost one shaft ||comma|| 
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
The self-same way with more advised watch ||comma|| 
To find the other forth ||comma|| and by adventuring both
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof ||comma|| 
Because what follows is pure innocence ||period|| 
I owe you much ||comma|| and ||comma|| like a wilful youth ||comma|| 
That which I owe is lost ||semicolon|| but if you please
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first ||comma|| I do not doubt ||comma|| 
As I will watch the aim ||comma|| or to find both
Or bring your latter hazard back again
And thankfully rest debtor for the first ||period|| 
You know me well ||comma|| and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance ||semicolon|| 
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost
Than if you had made waste of all I have:
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowledge may by me be done ||comma|| 
And I am prest unto it: therefore ||comma|| speak ||period|| 
In Belmont is a lady richly left ||semicolon|| 
And she is fair ||comma|| and ||comma|| fairer than that word ||comma|| 
Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages:
Her name is Portia ||comma|| nothing undervalued
To Cato ||single_quote|| s daughter ||comma|| Brutus ||single_quote|| Portia:
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth ||comma|| 
For the four winds blow in from every coast
Renowned suitors ||comma|| and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece ||semicolon|| 
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos ||single_quote|| strand ||comma|| 
And many Jasons come in quest of her ||period|| 
O my Antonio ||comma|| had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them ||comma|| 
I have a mind presages me such thrift ||comma|| 
That I should questionless be fortunate ||exclamation_mark|| 
Thou know ||single_quote|| st that all my fortunes are at sea ||semicolon|| 
Neither have I money nor commodity
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth ||semicolon|| 
Try what my credit can in Venice do:
That shall be rack ||single_quote|| d ||comma|| even to the uttermost ||comma|| 
To furnish thee to Belmont ||comma|| to fair Portia ||period|| 
Go ||comma|| presently inquire ||comma|| and so will I ||comma|| 
Where money is ||comma|| and I no question make
To have it of my trust or for my sake ||period|| 
By my troth ||comma|| Nerissa ||comma|| my little body is aweary of
this great world ||period|| 
You would be ||comma|| sweet madam ||comma|| if your miseries were in
the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
yet ||comma|| for aught I see ||comma|| they are as sick that surfeit
with too much as they that starve with nothing ||period|| It
is no mean happiness therefore ||comma|| to be seated in the
mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs ||comma|| but
competency lives longer ||period|| 
Good sentences and well pronounced ||period|| 
They would be better ||comma|| if well followed ||period|| 
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
do ||comma|| chapels had been churches and poor men ||single_quote|| s
cottages princes ||single_quote|| palaces ||period|| It is a good divine that
follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
twenty what were good to be done ||comma|| than be one of the
twenty to follow mine own teaching ||period|| The brain may
devise laws for the blood ||comma|| but a hot temper leaps
o ||single_quote|| er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
youth ||comma|| to skip o ||single_quote|| er the meshes of good counsel the
cripple ||period|| But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose me a husband ||period|| O me ||comma|| the word ||single_quote|| choose ||exclamation_mark|| ||single_quote|| I may
neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
dislike ||semicolon|| so is the will of a living daughter curbed
by the will of a dead father ||period|| Is it not hard ||comma|| 
Nerissa ||comma|| that I cannot choose one nor refuse none ||question_mark|| 
Your father was ever virtuous ||semicolon|| and holy men at their
death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery ||comma|| 
that he hath devised in these three chests of gold ||comma|| 
silver and lead ||comma|| whereof who chooses his meaning
chooses you ||comma|| will ||comma|| no doubt ||comma|| never be chosen by any
rightly but one who shall rightly love ||period|| But what
warmth is there in your affection towards any of
these princely suitors that are already come ||question_mark|| 
I pray thee ||comma|| over-name them ||semicolon|| and as thou namest
them ||comma|| I will describe them ||semicolon|| and ||comma|| according to my
description ||comma|| level at my affection ||period|| 
First ||comma|| there is the Neapolitan prince ||period|| 
Ay ||comma|| that ||single_quote|| s a colt indeed ||comma|| for he doth nothing but
talk of his horse ||semicolon|| and he makes it a great
appropriation to his own good parts ||comma|| that he can
shoe him himself ||period|| I am much afeard my lady his
mother played false with a smith ||period|| 
Then there is the County Palatine ||period|| 
He doth nothing but frown ||comma|| as who should say ||single_quote|| If you
will not have me ||comma|| choose: ||single_quote|| he hears merry tales and
smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
philosopher when he grows old ||comma|| being so full of
unmannerly sadness in his youth ||period|| I had rather be
married to a death ||single_quote|| s-head with a bone in his mouth
than to either of these ||period|| God defend me from these
two ||exclamation_mark|| 
How say you by the French lord ||comma|| Monsieur Le Bon ||question_mark|| 
God made him ||comma|| and therefore let him pass for a man ||period|| 
In truth ||comma|| I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but ||comma|| 
he ||exclamation_mark|| why ||comma|| he hath a horse better than the
Neapolitan ||single_quote|| s ||comma|| a better bad habit of frowning than
the Count Palatine ||semicolon|| he is every man in no man ||semicolon|| if a
throstle sing ||comma|| he falls straight a capering: he will
fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him ||comma|| I
should marry twenty husbands ||period|| If he would despise me
I would forgive him ||comma|| for if he love me to madness ||comma|| I
shall never requite him ||period|| 
What say you ||comma|| then ||comma|| to Falconbridge ||comma|| the young baron
of England ||question_mark|| 
You know I say nothing to him ||comma|| for he understands
not me ||comma|| nor I him: he hath neither Latin ||comma|| French ||comma|| 
nor Italian ||comma|| and you will come into the court and
swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English ||period|| 
He is a proper man ||single_quote|| s picture ||comma|| but ||comma|| alas ||comma|| who can
converse with a dumb-show ||question_mark|| How oddly he is suited ||exclamation_mark|| 
I think he bought his doublet in Italy ||comma|| his round
hose in France ||comma|| his bonnet in Germany and his
behavior every where ||period|| 
What think you of the Scottish lord ||comma|| his neighbour ||question_mark|| 
That he hath a neighbourly charity in him ||comma|| for he
borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
under for another ||period|| 
How like you the young German ||comma|| the Duke of Saxony ||single_quote|| s nephew ||question_mark|| 
Very vilely in the morning ||comma|| when he is sober ||comma|| and
most vilely in the afternoon ||comma|| when he is drunk: when
he is best ||comma|| he is a little worse than a man ||comma|| and
when he is worst ||comma|| he is little better than a beast:
and the worst fall that ever fell ||comma|| I hope I shall
make shift to go without him ||period|| 
If he should offer to choose ||comma|| and choose the right
casket ||comma|| you should refuse to perform your father ||single_quote|| s
will ||comma|| if you should refuse to accept him ||period|| 
Therefore ||comma|| for fear of the worst ||comma|| I pray thee ||comma|| set a
deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket ||comma|| 
for if the devil be within and that temptation
without ||comma|| I know he will choose it ||period|| I will do any
thing ||comma|| Nerissa ||comma|| ere I ||single_quote|| ll be married to a sponge ||period|| 
You need not fear ||comma|| lady ||comma|| the having any of these
lords: they have acquainted me with their
determinations ||semicolon|| which is ||comma|| indeed ||comma|| to return to their
home and to trouble you with no more suit ||comma|| unless
you may be won by some other sort than your father ||single_quote|| s
imposition depending on the caskets ||period|| 
If I live to be as old as Sibylla ||comma|| I will die as
chaste as Diana ||comma|| unless I be obtained by the manner
of my father ||single_quote|| s will ||period|| I am glad this parcel of wooers
are so reasonable ||comma|| for there is not one among them
but I dote on his very absence ||comma|| and I pray God grant
them a fair departure ||period|| 
Do you not remember ||comma|| lady ||comma|| in your father ||single_quote|| s time ||comma|| a
Venetian ||comma|| a scholar and a soldier ||comma|| that came hither
in company of the Marquis of Montferrat ||question_mark|| 
Yes ||comma|| yes ||comma|| it was Bassanio ||semicolon|| as I think ||comma|| he was so called ||period|| 
True ||comma|| madam: he ||comma|| of all the men that ever my foolish
eyes looked upon ||comma|| was the best deserving a fair lady ||period|| 
I remember him well ||comma|| and I remember him worthy of
thy praise ||period|| 
How now ||exclamation_mark|| what news ||question_mark|| 
The four strangers seek for you ||comma|| madam ||comma|| to take
their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
fifth ||comma|| the Prince of Morocco ||comma|| who brings word the
prince his master will be here to-night ||period|| 
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
heart as I can bid the other four farewell ||comma|| I should
be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
of a saint and the complexion of a devil ||comma|| I had
rather he should shrive me than wive me ||period|| Come ||comma|| 
Nerissa ||period|| Sirrah ||comma|| go before ||period|| 
Whiles we shut the gates
upon one wooer ||comma|| another knocks at the door ||period|| 
Three thousand ducats ||semicolon|| well ||period|| 
Ay ||comma|| sir ||comma|| for three months ||period|| 
For three months ||semicolon|| well ||period|| 
For the which ||comma|| as I told you ||comma|| Antonio shall be bound ||period|| 
Antonio shall become bound ||semicolon|| well ||period|| 
May you stead me ||question_mark|| will you pleasure me ||question_mark|| shall I
know your answer ||question_mark|| 
Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound ||period|| 
Your answer to that ||period|| 
Antonio is a good man ||period|| 
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary ||question_mark|| 
Oh ||comma|| no ||comma|| no ||comma|| no ||comma|| no: my meaning in saying he is a
good man is to have you understand me that he is
sufficient ||period|| Yet his means are in supposition: he
hath an argosy bound to Tripolis ||comma|| another to the
Indies ||semicolon|| I understand moreover ||comma|| upon the Rialto ||comma|| he
hath a third at Mexico ||comma|| a fourth for England ||comma|| and
other ventures he hath ||comma|| squandered abroad ||period|| But ships
are but boards ||comma|| sailors but men: there be land-rats
and water-rats ||comma|| water-thieves and land-thieves ||comma|| I
mean pirates ||comma|| and then there is the peril of waters ||comma|| 
winds and rocks ||period|| The man is ||comma|| notwithstanding ||comma|| 
sufficient ||period|| Three thousand ducats ||semicolon|| I think I may
take his bond ||period|| 
Be assured you may ||period|| 
I will be assured I may ||semicolon|| and ||comma|| that I may be assured ||comma|| 
I will bethink me ||period|| May I speak with Antonio ||question_mark|| 
If it please you to dine with us ||period|| 
Yes ||comma|| to smell pork ||semicolon|| to eat of the habitation which
your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into ||period|| I
will buy with you ||comma|| sell with you ||comma|| talk with you ||comma|| 
walk with you ||comma|| and so following ||comma|| but I will not eat
with you ||comma|| drink with you ||comma|| nor pray with you ||period|| What
news on the Rialto ||question_mark|| Who is he comes here ||question_mark|| 
This is Signior Antonio ||period|| 
[Aside] How like a fawning publican he looks ||exclamation_mark|| 
I hate him for he is a Christian ||comma|| 
But more for that in low simplicity
He lends out money gratis and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice ||period|| 
If I can catch him once upon the hip ||comma|| 
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him ||period|| 
He hates our sacred nation ||comma|| and he rails ||comma|| 
Even there where merchants most do congregate ||comma|| 
On me ||comma|| my bargains and my well-won thrift ||comma|| 
Which he calls interest ||period|| Cursed be my tribe ||comma|| 
If I forgive him ||exclamation_mark|| 
Shylock ||comma|| do you hear ||question_mark|| 
I am debating of my present store ||comma|| 
And ||comma|| by the near guess of my memory ||comma|| 
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Of full three thousand ducats ||period|| What of that ||question_mark|| 
Tubal ||comma|| a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe ||comma|| 
Will furnish me ||period|| But soft ||exclamation_mark|| how many months
Do you desire ||question_mark|| 
Rest you fair ||comma|| good signior ||semicolon|| 
Your worship was the last man in our mouths ||period|| 
Shylock ||comma|| although I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess ||comma|| 
Yet ||comma|| to supply the ripe wants of my friend ||comma||

How much ye would ||question_mark||

Well then ||comma|| your bond ||semicolon|| and let me see ||semicolon|| but hear you ||semicolon|| 
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
Upon advantage ||period||

As his wise mother wrought in his behalf ||comma|| 
The third possessor ||semicolon|| ay ||comma|| he was the third ||dash|| 
And what of him ||question_mark|| did he take interest ||question_mark|| 
No ||comma|| not take interest ||comma|| not ||comma|| as you would say ||comma|| 
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did ||period|| 
When Laban and himself were compromised
That all the eanlings which were streak ||single_quote|| d and pied
Should fall as Jacob ||single_quote|| s hire ||comma|| the ewes ||comma|| being rank ||comma|| 
In the end of autumn turned to the rams ||comma||

The skilful shepherd peel ||single_quote|| d me certain wands ||comma|| 
And ||comma|| in the doing of the deed of kind ||comma|| 
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes ||comma|| 
Who then conceiving did in eaning time
Fall parti-colour ||single_quote|| d lambs ||comma|| and those were Jacob ||single_quote|| s ||period|| 
This was a way to thrive ||comma|| and he was blest:
And thrift is blessing ||comma|| if men steal it not ||period|| 
This was a venture ||comma|| sir ||comma|| that Jacob served for ||semicolon|| 
A thing not in his power to bring to pass ||comma|| 
But sway ||single_quote|| d and fashion ||single_quote|| d by the hand of heaven ||period|| 
Was this inserted to make interest good ||question_mark|| 
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams ||question_mark||

But note me ||comma|| signior ||period|| 
Mark you this ||comma|| Bassanio ||comma||

For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe ||period|| 
You call me misbeliever ||comma|| cut-throat dog ||comma||

I am as like to call thee so again ||comma|| 
To spit on thee again ||comma|| to spurn thee too ||period|| 
If thou wilt lend this money ||comma|| lend it not

Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
Commits itself to yours to be directed ||comma||

Myself and what is mine to you and yours

How much I was a braggart ||period|| When I told you
My state was nothing ||comma|| I should then have told you

A creature ||comma|| that did bear the shape of man ||comma|| 
So keen and greedy to confound a man:
He plies the duke at morning and at night ||comma|| 
And doth impeach the freedom of the state ||comma|| 
If they deny him justice: twenty merchants ||comma|| 
The duke himself ||comma|| and the magnificoes
Of greatest port ||comma|| have all persuaded with him ||semicolon|| 
But none can drive him from the envious plea
Of forfeiture ||comma|| of justice and his bond ||period|| 
When I was with him I have heard him swear
To Tubal and to Chus ||comma|| his countrymen ||comma||

I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond ||period|| 
Thou call ||single_quote|| dst me dog before thou hadst a cause ||semicolon|| 
But ||comma|| since I am a dog ||comma|| beware my fangs:
The duke shall grant me justice ||period|| I do wonder ||comma|| 
Thou naughty gaoler ||comma|| that thou art so fond

I pray thee ||comma|| hear me speak ||period|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll have my bond ||semicolon|| I will not hear thee speak:

Many that have at times made moan to me ||semicolon|| 
Therefore he hates me ||period|| 
I am sure the duke
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold ||period|| 
The duke cannot deny the course of law:
For the commodity that strangers have
With us in Venice ||comma|| if it be denied ||comma|| 
Will much impeach the justice of his state ||semicolon|| 
Since that the trade and profit of the city
Consisteth of all nations ||period|| Therefore ||comma|| go:

But if you knew to whom you show this honour ||comma|| 
How true a gentleman you send relief ||comma|| 
How dear a lover of my lord your husband ||comma||

Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love ||comma|| 
There must be needs a like proportion
Of lineaments ||comma|| of manners and of spirit ||semicolon|| 
Which makes me think that this Antonio ||comma|| 
Being the bosom lover of my lord ||comma|| 
Must needs be like my lord ||period|| If it be so ||comma|| 
How little is the cost I have bestow ||single_quote|| d

With a reed voice ||comma|| and turn two mincing steps
Into a manly stride ||comma|| and speak of frays
Like a fine bragging youth ||comma|| and tell quaint lies ||comma|| 
How honourable ladies sought my love ||comma|| 
Which I denying ||comma|| they fell sick and died ||semicolon||

And what hope is that ||comma|| I pray thee ||question_mark|| 
Marry ||comma|| you may partly hope that your father got you

This letter from Bellario doth commend
A young and learned doctor to our court ||period||

CLERK
Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
your messenger came ||comma|| in loving visitation was with
me a young doctor of Rome ||semicolon|| his name is Balthasar ||period|| I
acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o ||single_quote|| er
many books together: he is furnished with my
opinion ||semicolon|| which ||comma|| bettered with his own learning ||comma|| the
greatness whereof I cannot enough commend ||comma|| comes
with him ||comma|| at my importunity ||comma|| to fill up your grace ||single_quote|| s
request in my stead ||period|| I beseech you ||comma|| let his lack of
years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
estimation ||semicolon|| for I never knew so young a body with so
old a head ||period|| I leave him to your gracious
acceptance ||comma|| whose trial shall better publish his
commendation ||period|| 
You hear the learn ||single_quote|| d Bellario ||comma|| what he writes:
And here ||comma|| I take it ||comma|| is the doctor come ||period|| 
Give me your hand ||period|| Come you from old Bellario ||question_mark|| 
I did ||comma|| my lord ||period|| 
You are welcome: take your place ||period|| 
Are you acquainted with the difference
That holds this present question in the court ||question_mark|| 
I am informed thoroughly of the cause ||period|| 
Which is the merchant here ||comma|| and which the Jew ||question_mark|| 
Antonio and old Shylock ||comma|| both stand forth ||period|| 
Is your name Shylock ||question_mark|| 
Shylock is my name ||period|| 
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow ||semicolon|| 
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed ||period|| 
You stand within his danger ||comma|| do you not ||question_mark|| 
Ay ||comma|| so he says ||period|| 
Do you confess the bond ||question_mark|| 
I do ||period|| 
Then must the Jew be merciful ||period|| 
On what compulsion must I ||question_mark|| tell me that ||period|| 
The quality of mercy is not strain ||single_quote|| d ||comma|| 
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest ||semicolon|| 
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
 ||single_quote|| Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown ||semicolon|| 
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power ||comma|| 
The attribute to awe and majesty ||comma|| 
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings ||semicolon|| 
But mercy is above this sceptred sway ||semicolon|| 
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings ||comma|| 
It is an attribute to God himself ||semicolon|| 
And earthly power doth then show likest God ||single_quote|| s
When mercy seasons justice ||period|| Therefore ||comma|| Jew ||comma|| 
Though justice be thy plea ||comma|| consider this ||comma|| 
That ||comma|| in the course of justice ||comma|| none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy ||semicolon|| 
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy ||period|| I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea ||semicolon|| 
Which if thou follow ||comma|| this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence ||single_quote|| gainst the merchant there ||period|| 
My deeds upon my head ||exclamation_mark|| I crave the law ||comma|| 
The penalty and forfeit of my bond ||period|| 
Is he not able to discharge the money ||question_mark|| 
Yes ||comma|| here I tender it for him in the court ||semicolon|| 
Yea ||comma|| twice the sum: if that will not suffice ||comma|| 
I will be bound to pay it ten times o ||single_quote|| er ||comma|| 
On forfeit of my hands ||comma|| my head ||comma|| my heart:
If this will not suffice ||comma|| it must appear
That malice bears down truth ||period|| And I beseech you ||comma|| 
Wrest once the law to your authority:
To do a great right ||comma|| do a little wrong ||comma|| 
And curb this cruel devil of his will ||period|| 
It must not be ||semicolon|| there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established:
 ||single_quote|| Twill be recorded for a precedent ||comma|| 
And many an error by the same example
Will rush into the state: it cannot be ||period||

Shall I lay perjury upon my soul ||question_mark|| 
No ||comma|| not for Venice ||period|| 
Why ||comma|| this bond is forfeit ||semicolon|| 
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh ||comma|| to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant ||single_quote|| s heart ||period|| Be merciful:
Take thrice thy money ||semicolon|| bid me tear the bond ||period|| 
When it is paid according to the tenor ||period|| 
It doth appear you are a worthy judge ||semicolon|| 
You know the law ||comma|| your exposition
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law ||comma|| 
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar ||comma|| 
Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me: I stay here on my bond ||period|| 
Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgment ||period|| 
Why then ||comma|| thus it is:
You must prepare your bosom for his knife ||period|| 
O noble judge ||exclamation_mark|| O excellent young man ||exclamation_mark|| 
For the intent and purpose of the law
Hath full relation to the penalty ||comma|| 
Which here appeareth due upon the bond ||period|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis very true: O wise and upright judge ||exclamation_mark|| 
How much more elder art thou than thy looks ||exclamation_mark|| 
Therefore lay bare your bosom ||period|| 
Ay ||comma|| his breast:
So says the bond: doth it not ||comma|| noble judge ||question_mark||

I cannot find it ||semicolon|| ||single_quote|| tis not in the bond ||period||

But little: I am arm ||single_quote|| d and well prepared ||period|| 
Give me your hand ||comma|| Bassanio: fare you well ||exclamation_mark|| 
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you ||semicolon|| 
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom: it is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth ||comma|| 
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of poverty ||semicolon|| from which lingering penance
Of such misery doth she cut me off ||period|| 
Commend me to your honourable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio ||single_quote|| s end ||semicolon|| 
Say how I loved you ||comma|| speak me fair in death ||semicolon|| 
And ||comma|| when the tale is told ||comma|| bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love ||period|| 
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend ||comma|| 
And he repents not that he pays your debt ||semicolon|| 
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough ||comma|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll pay it presently with all my heart ||period|| 
Antonio ||comma|| I am married to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life itself ||semicolon|| 
But life itself ||comma|| my wife ||comma|| and all the world ||comma|| 
Are not with me esteem ||single_quote|| d above thy life:

Here to this devil ||comma|| to deliver you ||period|| 
Your wife would give you little thanks for that ||comma|| 
If she were by ||comma|| to hear you make the offer ||period||

The wish would make else an unquiet house ||period|| 
These be the Christian husbands ||period|| I have a daughter ||semicolon|| 
Would any of the stock of Barrabas

When neither is attended ||comma|| and I think
The nightingale ||comma|| if she should sing by day ||comma|| 
When every goose is cackling ||comma|| would be thought
No better a musician than the wren ||period|| 
How many things by season season ||single_quote|| d are
To their right praise and true perfection ||exclamation_mark|| 
Peace ||comma|| ho ||exclamation_mark|| the moon sleeps with Endymion
And would not be awaked ||period|| 
That is the voice ||comma|| 
Or I am much deceived ||comma|| of Portia ||period|| 
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo ||comma|| 
By the bad voice ||period|| 
Dear lady ||comma|| welcome home ||period|| 
We have been praying for our husbands ||single_quote|| healths ||comma||

But there is come a messenger before ||comma|| 
To signify their coming ||period|| 
Go in ||comma|| Nerissa ||semicolon|| 
Give order to my servants that they take
No note at all of our being absent hence ||semicolon|| 
Nor you ||comma|| Lorenzo ||semicolon|| Jessica ||comma|| nor you ||period|| 
Your husband is at hand ||semicolon|| I hear his trumpet:
We are no tell-tales ||comma|| madam ||semicolon|| fear you not ||period|| 
This night methinks is but the daylight sick ||semicolon|| 
It looks a little paler: ||single_quote|| tis a day ||comma|| 
Such as the day is when the sun is hid ||period|| 
We should hold day with the Antipodes ||comma|| 
If you would walk in absence of the sun ||period|| 
Let me give light ||comma|| but let me not be light ||semicolon|| 
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband ||comma|| 
And never be Bassanio so for me:
But God sort all ||exclamation_mark|| You are welcome home ||comma|| my lord ||period|| 
I thank you ||comma|| madam ||period|| Give welcome to my friend ||period|| 
This is the man ||comma|| this is Antonio ||comma|| 
To whom I am so infinitely bound ||period|| 
You should in all sense be much bound to him ||period|| 
For ||comma|| as I hear ||comma|| he was much bound for you ||period|| 
No more than I am well acquitted of ||period|| 
Sir ||comma|| you are very welcome to our house:
It must appear in other ways than words ||comma|| 
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy ||period|| 
[To FEMALE] By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong ||semicolon|| 
In faith ||comma|| I gave it to the judge ||single_quote|| s clerk:
Would he were gelt that had it ||comma|| for my part ||comma|| 
Since you do take it ||comma|| love ||comma|| so much at heart ||period|| 
A quarrel ||comma|| ho ||comma|| already ||exclamation_mark|| what ||single_quote|| s the matter ||question_mark|| 
About a hoop of gold ||comma|| a paltry ring
That she did give me ||comma|| whose posy was
For all the world like cutler ||single_quote|| s poetry
Upon a knife ||comma|| ||single_quote|| Love me ||comma|| and leave me not ||period|| ||single_quote|| 
What talk you of the posy or the value ||question_mark|| 
You swore to me ||comma|| when I did give it you ||comma|| 
That you would wear it till your hour of death
And that it should lie with you in your grave:
Though not for me ||comma|| yet for your vehement oaths ||comma|| 
You should have been respective and have kept it ||period|| 
Gave it a judge ||single_quote|| s clerk ||exclamation_mark|| no ||comma|| God ||single_quote|| s my judge ||comma|| 
The clerk will ne ||single_quote|| er wear hair on ||single_quote|| s face that had it ||period|| 
He will ||comma|| an if he live to be a man ||period|| 
Ay ||comma|| if a woman live to be a man ||period|| 
Now ||comma|| by this hand ||comma|| I gave it to a youth ||comma|| 
A kind of boy ||comma|| a little scrubbed boy ||comma|| 
No higher than thyself ||semicolon|| the judge ||single_quote|| s clerk ||comma|| 
A prating boy ||comma|| that begg ||single_quote|| d it as a fee:
I could not for my heart deny it him ||period|| 
You were to blame ||comma|| I must be plain with you ||comma|| 
To part so slightly with your wife ||single_quote|| s first gift:
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh ||period|| 
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Never to part with it ||semicolon|| and here he stands ||semicolon|| 
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
Nor pluck it from his finger ||comma|| for the wealth
That the world masters ||period|| Now ||comma|| in faith ||comma|| Gratiano ||comma|| 
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
An ||single_quote|| twere to me ||comma|| I should be mad at it ||period|| 
[Aside] Why ||comma|| I were best to cut my left hand off
And swear I lost the ring defending it ||period|| 
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
Unto the judge that begg ||single_quote|| d it and indeed
Deserved it too ||semicolon|| and then the boy ||comma|| his clerk ||comma|| 
That took some pains in writing ||comma|| he begg ||single_quote|| d mine ||semicolon|| 
And neither man nor master would take aught
But the two rings ||period|| 
What ring gave you my lord ||question_mark|| 
Not that ||comma|| I hope ||comma|| which you received of me ||period|| 
If I could add a lie unto a fault ||comma|| 
I would deny it ||semicolon|| but you see my finger
Hath not the ring upon it ||semicolon|| it is gone ||period|| 
Even so void is your false heart of truth ||period|| 
By heaven ||comma|| I will ne ||single_quote|| er come in your bed
Until I see the ring ||period|| 
Nor I in yours
Till I again see mine ||period|| 
Sweet Portia ||comma|| 
If you did know to whom I gave the ring ||comma|| 
If you did know for whom I gave the ring
And would conceive for what I gave the ring
And how unwillingly I left the ring ||comma|| 
When nought would be accepted but the ring ||comma|| 
You would abate the strength of your displeasure ||period|| 
If you had known the virtue of the ring ||comma|| 
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring ||comma|| 
Or your own honour to contain the ring ||comma|| 
You would not then have parted with the ring ||period|| 
What man is there so much unreasonable ||comma|| 
If you had pleased to have defended it
With any terms of zeal ||comma|| wanted the modesty
To urge the thing held as a ceremony ||question_mark|| 
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
I ||single_quote|| ll die for ||single_quote|| t but some woman had the ring ||period|| 
No ||comma|| by my honour ||comma|| madam ||comma|| by my soul ||comma|| 
No woman had it ||comma|| but a civil doctor ||comma|| 
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
And begg ||single_quote|| d the ring ||semicolon|| the which I did deny him
And suffer ||single_quote|| d him to go displeased away ||semicolon|| 
Even he that did uphold the very life
Of my dear friend ||period|| What should I say ||comma|| sweet lady ||question_mark|| 
I was enforced to send it after him ||semicolon|| 
I was beset with shame and courtesy ||semicolon|| 
My honour would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it ||period|| Pardon me ||comma|| good lady ||semicolon|| 
For ||comma|| by these blessed candles of the night ||comma|| 
Had you been there ||comma|| I think you would have begg ||single_quote|| d
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor ||period|| 
Let not that doctor e ||single_quote|| er come near my house:
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved ||comma|| 
And that which you did swear to keep for me ||comma|| 
I will become as liberal as you ||semicolon|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll not deny him any thing I have ||comma|| 
No ||comma|| not my body nor my husband ||single_quote|| s bed:
Know him I shall ||comma|| I am well sure of it:
Lie not a night from home ||semicolon|| watch me like Argus:
If you do not ||comma|| if I be left alone ||comma|| 
Now ||comma|| by mine honour ||comma|| which is yet mine own ||comma|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll have that doctor for my bedfellow ||period|| 
And I his clerk ||semicolon|| therefore be well advised
How you do leave me to mine own protection ||period|| 
Well ||comma|| do you so ||semicolon|| let not me take him ||comma|| then ||semicolon|| 
For if I do ||comma|| I ||single_quote|| ll mar the young clerk ||single_quote|| s pen ||period|| 
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels ||period|| 
Sir ||comma|| grieve not you ||semicolon|| you are welcome notwithstanding ||period|| 
Portia ||comma|| forgive me this enforced wrong ||semicolon|| 
And ||comma|| in the hearing of these many friends ||comma|| 
I swear to thee ||comma|| even by thine own fair eyes ||comma|| 
Wherein I see myself ||dash|| 
Mark you but that ||exclamation_mark|| 
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself ||semicolon|| 
In each eye ||comma|| one: swear by your double self ||comma|| 
And there ||single_quote|| s an oath of credit ||period|| 
Nay ||comma|| but hear me:
Pardon this fault ||comma|| and by my soul I swear
I never more will break an oath with thee ||period|| 
I once did lend my body for his wealth ||semicolon|| 
Which ||comma|| but for him that had your husband ||single_quote|| s ring ||comma|| 
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again ||comma|| 
My soul upon the forfeit ||comma|| that your lord
Will never more break faith advisedly ||period|| 
Then you shall be his surety ||period|| Give him this
And bid him keep it better than the other ||period|| 
Here ||comma|| Lord Bassanio ||semicolon|| swear to keep this ring ||period|| 
By heaven ||comma|| it is the same I gave the doctor ||exclamation_mark|| 
I had it of him: pardon me ||comma|| Bassanio ||semicolon|| 
For ||comma|| by this ring ||comma|| the doctor lay with me ||period|| 
And pardon me ||comma|| my gentle Gratiano ||semicolon|| 
For that same scrubbed boy ||comma|| the doctor ||single_quote|| s clerk ||comma|| 
In lieu of this last night did lie with me ||period|| 
Why ||comma|| this is like the mending of highways
In summer ||comma|| where the ways are fair enough:
What ||comma|| are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it ||question_mark|| 
Speak not so grossly ||period|| You are all amazed:
Here is a letter ||semicolon|| read it at your leisure ||semicolon||

I chanced on this letter ||period|| 
I am dumb ||period|| 
Were you the doctor and I knew you not ||question_mark|| 
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold ||question_mark|| 
Ay ||comma|| but the clerk that never means to do it ||comma|| 
Unless he live until he be a man ||period|| 
Sweet doctor ||comma|| you shall be my bed-fellow:
When I am absent ||comma|| then lie with my wife ||period|| 
Sweet lady ||comma|| you have given me life and living ||semicolon|| 
For here I read for certain that my ships
Are safely come to road ||period|| 
How now ||comma|| Lorenzo ||exclamation_mark||

Ay ||comma|| and I ||single_quote|| ll give them him without a fee ||period|| 
There do I give to you and Jessica ||comma||

Of these events at full ||period|| Let us go in ||semicolon||

Let it be so: the first inter ||single_quote|| gatory

But were the day come ||comma|| I should wish it dark ||comma||

Well ||comma|| while I live I ||single_quote|| ll fear no other thing
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa ||single_quote|| s ring ||period||

That thou ||comma|| Iago ||comma|| who hast had my purse

But he ||semicolon|| as loving his own pride and purposes ||comma|| 
Evades them ||comma|| with a bombast circumstance
Horribly stuff ||single_quote|| d with epithets of war ||semicolon||

So opposite to marriage that she shunned
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation ||comma||

FIRST SENATOR
This cannot be ||comma||

The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk ||comma||

So may he with more facile question bear it ||comma|| 
For that it stands not in such warlike brace ||comma||

The very head and front of my offending

For since these arms of mine had seven years ||single_quote|| pith ||comma|| 
Till now some nine moons wasted ||comma|| they have used
Their dearest action in the tented field ||comma|| 
And little of this great world can I speak ||comma|| 
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle ||comma|| 
And therefore little shall I grace my cause
In speaking for myself ||period|| Yet ||comma|| by your gracious patience ||comma|| 
I will a round unvarnish ||single_quote|| d tale deliver

Why this should be ||period|| I therefore vouch again
That with some mixtures powerful o ||single_quote|| er the blood ||comma||

Or came it by request and such fair question

I do beseech you ||comma|| 
Send for the lady to the Sagittary ||comma|| 
And let her speak of me before her father:
If you do find me foul in her report ||comma||

From year to year ||comma|| the battles ||comma|| sieges ||comma|| fortunes ||comma|| 
That I have passed ||period|| 
I ran it through ||comma|| even from my boyish days ||comma||

Of moving accidents by flood and field
Of hair-breadth scapes i ||single_quote|| the imminent deadly breach ||comma|| 
Of being taken by the insolent foe
And sold to slavery ||comma|| of my redemption thence

Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle ||comma|| 
Rough quarries ||comma|| rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
It was my hint to speak ||comma|| ||dash|| such was the process ||semicolon|| 
And of the Cannibals that each other eat ||comma|| 
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
Do grow beneath their shoulders ||period|| This to hear
Would Desdemona seriously incline:
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch ||comma|| 
She ||single_quote|| ld come again ||comma|| and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse: which I observing ||comma|| 
Took once a pliant hour ||comma|| and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate ||comma|| 
Whereof by parcels she had something heard ||comma|| 
But not intentively: I did consent ||comma|| 
And often did beguile her of her tears ||comma|| 
When I did speak of some distressful stroke

She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
She swore ||comma|| in faith ||comma|| twas strange ||comma|| ||single_quote|| twas passing strange ||comma||

She wish ||single_quote|| d she had not heard it ||comma|| yet she wish ||single_quote|| d
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank ||single_quote|| d me ||comma|| 
And bade me ||comma|| if I had a friend that loved her ||comma|| 
I should but teach him how to tell my story ||period|| 
And that would woo her ||period|| Upon this hint I spake:
She loved me for the dangers I had pass ||single_quote|| d ||comma|| 
And I loved her that she did pity them ||period|| 
This only is the witchcraft I have used:
Here comes the lady ||semicolon|| let her witness it ||period|| 
I think this tale would win my daughter too ||period|| 
Good Brabantio ||comma|| 
Take up this mangled matter at the best:
Men do their broken weapons rather use

Do you perceive in all this noble company
Where most you owe obedience ||question_mark||

Is the next way to draw new mischief on ||period|| 
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
Patience her injury a mockery makes ||period|| 
The robb ||single_quote|| d that smiles steals something from the thief ||semicolon|| 
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief ||period|| 
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile ||semicolon|| 
We lose it not ||comma|| so long as we can smile ||period|| 
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
But the free comfort which from thence he hears ||comma||

I humbly beseech you ||comma|| proceed to the affairs of state ||period|| 
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
Cyprus ||period|| Othello ||comma|| the fortitude of the place is best

slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this

Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise
A natural and prompt alacrity

These present wars against the Ottomites ||period|| 
Most humbly therefore bending to your state ||comma||

Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate ||period|| 
So that ||comma|| dear lords ||comma|| if I be left behind ||comma||

Vouch with me ||comma|| heaven ||comma|| I therefore beg it not ||comma|| 
To please the palate of my appetite ||comma||

In me defunct ||dash|| and proper satisfaction ||period|| 
But to be free and bounteous to her mind:
And heaven defend your good souls ||comma|| that you think

Speak ||comma|| who began this ||question_mark|| on thy love ||comma|| I charge thee ||period|| 
I do not know: friends all but now ||comma|| even now ||comma|| 
In quarter ||comma|| and in terms like bride and groom
Devesting them for bed ||semicolon|| and then ||comma|| but now ||dash|| 
As if some planet had unwitted men ||dash|| 
Swords out ||comma|| and tilting one at other ||single_quote|| s breast ||comma|| 
In opposition bloody ||period|| I cannot speak
Any beginning to this peevish odds ||semicolon|| 
And would in action glorious I had lost
Those legs that brought me to a part of it ||exclamation_mark|| 
How comes it ||comma|| Michael ||comma|| you are thus forgot ||question_mark|| 
I pray you ||comma|| pardon me ||semicolon|| I cannot speak ||period|| 
Worthy Montano ||comma|| you were wont be civil ||semicolon|| 
The gravity and stillness of your youth
The world hath noted ||comma|| and your name is great
In mouths of wisest censure: what ||single_quote|| s the matter ||comma|| 
That you unlace your reputation thus
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a night-brawler ||question_mark|| give me answer to it ||period|| 
Worthy Othello ||comma|| I am hurt to danger:
Your officer ||comma|| Iago ||comma|| can inform you ||comma|| ||dash|| 
While I spare speech ||comma|| which something now
offends me ||comma|| ||dash|| 
Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
By me that ||single_quote|| s said or done amiss this night ||semicolon|| 
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice ||comma|| 
And to defend ourselves it be a sin
When violence assails us ||period|| 
Now ||comma|| by heaven ||comma|| 
My blood begins my safer guides to rule ||semicolon|| 
And passion ||comma|| having my best judgment collied ||comma|| 
Assays to lead the way: if I once stir ||comma|| 
Or do but lift this arm ||comma|| the best of you
Shall sink in my rebuke ||period|| Give me to know
How this foul rout began ||comma|| who set it on ||semicolon|| 
And he that is approved in this offence ||comma|| 
Though he had twinn ||single_quote|| d with me ||comma|| both at a birth ||comma|| 
Shall lose me ||period|| What ||exclamation_mark|| in a town of war ||comma|| 
Yet wild ||comma|| the people ||single_quote|| s hearts brimful of fear ||comma|| 
To manage private and domestic quarrel ||comma|| 
In night ||comma|| and on the court and guard of safety ||exclamation_mark|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis monstrous ||period|| Iago ||comma|| who began ||single_quote|| t ||question_mark|| 
If partially affined ||comma|| or leagued in office ||comma|| 
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth ||comma|| 
Thou art no soldier ||period|| 
Touch me not so near:
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio ||semicolon|| 
Yet ||comma|| I persuade myself ||comma|| to speak the truth
Shall nothing wrong him ||period|| Thus it is ||comma|| general ||period|| 
Montano and myself being in speech ||comma|| 
There comes a fellow crying out for help:
And Cassio following him with determined sword ||comma|| 
To execute upon him ||period|| Sir ||comma|| this gentleman
Steps in to Cassio ||comma|| and entreats his pause:
Myself the crying fellow did pursue ||comma|| 
Lest by his clamour ||dash|| as it so fell out ||dash|| 
The town might fall in fright: he ||comma|| swift of foot ||comma|| 
Outran my purpose ||semicolon|| and I return ||single_quote|| d the rather
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords ||comma|| 
And Cassio high in oath ||semicolon|| which till to-night
I ne ||single_quote|| er might say before ||period|| When I came back ||dash|| 
For this was brief ||dash|| I found them close together ||comma|| 
At blow and thrust ||semicolon|| even as again they were
When you yourself did part them ||period|| 
More of this matter cannot I report:
But men are men ||semicolon|| the best sometimes forget:
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him ||comma|| 
As men in rage strike those that wish them best ||comma|| 
Yet surely Cassio ||comma|| I believe ||comma|| received
From him that fled some strange indignity ||comma|| 
Which patience could not pass ||period|| 
I know ||comma|| Iago ||comma|| 
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter ||comma|| 
Making it light to Cassio ||period|| Cassio ||comma|| I love thee
But never more be officer of mine ||period|| 
Look ||comma|| if my gentle love be not raised up ||exclamation_mark|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll make thee an example ||period|| 
What ||single_quote|| s the matter ||question_mark|| 
All ||single_quote|| s well now ||comma|| sweeting ||semicolon|| come away to bed ||period|| 
Sir ||comma|| for your hurts ||comma|| myself will be your surgeon:
Lead him off ||period|| 
Iago ||comma|| look with care about the town ||comma|| 
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted ||period|| 
Come ||comma|| Desdemona: ||single_quote|| tis the soldiers ||single_quote|| life

What ||comma|| are you hurt ||comma|| lieutenant ||question_mark|| 
Ay ||comma|| past all surgery ||period|| 
Marry ||comma|| heaven forbid ||exclamation_mark|| 
Reputation ||comma|| reputation ||comma|| reputation ||exclamation_mark|| O ||comma|| I have lost
my reputation ||exclamation_mark|| I have lost the immortal part of
myself ||comma|| and what remains is bestial ||period|| My reputation ||comma|| 
Iago ||comma|| my reputation ||exclamation_mark|| 
As I am an honest man ||comma|| I thought you had received
some bodily wound ||semicolon|| there is more sense in that than
in reputation ||period|| Reputation is an idle and most false
imposition: oft got without merit ||comma|| and lost without
deserving: you have lost no reputation at all ||comma|| 
unless you repute yourself such a loser ||period|| What ||comma|| man ||exclamation_mark|| 
there are ways to recover the general again: you
are but now cast in his mood ||comma|| a punishment more in
policy than in malice ||comma|| even so as one would beat his
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
to him again ||comma|| and he ||single_quote|| s yours ||period|| 
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
good a commander with so slight ||comma|| so drunken ||comma|| and so
indiscreet an officer ||period|| Drunk ||question_mark|| and speak parrot ||question_mark|| 
and squabble ||question_mark|| swagger ||question_mark|| swear ||question_mark|| and discourse
fustian with one ||single_quote|| s own shadow ||question_mark|| O thou invisible
spirit of wine ||comma|| if thou hast no name to be known by ||comma|| 
let us call thee devil ||exclamation_mark|| 
What was he that you followed with your sword ||question_mark|| What
had he done to you ||question_mark|| 
I know not ||period|| 
Is ||single_quote|| t possible ||question_mark|| 
I remember a mass of things ||comma|| but nothing distinctly ||semicolon|| 
a quarrel ||comma|| but nothing wherefore ||period|| O God ||comma|| that men
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
their brains ||exclamation_mark|| that we should ||comma|| with joy ||comma|| pleasance
revel and applause ||comma|| transform ourselves into beasts ||exclamation_mark|| 
Why ||comma|| but you are now well enough: how came you thus
recovered ||question_mark|| 
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
to the devil wrath ||semicolon|| one unperfectness shows me
another ||comma|| to make me frankly despise myself ||period|| 
Come ||comma|| you are too severe a moraler: as the time ||comma|| 
the place ||comma|| and the condition of this country
stands ||comma|| I could heartily wish this had not befallen ||semicolon|| 
but ||comma|| since it is as it is ||comma|| mend it for your own good ||period|| 
I will ask him for my place again ||semicolon|| he shall tell me
I am a drunkard ||exclamation_mark|| Had I as many mouths as Hydra ||comma|| 
such an answer would stop them all ||period|| To be now a
sensible man ||comma|| by and by a fool ||comma|| and presently a
beast ||exclamation_mark|| O strange ||exclamation_mark|| Every inordinate cup is
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil ||period|| 
Come ||comma|| come ||comma|| good wine is a good familiar creature ||comma|| 
if it be well used: exclaim no more against it ||period|| 
And ||comma|| good lieutenant ||comma|| I think you think I love you ||period|| 
I have well approved it ||comma|| sir ||period|| I drunk ||exclamation_mark|| 
You or any man living may be drunk ||exclamation_mark|| at a time ||comma|| man ||period|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll tell you what you shall do ||period|| Our general ||single_quote|| s wife
is now the general: may say so in this respect ||comma|| for
that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
contemplation ||comma|| mark ||comma|| and denotement of her parts and
graces: confess yourself freely to her ||semicolon|| importune
her help to put you in your place again: she is of
so free ||comma|| so kind ||comma|| so apt ||comma|| so blessed a disposition ||comma|| 
she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
than she is requested: this broken joint between
you and her husband entreat her to splinter ||semicolon|| and ||comma|| my
fortunes against any lay worth naming ||comma|| this
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before ||period|| 
You advise me well ||period|| 
I protest ||comma|| in the sincerity of love and honest kindness ||period|| 
I think it freely ||semicolon|| and betimes in the morning I will
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here ||period|| 
You are in the right ||period|| Good night ||comma|| lieutenant ||semicolon|| I
must to the watch ||period|| 
Good night ||comma|| honest Iago ||period|| 
And what ||single_quote|| s he then that says I play the villain ||question_mark|| 
When this advice is free I give and honest ||comma|| 
Probal to thinking and indeed the course
To win the Moor again ||question_mark|| For ||single_quote|| tis most easy
The inclining Desdemona to subdue
In any honest suit: she ||single_quote|| s framed as fruitful
As the free elements ||period|| And then for her
To win the Moor ||dash|| were ||single_quote|| t to renounce his baptism ||comma|| 
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin ||comma|| 
His soul is so enfetter ||single_quote|| d to her love ||comma|| 
That she may make ||comma|| unmake ||comma|| do what she list ||comma|| 
Even as her appetite shall play the god
With his weak function ||period|| How am I then a villain
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course ||comma|| 
Directly to his good ||question_mark|| Divinity of hell ||exclamation_mark|| 
When devils will the blackest sins put on ||comma|| 
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows ||comma|| 
As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor ||comma|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll pour this pestilence into his ear ||comma|| 
That she repeals him for her body ||single_quote|| s lust ||semicolon|| 
And by how much she strives to do him good ||comma|| 
She shall undo her credit with the Moor ||period|| 
So will I turn her virtue into pitch ||comma|| 
And out of her own goodness make the net
That shall enmesh them all ||period|| 
How now ||comma|| Roderigo ||exclamation_mark|| 
I do follow here in the chase ||comma|| not like a hound that
hunts ||comma|| but one that fills up the cry ||period|| My money is
almost spent ||semicolon|| I have been to-night exceedingly well
cudgelled ||semicolon|| and I think the issue will be ||comma|| I shall
have so much experience for my pains ||comma|| and so ||comma|| with
no money at all and a little more wit ||comma|| return again to Venice ||period|| 
How poor are they that have not patience ||exclamation_mark|| 
What wound did ever heal but by degrees ||question_mark|| 
Thou know ||single_quote|| st we work by wit ||comma|| and not by witchcraft ||semicolon|| 
And wit depends on dilatory time ||period|| 
Does ||single_quote|| t not go well ||question_mark|| Cassio hath beaten thee ||period|| 
And thou ||comma|| by that small hurt ||comma|| hast cashier ||single_quote|| d Cassio:
Though other things grow fair against the sun ||comma|| 
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
Content thyself awhile ||period|| By the mass ||comma|| ||single_quote|| tis morning ||semicolon|| 
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short ||period|| 
Retire thee ||semicolon|| go where thou art billeted:
Away ||comma|| I say ||semicolon|| thou shalt know more hereafter:
Nay ||comma|| get thee gone ||period|| 
Two things are to be done:
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress ||semicolon|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll set her on ||semicolon|| 
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart ||comma|| 
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
Soliciting his wife: ay ||comma|| that ||single_quote|| s the way
Dull not device by coldness and delay ||period|| 
Masters ||comma|| play here ||semicolon|| I will content your pains ||semicolon|| 
Something that ||single_quote|| s brief ||semicolon|| and bid ||single_quote|| Good morrow ||comma|| general ||period|| ||single_quote|| 	
Why masters ||comma|| have your instruments been in Naples ||comma||

How ||comma|| sir ||comma|| how ||exclamation_mark|| 
Are these ||comma|| I pray you ||comma|| wind-instruments ||question_mark|| 
Ay ||comma|| marry ||comma|| are they ||comma|| sir ||period|| 
O ||comma|| thereby hangs a tail ||period|| 
Whereby hangs a tale ||comma|| sir ||question_mark|| 
Marry ||period|| sir ||comma|| by many a wind-instrument that I know ||period|| 
But ||comma|| masters ||comma|| here ||single_quote|| s money for you: and the general
so likes your music ||comma|| that he desires you ||comma|| for love ||single_quote|| s
sake ||comma|| to make no more noise with it ||period|| 
Well ||comma|| sir ||comma|| we will not ||period|| 
If you have any music that may not be heard ||comma|| to ||single_quote|| t
again: but ||comma|| as they say to hear music the general
does not greatly care ||period|| 
We have none such ||comma|| sir ||period|| 
Then put up your pipes in your bag ||comma|| for I ||single_quote|| ll away:
go ||semicolon|| vanish into air ||semicolon|| away ||exclamation_mark|| 
Dost thou hear ||comma|| my honest friend ||question_mark|| 
No ||comma|| I hear not your honest friend ||semicolon|| I hear you ||period|| 
Prithee ||comma|| keep up thy quillets ||period|| There ||single_quote|| s a poor piece
of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends
the general ||single_quote|| s wife be stirring ||comma|| tell her there ||single_quote|| s
one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:
wilt thou do this ||question_mark|| 
She is stirring ||comma|| sir: if she will stir hither ||comma|| I
shall seem to notify unto her ||period|| 
Do ||comma|| good my friend ||period|| 
In happy time ||comma|| Iago ||period|| 
You have not been a-bed ||comma|| then ||question_mark|| 
Why ||comma|| no ||semicolon|| the day had broke
Before we parted ||period|| I have made bold ||comma|| Iago ||comma|| 
To send in to your wife: my suit to her
Is ||comma|| that she will to virtuous Desdemona
Procure me some access ||period|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll send her to you presently ||semicolon|| 
And I ||single_quote|| ll devise a mean to draw the Moor
Out of the way ||comma|| that your converse and business
May be more free ||period|| 
I humbly thank you for ||single_quote|| t ||period|| 
I never knew
A Florentine more kind and honest ||period|| 
Good morrow ||comma|| good Lieutenant: I am sorry
For your displeasure ||semicolon|| but all will sure be well ||period|| 
The general and his wife are talking of it ||semicolon|| 
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies ||comma|| 
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus ||comma|| 
And great affinity ||comma|| and that in wholesome wisdom
He might not but refuse you ||semicolon|| but he protests he loves you
And needs no other suitor but his likings
To take the safest occasion by the front
To bring you in again ||period|| 
Yet ||comma|| I beseech you ||comma|| 
If you think fit ||comma|| or that it may be done ||comma|| 
Give me advantage of some brief discourse
With Desdemona alone ||period|| 
Pray you ||comma|| come in ||semicolon|| 
I will bestow you where you shall have time
To speak your bosom freely ||period|| 
I am much bound to you ||period|| 
These letters give ||comma|| Iago ||comma|| to the pilot ||semicolon|| 
And by him do my duties to the senate:
That done ||comma|| I will be walking on the works ||semicolon|| 
Repair there to me ||period|| 
Well ||comma|| my good lord ||comma|| I ||single_quote|| ll do ||single_quote|| t ||period|| 
This fortification ||comma|| gentlemen ||comma|| shall we see ||single_quote|| t ||question_mark|| 
GENTLEMAN
We ||single_quote|| ll wait upon your lordship ||period|| 
Be thou assured ||comma|| good Cassio ||comma|| I will do
All my abilities in thy behalf ||period|| 
Good madam ||comma|| do: I warrant it grieves my husband ||comma|| 
As if the case were his ||period|| 
O ||comma|| that ||single_quote|| s an honest fellow ||period|| Do not doubt ||comma|| Cassio ||comma|| 
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were ||period|| 
Bounteous madam ||comma|| 
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio ||comma|| 
He ||single_quote|| s never any thing but your true servant ||period|| 
I know ||single_quote|| t ||semicolon|| I thank you ||period|| You do love my lord:
You have known him long ||semicolon|| and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no further off
Than in a polite distance ||period|| 
Ay ||comma|| but ||comma|| lady ||comma|| 
That policy may either last so long ||comma|| 
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet ||comma|| 
Or breed itself so out of circumstance ||comma|| 
That ||comma|| I being absent and my place supplied ||comma|| 
My general will forget my love and service ||period|| 
Do not doubt that ||semicolon|| before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee ||comma|| 
If I do vow a friendship ||comma|| I ||single_quote|| ll perform it
To the last article: my lord shall never rest ||semicolon|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience ||semicolon|| 
His bed shall seem a school ||comma|| his board a shrift ||semicolon|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll intermingle every thing he does
With Cassio ||single_quote|| s suit: therefore be merry ||comma|| Cassio ||semicolon|| 
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away ||period|| 
Madam ||comma|| here comes my lord ||period|| 
Madam ||comma|| I ||single_quote|| ll take my leave ||period|| 
Why ||comma|| stay ||comma|| and hear me speak ||period|| 
Madam ||comma|| not now: I am very ill at ease ||comma|| 
Unfit for mine own purposes ||period|| 
Well ||comma|| do your discretion ||period|| 
Ha ||exclamation_mark|| I like not that ||period|| 
What dost thou say ||question_mark|| 
Nothing ||comma|| my lord: or if ||dash|| I know not what ||period|| 
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife ||question_mark|| 
Cassio ||comma|| my lord ||exclamation_mark|| No ||comma|| sure ||comma|| I cannot think it ||comma|| 
That he would steal away so guilty-like ||comma|| 
Seeing you coming ||period|| 
I do believe ||single_quote|| twas he ||period|| 
How now ||comma|| my lord ||exclamation_mark|| 
I have been talking with a suitor here ||comma|| 
A man that languishes in your displeasure ||period|| 
Who is ||single_quote|| t you mean ||question_mark|| 
Why ||comma|| your lieutenant ||comma|| Cassio ||period|| Good my lord ||comma|| 
If I have any grace or power to move you ||comma|| 
His present reconciliation take ||semicolon|| 
For if he be not one that truly loves you ||comma|| 
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning ||comma|| 
I have no judgment in an honest face:
I prithee ||comma|| call him back ||period|| 
Went he hence now ||question_mark|| 
Ay ||comma|| sooth ||semicolon|| so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me ||comma|| 
To suffer with him ||period|| Good love ||comma|| call him back ||period|| 
Not now ||comma|| sweet Desdemona ||semicolon|| some other time ||period|| 
But shall ||single_quote|| t be shortly ||question_mark|| 
The sooner ||comma|| sweet ||comma|| for you ||period|| 
Shall ||single_quote|| t be to-night at supper ||question_mark|| 
No ||comma|| not to-night ||period|| 
To-morrow dinner ||comma|| then ||question_mark|| 
I shall not dine at home ||semicolon|| 
I meet the captains at the citadel ||period|| 
Why ||comma|| then ||comma|| to-morrow night ||semicolon|| or Tuesday morn ||semicolon|| 
On Tuesday noon ||comma|| or night ||semicolon|| on Wednesday morn:
I prithee ||comma|| name the time ||comma|| but let it not
Exceed three days: in faith ||comma|| he ||single_quote|| s penitent ||semicolon|| 
And yet his trespass ||comma|| in our common reason ||dash|| 
Save that ||comma|| they say ||comma|| the wars must make examples
Out of their best ||dash|| is not almost a fault
To incur a private cheque ||period|| When shall he come ||question_mark|| 
Tell me ||comma|| Othello: I wonder in my soul ||comma|| 
What you would ask me ||comma|| that I should deny ||comma|| 
Or stand so mammering on ||period|| What ||exclamation_mark|| Michael Cassio ||comma|| 
That came a-wooing with you ||comma|| and so many a time ||comma|| 
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly ||comma|| 
Hath ta ||single_quote|| en your part ||semicolon|| to have so much to do
To bring him in ||exclamation_mark|| Trust me ||comma|| I could do much ||comma|| ||dash|| 
Prithee ||comma|| no more: let him come when he will ||semicolon|| 
I will deny thee nothing ||period|| 
Why ||comma|| this is not a boon ||semicolon|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves ||comma|| 
Or feed on nourishing dishes ||comma|| or keep you warm ||comma|| 
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person: nay ||comma|| when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed ||comma|| 
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
And fearful to be granted ||period|| 
I will deny thee nothing:
Whereon ||comma|| I do beseech thee ||comma|| grant me this ||comma|| 
To leave me but a little to myself ||period|| 
Shall I deny you ||question_mark|| no: farewell ||comma|| my lord ||period|| 
Farewell ||comma|| my Desdemona: I ||single_quote|| ll come to thee straight ||period|| 
Emilia ||comma|| come ||period|| Be as your fancies teach you ||semicolon|| 
Whate ||single_quote|| er you be ||comma|| I am obedient ||period|| 
Excellent wretch ||exclamation_mark|| Perdition catch my soul ||comma|| 
But I do love thee ||exclamation_mark|| and when I love thee not ||comma|| 
Chaos is come again ||period|| 
My noble lord ||dash|| 
What dost thou say ||comma|| Iago ||question_mark|| 
Did Michael Cassio ||comma|| when you woo ||single_quote|| d my lady ||comma|| 
Know of your love ||question_mark|| 
He did ||comma|| from first to last: why dost thou ask ||question_mark|| 
But for a satisfaction of my thought ||semicolon|| 
No further harm ||period|| 
Why of thy thought ||comma|| Iago ||question_mark|| 
I did not think he had been acquainted with her ||period|| 
O ||comma|| yes ||semicolon|| and went between us very oft ||period|| 
Indeed ||exclamation_mark|| 
Indeed ||exclamation_mark|| ay ||comma|| indeed: discern ||single_quote|| st thou aught in that ||question_mark|| 
Is he not honest ||question_mark|| 
Honest ||comma|| my lord ||exclamation_mark|| 
Honest ||exclamation_mark|| ay ||comma|| honest ||period|| 
My lord ||comma|| for aught I know ||period|| 
What dost thou think ||question_mark|| 
Think ||comma|| my lord ||exclamation_mark|| 
Think ||comma|| my lord ||exclamation_mark|| 
By heaven ||comma|| he echoes me ||comma|| 
As if there were some monster in his thought
Too hideous to be shown ||period|| Thou dost mean something:
I heard thee say even now ||comma|| thou likedst not that ||comma|| 
When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like ||question_mark|| 
And when I told thee he was of my counsel
In my whole course of wooing ||comma|| thou criedst ||single_quote|| Indeed ||exclamation_mark|| ||single_quote|| 
And didst contract and purse thy brow together ||comma|| 
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me ||comma|| 
Show me thy thought ||period|| 
My lord ||comma|| you know I love you ||period|| 
I think thou dost ||semicolon|| 
And ||comma|| for I know thou ||single_quote|| rt full of love and honesty ||comma|| 
And weigh ||single_quote|| st thy words before thou givest them breath ||comma|| 
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
For such things in a false disloyal knave
Are tricks of custom ||comma|| but in a man that ||single_quote|| s just
They are close delations ||comma|| working from the heart
That passion cannot rule ||period|| 
For Michael Cassio ||comma|| 
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest ||period|| 
I think so too ||period|| 
Men should be what they seem ||semicolon|| 
Or those that be not ||comma|| would they might seem none ||exclamation_mark|| 
Certain ||comma|| men should be what they seem ||period|| 
Why ||comma|| then ||comma|| I think Cassio ||single_quote|| s an honest man ||period|| 
Nay ||comma|| yet there ||single_quote|| s more in this:
I prithee ||comma|| speak to me as to thy thinkings ||comma|| 
As thou dost ruminate ||comma|| and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words ||period|| 
Good my lord ||comma|| pardon me:
Though I am bound to every act of duty ||comma|| 
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to ||period|| 
Utter my thoughts ||question_mark|| Why ||comma|| say they are vile and false ||semicolon|| 
As where ||single_quote|| s that palace whereinto foul things
Sometimes intrude not ||question_mark|| who has a breast so pure ||comma|| 
But some uncleanly apprehensions
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
With meditations lawful ||question_mark|| 
Thou dost conspire against thy friend ||comma|| Iago ||comma|| 
If thou but think ||single_quote|| st him wrong ||single_quote|| d and makest his ear
A stranger to thy thoughts ||period|| 
I do beseech you ||dash|| 
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess ||comma|| 
As ||comma|| I confess ||comma|| it is my nature ||single_quote|| s plague
To spy into abuses ||comma|| and oft my jealousy
Shapes faults that are not ||dash|| that your wisdom yet ||comma|| 
From one that so imperfectly conceits ||comma|| 
Would take no notice ||comma|| nor build yourself a trouble
Out of his scattering and unsure observance ||period|| 
It were not for your quiet nor your good ||comma|| 
Nor for my manhood ||comma|| honesty ||comma|| or wisdom ||comma|| 
To let you know my thoughts ||period|| 
What dost thou mean ||question_mark|| 
Good name in man and woman ||comma|| dear my lord ||comma|| 
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
Who steals my purse steals trash ||semicolon|| ||single_quote|| tis something ||comma|| nothing ||semicolon|| 
 ||single_quote|| Twas mine ||comma|| ||single_quote|| tis his ||comma|| and has been slave to thousands:
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed ||period|| 
By heaven ||comma|| I ||single_quote|| ll know thy thoughts ||period|| 
You cannot ||comma|| if my heart were in your hand ||semicolon|| 
Nor shall not ||comma|| whilst ||single_quote|| tis in my custody ||period|| 
Ha ||exclamation_mark|| 
O ||comma|| beware ||comma|| my lord ||comma|| of jealousy ||semicolon|| 
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on ||semicolon|| that cuckold lives in bliss
Who ||comma|| certain of his fate ||comma|| loves not his wronger ||semicolon|| 
But ||comma|| O ||comma|| what damned minutes tells he o ||single_quote|| er
Who dotes ||comma|| yet doubts ||comma|| suspects ||comma|| yet strongly loves ||exclamation_mark|| 
O misery ||exclamation_mark|| 
Poor and content is rich and rich enough ||comma|| 
But riches fineless is as poor as winter
To him that ever fears he shall be poor ||period|| 
Good heaven ||comma|| the souls of all my tribe defend
From jealousy ||exclamation_mark|| 
Why ||comma|| why is this ||question_mark|| 
Think ||single_quote|| st thou I ||single_quote|| ld make a lie of jealousy ||comma|| 
To follow still the changes of the moon
With fresh suspicions ||question_mark|| No ||semicolon|| to be once in doubt
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat ||comma|| 
When I shall turn the business of my soul
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises ||comma|| 
Matching thy inference ||period|| ||single_quote|| Tis not to make me jealous
To say my wife is fair ||comma|| feeds well ||comma|| loves company ||comma|| 
Is free of speech ||comma|| sings ||comma|| plays and dances well ||semicolon|| 
Where virtue is ||comma|| these are more virtuous:
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt ||semicolon|| 
For she had eyes ||comma|| and chose me ||period|| No ||comma|| Iago ||semicolon|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll see before I doubt ||semicolon|| when I doubt ||comma|| prove ||semicolon|| 
And on the proof ||comma|| there is no more but this ||comma|| ||dash|| 
Away at once with love or jealousy ||exclamation_mark|| 
I am glad of it ||semicolon|| for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit: therefore ||comma|| as I am bound ||comma|| 
Receive it from me ||period|| I speak not yet of proof ||period|| 
Look to your wife ||semicolon|| observe her well with Cassio ||semicolon|| 
Wear your eye thus ||comma|| not jealous nor secure:
I would not have your free and noble nature ||comma|| 
Out of self-bounty ||comma|| be abused ||semicolon|| look to ||single_quote|| t:
I know our country disposition well ||semicolon|| 
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
They dare not show their husbands ||semicolon|| their best conscience
Is not to leave ||single_quote|| t undone ||comma|| but keep ||single_quote|| t unknown ||period|| 
Dost thou say so ||question_mark|| 
She did deceive her father ||comma|| marrying you ||semicolon|| 
And when she seem ||single_quote|| d to shake and fear your looks ||comma|| 
She loved them most ||period|| 
And so she did ||period|| 
Why ||comma|| go to then ||semicolon|| 
She that ||comma|| so young ||comma|| could give out such a seeming ||comma|| 
To seal her father ||single_quote|| s eyes up close as oak-
He thought ||single_quote|| twas witchcraft ||dash|| but I am much to blame ||semicolon|| 
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you ||period|| 
I am bound to thee for ever ||period|| 
I see this hath a little dash ||single_quote|| d your spirits ||period|| 
Not a jot ||comma|| not a jot ||period|| 
I ||single_quote|| faith ||comma|| I fear it has ||period|| 
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love ||period|| But I do see you ||single_quote|| re moved:
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion ||period|| 
I will not ||period|| 
Should you do so ||comma|| my lord ||comma|| 
My speech should fall into such vile success
As my thoughts aim not at ||period|| Cassio ||single_quote|| s my worthy friend ||dash|| 
My lord ||comma|| I see you ||single_quote|| re moved ||period|| 
No ||comma|| not much moved:
I do not think but Desdemona ||single_quote|| s honest ||period|| 
Long live she so ||exclamation_mark|| and long live you to think so ||exclamation_mark|| 
And yet ||comma|| how nature erring from itself ||comma|| ||dash|| 
Ay ||comma|| there ||single_quote|| s the point: as ||dash|| to be bold with you ||dash|| 
Not to affect many proposed matches
Of her own clime ||comma|| complexion ||comma|| and degree ||comma|| 
Whereto we see in all things nature tends ||dash|| 
Foh ||exclamation_mark|| one may smell in such a will most rank ||comma|| 
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural ||period|| 
But pardon me ||semicolon|| I do not in position
Distinctly speak of her ||semicolon|| though I may fear
Her will ||comma|| recoiling to her better judgment ||comma|| 
May fall to match you with her country forms
And happily repent ||period|| 
Farewell ||comma|| farewell:
If more thou dost perceive ||comma|| let me know more ||semicolon|| 
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me ||comma|| Iago:
My lord ||comma|| I take my leave ||period|| 
Why did I marry ||question_mark|| This honest creature doubtless
Sees and knows more ||comma|| much more ||comma|| than he unfolds ||period|| 
My lord ||comma|| I would I might entreat
your honour
To scan this thing no further ||semicolon|| leave it to time:
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place ||comma|| 
For sure ||comma|| he fills it up with great ability ||comma|| 
Yet ||comma|| if you please to hold him off awhile ||comma|| 
You shall by that perceive him and his means:
Note ||comma|| if your lady strain his entertainment
With any strong or vehement importunity ||semicolon|| 
Much will be seen in that ||period|| In the mean time ||comma|| 
Let me be thought too busy in my fears ||dash|| 
As worthy cause I have to fear I am ||dash|| 
And hold her free ||comma|| I do beseech your honour ||period|| 
Fear not my government ||period|| 
I once more take my leave ||period|| 
This fellow ||single_quote|| s of exceeding honesty ||comma|| 
And knows all qualities ||comma|| with a learned spirit ||comma|| 
Of human dealings ||period|| If I do prove her haggard ||comma|| 
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings ||comma|| 
I ||single_quote|| ld whistle her off and let her down the wind ||comma|| 
To pray at fortune ||period|| Haply ||comma|| for I am black
And have not those soft parts of conversation
That chamberers have ||comma|| or for I am declined
Into the vale of years ||comma|| ||dash|| yet that ||single_quote|| s not much ||dash|| 
She ||single_quote|| s gone ||period|| I am abused ||semicolon|| and my relief
Must be to loathe her ||period|| O curse of marriage ||comma|| 
That we can call these delicate creatures ours ||comma|| 
And not their appetites ||exclamation_mark|| I had rather be a toad ||comma|| 
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon ||comma|| 
Than keep a corner in the thing I love
For others ||single_quote|| uses ||period|| Yet ||comma|| ||single_quote|| tis the plague of great ones ||semicolon|| 
Prerogatived are they less than the base ||semicolon|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis destiny unshunnable ||comma|| like death:
Even then this forked plague is fated to us
When we do quicken ||period|| Desdemona comes:
If she be false ||comma|| O ||comma|| then heaven mocks itself ||exclamation_mark|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll not believe ||single_quote|| t ||period|| 
How now ||comma|| my dear Othello ||exclamation_mark|| 
Your dinner ||comma|| and the generous islanders
By you invited ||comma|| do attend your presence ||period|| 
I am to blame ||period|| 
Why do you speak so faintly ||question_mark|| 
Are you not well ||question_mark|| 
I have a pain upon my forehead here ||period|| 
 ||single_quote|| Faith ||comma|| that ||single_quote|| s with watching ||semicolon|| ||single_quote|| twill away again:
Let me but bind it hard ||comma|| within this hour
It will be well ||period|| 
Your napkin is too little:
Let it alone ||period|| Come ||comma|| I ||single_quote|| ll go in with you ||period|| 
I am very sorry that you are not well ||period|| 
I am glad I have found this napkin:
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Woo ||single_quote|| d me to steal it ||semicolon|| but she so loves the token ||comma|| 
For he conjured her she should ever keep it ||comma|| 
That she reserves it evermore about her
To kiss and talk to ||period|| I ||single_quote|| ll have the work ta ||single_quote|| en out ||comma|| 
And give ||single_quote|| t Iago: what he will do with it
Heaven knows ||comma|| not I ||semicolon|| 
I nothing but to please his fantasy ||period|| 
How now ||exclamation_mark|| what do you here alone ||question_mark|| 
Do not you chide ||semicolon|| I have a thing for you ||period|| 
A thing for me ||question_mark|| it is a common thing ||dash|| 
Ha ||exclamation_mark|| 
To have a foolish wife ||period|| 
O ||comma|| is that all ||question_mark|| What will you give me now
For the same handkerchief ||question_mark|| 
What handkerchief ||question_mark|| 
What handkerchief ||question_mark|| 
Why ||comma|| that the Moor first gave to Desdemona ||semicolon|| 
That which so often you did bid me steal ||period|| 
Hast stol ||single_quote|| n it from her ||question_mark|| 
No ||comma|| ||single_quote|| faith ||semicolon|| she let it drop by negligence ||period|| 
And ||comma|| to the advantage ||comma|| I ||comma|| being here ||comma|| took ||single_quote|| t up ||period|| 
Look ||comma|| here it is ||period|| 
A good wench ||semicolon|| give it me ||period|| 
What will you do with ||single_quote|| t ||comma|| that you have been
so earnest
To have me filch it ||question_mark|| 
[Snatching it] Why ||comma|| what ||single_quote|| s that to you ||question_mark|| 
If it be not for some purpose of import ||comma|| 
Give ||single_quote|| t me again: poor lady ||comma|| she ||single_quote|| ll run mad
When she shall lack it ||period|| 
Be not acknown on ||single_quote|| t ||semicolon|| I have use for it ||period|| 
Go ||comma|| leave me ||period|| 
I will in Cassio ||single_quote|| s lodging lose this napkin ||comma|| 
And let him find it ||period|| Trifles light as air
Are to the jealous confirmations strong
As proofs of holy writ: this may do something ||period|| 
The Moor already changes with my poison:
Dangerous conceits are ||comma|| in their natures ||comma|| poisons ||period|| 
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste ||comma|| 
But with a little act upon the blood ||period|| 
Burn like the mines of Sulphur ||period|| I did say so:
Look ||comma|| where he comes ||exclamation_mark|| 
Not poppy ||comma|| nor mandragora ||comma|| 
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world ||comma|| 
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
Which thou owedst yesterday ||period|| 
Ha ||exclamation_mark|| ha ||exclamation_mark|| false to me ||question_mark|| 
Why ||comma|| how now ||comma|| general ||exclamation_mark|| no more of that ||period|| 
Avaunt ||exclamation_mark|| be gone ||exclamation_mark|| thou hast set me on the rack:
I swear ||single_quote|| tis better to be much abused
Than but to know ||single_quote|| t a little ||period|| 
How now ||comma|| my lord ||exclamation_mark|| 
What sense had I of her stol ||single_quote|| n hours of lust ||question_mark|| 
I saw ||single_quote|| t not ||comma|| thought it not ||comma|| it harm ||single_quote|| d not me:
I slept the next night well ||comma|| was free and merry ||semicolon|| 
I found not Cassio ||single_quote|| s kisses on her lips:

Let him not know ||single_quote|| t ||comma|| and he ||single_quote|| s not robb ||single_quote|| d at all ||period|| 
I am sorry to hear this ||period||

So I had nothing known ||period|| O ||comma|| now ||comma|| for ever
Farewell the tranquil mind ||exclamation_mark|| farewell content ||exclamation_mark|| 
Farewell the plumed troop ||comma|| and the big wars ||comma|| 
That make ambition virtue ||exclamation_mark|| O ||comma|| farewell ||exclamation_mark|| 
Farewell the neighing steed ||comma|| and the shrill trump ||comma|| 
The spirit-stirring drum ||comma|| the ear-piercing fife ||comma|| 
The royal banner ||comma|| and all quality ||comma|| 
Pride ||comma|| pomp and circumstance of glorious war ||exclamation_mark|| 
And ||comma|| O you mortal engines ||comma|| whose rude throats

Farewell ||exclamation_mark|| Othello ||single_quote|| s occupation ||single_quote|| s gone ||exclamation_mark||

To hang a doubt on ||semicolon|| or woe upon thy life ||exclamation_mark|| 
My noble lord ||comma|| ||dash|| 
If thou dost slander her and torture me ||comma|| 
Never pray more ||semicolon|| abandon all remorse ||semicolon|| 
On horror ||single_quote|| s head horrors accumulate ||semicolon|| 
Do deeds to make heaven weep ||comma|| all earth amazed ||semicolon|| 
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that ||period|| 
O grace ||exclamation_mark|| O heaven forgive me ||exclamation_mark|| 
Are you a man ||question_mark|| have you a soul or sense ||question_mark|| 
God be wi ||single_quote|| you ||semicolon|| take mine office ||period|| O wretched fool ||period||

O monstrous world ||exclamation_mark|| Take note ||comma|| take note ||comma|| O world ||comma|| 
To be direct and honest is not safe ||period|| 
I thank you for this profit ||semicolon|| and from hence

Nay ||comma|| stay: thou shouldst be honest ||period||

And loses that it works for ||period|| 
By the world ||comma||

I think that thou art just and think thou art not ||period|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll have some proof ||period|| Her name ||comma|| that was as fresh
As Dian ||single_quote|| s visage ||comma|| is now begrimed and black

I do repent me that I put it to you ||period|| 
You would be satisfied ||question_mark|| 
Would ||exclamation_mark|| nay ||comma|| I will ||period|| 
And may: but ||comma|| how ||question_mark|| how satisfied ||comma|| my lord ||question_mark|| 
Would you ||comma|| the supervisor ||comma|| grossly gape on ||dash|| 
Behold her topp ||single_quote|| d ||question_mark|| 
Death and damnation ||exclamation_mark|| O ||exclamation_mark|| 
It were a tedious difficulty ||comma|| I think ||comma|| 
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then ||comma|| 
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
More than their own ||exclamation_mark|| What then ||question_mark|| how then ||question_mark|| 
What shall I say ||question_mark|| Where ||single_quote|| s satisfaction ||question_mark|| 
It is impossible you should see this ||comma||

As salt as wolves in pride ||comma|| and fools as gross

Will give you satisfaction ||comma|| you may have ||single_quote|| t ||period|| 
Give me a living reason she ||single_quote|| s disloyal ||period||

But ||comma|| sith I am enter ||single_quote|| d in this cause so far ||comma|| 
Prick ||single_quote|| d to ||single_quote|| t by foolish honesty and love ||comma|| 
I will go on ||period|| I lay with Cassio lately ||semicolon|| 
And ||comma|| being troubled with a raging tooth ||comma|| 
I could not sleep ||period|| 
There are a kind of men so loose of soul ||comma|| 
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
One of this kind is Cassio:
In sleep I heard him say ||single_quote|| Sweet Desdemona ||comma|| 
Let us be wary ||comma|| let us hide our loves ||semicolon|| ||single_quote|| 
And then ||comma|| sir ||comma|| would he gripe and wring my hand ||comma|| 
Cry ||single_quote|| O sweet creature ||exclamation_mark|| ||single_quote|| and then kiss me hard ||comma|| 
As if he pluck ||single_quote|| d up kisses by the roots
That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
Over my thigh ||comma|| and sigh ||single_quote|| d ||comma|| and kiss ||single_quote|| d ||semicolon|| and then
Cried ||single_quote|| Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor ||exclamation_mark|| ||single_quote|| 
O monstrous ||exclamation_mark|| monstrous ||exclamation_mark|| 
Nay ||comma|| this was but his dream ||period|| 
But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
 ||single_quote|| Tis a shrewd doubt ||comma|| though it be but a dream ||period|| 
And this may help to thicken other proofs
That do demonstrate thinly ||period|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll tear her all to pieces ||period|| 
Nay ||comma|| but be wise: yet we see nothing done ||semicolon|| 
She may be honest yet ||period|| Tell me but this ||comma|| 
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
Spotted with strawberries in your wife ||single_quote|| s hand ||question_mark|| 
I gave her such a one ||semicolon|| ||single_quote|| twas my first gift ||period|| 
I know not that ||semicolon|| but such a handkerchief ||dash|| 
I am sure it was your wife ||single_quote|| s ||dash|| did I to-day
See Cassio wipe his beard with ||period|| 
If it be that ||dash|| 
If it be that ||comma|| or any that was hers ||comma|| 
It speaks against her with the other proofs ||period|| 
O ||comma|| that the slave had forty thousand lives ||exclamation_mark|| 
One is too poor ||comma|| too weak for my revenge ||period|| 
Now do I see ||single_quote|| tis true ||period|| Look here ||comma|| Iago ||semicolon|| 
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven ||period|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis gone ||period|| 
Arise ||comma|| black vengeance ||comma|| from thy hollow cell ||exclamation_mark|| 
Yield up ||comma|| O love ||comma|| thy crown and hearted throne
To tyrannous hate ||exclamation_mark|| Swell ||comma|| bosom ||comma|| with thy fraught ||comma|| 
For ||single_quote|| tis of aspics ||single_quote|| tongues ||exclamation_mark|| 
Yet be content ||period|| 
O ||comma|| blood ||comma|| blood ||comma|| blood ||exclamation_mark|| 
Patience ||comma|| I say ||semicolon|| your mind perhaps may change ||period|| 
Never ||comma|| Iago: Like to the Pontic sea ||comma|| 
Whose icy current and compulsive course
Ne ||single_quote|| er feels retiring ebb ||comma|| but keeps due on
To the Propontic and the Hellespont ||comma|| 
Even so my bloody thoughts ||comma|| with violent pace ||comma|| 
Shall ne ||single_quote|| er look back ||comma|| ne ||single_quote|| er ebb to humble love ||comma|| 
Till that a capable and wide revenge
Swallow them up ||period|| Now ||comma|| by yond marble heaven ||comma|| 
In the due reverence of a sacred vow
I here engage my words ||period|| 
Do not rise yet ||period|| 
Witness ||comma|| you ever-burning lights above ||comma|| 
You elements that clip us round about ||comma|| 
Witness that here Iago doth give up
The execution of his wit ||comma|| hands ||comma|| heart ||comma|| 
To wrong ||single_quote|| d Othello ||single_quote|| s service ||exclamation_mark|| Let him command ||comma|| 
And to obey shall be in me remorse ||comma|| 
What bloody business ever ||period|| 
I greet thy love ||comma|| 
Not with vain thanks ||comma|| but with acceptance bounteous ||comma|| 
And will upon the instant put thee to ||single_quote|| t:
Within these three days let me hear thee say

My friend is dead ||semicolon|| ||single_quote|| tis done at your request:
But let her live ||period|| 
Damn her ||comma|| lewd minx ||exclamation_mark|| O ||comma|| damn her ||exclamation_mark|| 
Come ||comma|| go with me apart ||semicolon|| I will withdraw ||comma|| 
To furnish me with some swift means of death
For the fair devil ||period|| Now art thou my lieutenant ||period|| 
I am your own for ever ||period|| 
Do you know ||comma|| sirrah ||comma|| where Lieutenant Cassio lies ||question_mark|| 
I dare not say he lies any where ||period|| 
Why ||comma|| man ||question_mark|| 
He ||single_quote|| s a soldier ||comma|| and for one to say a soldier lies ||comma|| 
is stabbing ||period|| 
Go to: where lodges he ||question_mark|| 
To tell you where he lodges ||comma|| is to tell you where I lie ||period|| 
Can any thing be made of this ||question_mark|| 
I know not where he lodges ||comma|| and for me to devise a
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there ||comma|| were
to lie in mine own throat ||period|| 
Can you inquire him out ||comma|| and be edified by report ||question_mark|| 
I will catechise the world for him ||semicolon|| that is ||comma|| make
questions ||comma|| and by them answer ||period|| 
Seek him ||comma|| bid him come hither: tell him I have
moved my lord on his behalf ||comma|| and hope all will be well ||period|| 
To do this is within the compass of man ||single_quote|| s wit: and
therefore I will attempt the doing it ||period|| 
Where should I lose that handkerchief ||comma|| Emilia ||question_mark|| 
I know not ||comma|| madam ||period|| 
Believe me ||comma|| I had rather have lost my purse
Full of crusadoes: and ||comma|| but my noble Moor
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are ||comma|| it were enough
To put him to ill thinking ||period|| 
Is he not jealous ||question_mark|| 
Who ||comma|| he ||question_mark|| I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humours from him ||period|| 
Look ||comma|| where he comes ||period|| 
I will not leave him now till Cassio
Be call ||single_quote|| d to him ||period|| 
How is ||single_quote|| t with you ||comma|| my lord
Well ||comma|| my good lady ||period||

How do you ||comma|| Desdemona ||question_mark|| 
Well ||comma|| my good lord ||period|| 
Give me your hand: this hand is moist ||comma|| my lady ||period|| 
It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow ||period|| 
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
Hot ||comma|| hot ||comma|| and moist: this hand of yours requires
A sequester from liberty ||comma|| fasting and prayer ||comma|| 
Much castigation ||comma|| exercise devout ||semicolon|| 
For here ||single_quote|| s a young and sweating devil here ||comma|| 
That commonly rebels ||period|| ||single_quote|| Tis a good hand ||comma|| 
A frank one ||period|| 
You may ||comma|| indeed ||comma|| say so ||semicolon|| 
For ||single_quote|| twas that hand that gave away my heart ||period|| 
A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands ||semicolon|| 
But our new heraldry is hands ||comma|| not hearts ||period|| 
I cannot speak of this ||period|| Come now ||comma|| your promise ||period|| 
What promise ||comma|| chuck ||question_mark|| 
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you ||period|| 
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me ||semicolon|| 
Lend me thy handkerchief ||period|| 
Here ||comma|| my lord ||period|| 
That which I gave you ||period|| 
I have it not about me ||period|| 
Not ||question_mark|| 
No ||comma|| indeed ||comma|| my lord ||period|| 
That is a fault ||period|| 
That handkerchief
Did an Egyptian to my mother give ||semicolon|| 
She was a charmer ||comma|| and could almost read
The thoughts of people: she told her ||comma|| while
she kept it ||comma|| 
 ||single_quote|| Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
Entirely to her love ||comma|| but if she lost it
Or made gift of it ||comma|| my father ||single_quote|| s eye
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
After new fancies: she ||comma|| dying ||comma|| gave it me ||semicolon|| 
And bid me ||comma|| when my fate would have me wive ||comma|| 
To give it her ||period|| I did so: and take heed on ||single_quote|| t ||semicolon|| 
Make it a darling like your precious eye ||semicolon|| 
To lose ||single_quote|| t or give ||single_quote|| t away were such perdition
As nothing else could match ||period|| 
Is ||single_quote|| t possible ||question_mark|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis true: there ||single_quote|| s magic in the web of it:
A sibyl ||comma|| that had number ||single_quote|| d in the world
The sun to course two hundred compasses ||comma|| 
In her prophetic fury sew ||single_quote|| d the work ||semicolon|| 
The worms were hallow ||single_quote|| d that did breed the silk ||semicolon|| 
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
Conserved of maidens ||single_quote|| hearts ||period|| 
Indeed ||exclamation_mark|| is ||single_quote|| t true ||question_mark|| 
Most veritable ||semicolon|| therefore look to ||single_quote|| t well ||period|| 
Then would to God that I had never seen ||single_quote|| t ||exclamation_mark|| 
Ha ||exclamation_mark|| wherefore ||question_mark|| 
Why do you speak so startingly and rash ||question_mark|| 
Is ||single_quote|| t lost ||question_mark|| is ||single_quote|| t gone ||question_mark|| speak ||comma|| is it out
o ||single_quote|| the way ||question_mark|| 
Heaven bless us ||exclamation_mark|| 
Say you ||question_mark|| 
It is not lost ||semicolon|| but what an if it were ||question_mark|| 
How ||exclamation_mark|| 
I say ||comma|| it is not lost ||period|| 
Fetch ||single_quote|| t ||comma|| let me see ||single_quote|| t ||period|| 
Why ||comma|| so I can ||comma|| sir ||comma|| but I will not now ||period|| 
This is a trick to put me from my suit:
Pray you ||comma|| let Cassio be received again ||period|| 
Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives ||period|| 
Come ||comma|| come ||semicolon|| 
You ||single_quote|| ll never meet a more sufficient man ||period|| 
The handkerchief ||exclamation_mark||

A man that all his time
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love ||comma|| 
Shared dangers with you ||comma|| ||dash||

In sooth ||comma|| you are to blame ||period|| 
Away ||exclamation_mark|| 
Is not this man jealous ||question_mark|| 
I ne ||single_quote|| er saw this before ||period|| 
Sure ||comma|| there ||single_quote|| s some wonder in this handkerchief:
I am most unhappy in the loss of it ||period|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
They are all but stomachs ||comma|| and we all but food ||semicolon|| 
To eat us hungerly ||comma|| and when they are full ||comma|| 
They belch us ||period|| Look you ||comma|| Cassio and my husband ||exclamation_mark|| 
There is no other way ||semicolon|| ||single_quote|| tis she must do ||single_quote|| t:
And ||comma|| lo ||comma|| the happiness ||exclamation_mark|| go ||comma|| and importune her ||period|| 
How now ||comma|| good Cassio ||exclamation_mark|| what ||single_quote|| s the news with you ||question_mark|| 
Madam ||comma|| my former suit: I do beseech you
That by your virtuous means I may again
Exist ||comma|| and be a member of his love
Whom I with all the office of my heart
Entirely honour: I would not be delay ||single_quote|| d ||period|| 
If my offence be of such mortal kind
That nor my service past ||comma|| nor present sorrows ||comma|| 
Nor purposed merit in futurity ||comma|| 
Can ransom me into his love again ||comma|| 
But to know so must be my benefit ||semicolon|| 
So shall I clothe me in a forced content ||comma|| 
And shut myself up in some other course ||comma|| 
To fortune ||single_quote|| s alms ||period|| 
Alas ||comma|| thrice-gentle Cassio ||exclamation_mark|| 
My advocation is not now in tune ||semicolon|| 
My lord is not my lord ||semicolon|| nor should I know him ||comma|| 
Were he in favour as in humour alter ||single_quote|| d ||period|| 
So help me every spirit sanctified ||comma|| 
As I have spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech ||exclamation_mark|| you must awhile be patient:
What I can do I will ||semicolon|| and more I will
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you ||period|| 
Is my lord angry ||question_mark|| 
He went hence but now ||comma|| 
And certainly in strange unquietness ||period|| 
Can he be angry ||question_mark|| I have seen the cannon ||comma|| 
When it hath blown his ranks into the air ||comma|| 
And ||comma|| like the devil ||comma|| from his very arm

Yea ||comma|| Richard ||comma|| when I know ||semicolon|| for I protest
As yet I do not: but ||comma|| as I can learn ||comma|| 
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams ||semicolon|| 
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G ||period|| 
And says a wizard told him that by G
His issue disinherited should be ||semicolon||

It follows in his thought that I am he ||period||

Have moved his highness to commit me now ||period|| 
Why ||comma|| this it is ||comma|| when men are ruled by women:

My Lady Grey his wife ||comma|| Clarence ||comma|| ||single_quote|| tis she
That tempers him to this extremity ||period|| 
Was it not she and that good man of worship ||comma||

Since that our brother dubb ||single_quote|| d them gentlewomen ||period||

That no man shall have private conference ||comma|| 
Of what degree soever ||comma|| with his brother ||period|| 
Even so ||semicolon|| an ||single_quote|| t please your worship ||comma|| Brakenbury ||comma|| 
You may partake of any thing we say:
We speak no treason ||comma|| man: we say the king
Is wise and virtuous ||comma|| and his noble queen
Well struck in years ||comma|| fair ||comma|| and not jealous ||semicolon|| 
We say that Shore ||single_quote|| s wife hath a pretty foot ||comma|| 
A cherry lip ||comma|| a bonny eye ||comma|| a passing pleasing tongue ||semicolon||

With this ||comma|| my lord ||comma|| myself have nought to do ||period|| 
Naught to do with mistress Shore ||exclamation_mark|| I tell thee ||comma|| fellow ||comma||

Now ||comma|| by Saint Paul ||comma|| this news is bad indeed ||period|| 
O ||comma|| he hath kept an evil diet long ||comma|| 
And overmuch consumed his royal person:

What ||comma|| is he in his bed ||question_mark|| 
He is ||period|| 
Go you before ||comma|| and I will follow you ||period|| 
He cannot live ||comma|| I hope ||semicolon|| and must not die

And ||comma|| if I fall not in my deep intent ||comma|| 
Clarence hath not another day to live:
Which done ||comma|| God take King Edward to his mercy ||comma||

For then I ||single_quote|| ll marry Warwick ||single_quote|| s youngest daughter ||period|| 
What though I kill ||single_quote|| d her husband and her father ||question_mark||

Is to become her husband and her father:

As for another secret close intent ||comma|| 
By marrying her which I must reach unto ||period|| 
But yet I run before my horse to market:
Clarence still breathes ||semicolon|| Edward still lives and reigns:
When they are gone ||comma|| then must I count my gains ||period|| 
Set down ||comma|| set down your honourable load ||comma|| 
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse ||comma||

To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him ||semicolon|| 
Nor when thy warlike father ||comma|| like a child ||comma|| 
Told the sad story of my father ||single_quote|| s death ||comma||

Lo ||comma|| here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword ||semicolon|| 
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom ||period||

I lay it naked to the deadly stroke ||comma|| 
And humbly beg the death upon my knee ||period|| 
Nay ||comma|| do not pause ||semicolon|| for I did kill King Henry ||comma||

Therefore ||comma|| for God ||single_quote|| s sake ||comma|| entertain good comfort ||comma|| 
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words ||period|| 
If he were dead ||comma|| what would betide of me ||question_mark|| 
No other harm but loss of such a lord ||period|| 
The loss of such a lord includes all harm ||period|| 
The heavens have bless ||single_quote|| d you with a goodly son ||comma||

Would all were well ||exclamation_mark|| but that will never be

Welcome ||comma|| sweet prince ||comma|| to London ||comma|| to your chamber ||period|| 
Welcome ||comma|| dear cousin ||comma|| my thoughts ||single_quote|| sovereign

No ||comma|| uncle ||semicolon|| but our crosses on the way
Have made it tedious ||comma|| wearisome ||comma|| and heavy
I want more uncles here to welcome me ||period|| 
Sweet prince ||comma|| the untainted virtue of your years
Hath not yet dived into the world ||single_quote|| s deceit
Nor more can you distinguish of a man

Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart ||period|| 
Those uncles which you want were dangerous ||semicolon||

CARDINAL
My Lord of Buckingham ||comma|| if my weak oratory

To mild entreaties ||comma|| God in heaven forbid
We should infringe the holy privilege
Of blessed sanctuary ||exclamation_mark|| not for all this land
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin ||period|| 
You are too senseless ||dash|| obstinate ||comma|| my lord ||comma|| 
Too ceremonious and traditional
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age ||comma|| 
You break not sanctuary in seizing him ||period|| 
The benefit thereof is always granted
To those whose dealings have deserved the place ||comma|| 
And those who have the wit to claim the place:
This prince hath neither claim ||single_quote|| d it nor deserved it ||semicolon|| 
And therefore ||comma|| in mine opinion ||comma|| cannot have it:
Then ||comma|| taking him from thence that is not there ||comma|| 
You break no privilege nor charter there ||period||

And therefore is he idle ||question_mark|| 
O ||comma|| my fair cousin ||comma|| I must not say so ||period||

Then is he more beholding to you than I ||period||

Because that I am little ||comma|| like an ape ||comma|| 
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders ||period|| 
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons ||exclamation_mark|| 
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle ||comma||

He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
Besides ||comma|| he says there are two councils held ||semicolon|| 
And that may be determined at the one
which may make you and him to rue at the other ||period|| 
Therefore he sends to know your lordship ||single_quote|| s pleasure ||comma||

Go ||comma|| fellow ||comma|| go ||comma|| return unto thy lord ||semicolon|| 
Bid him not fear the separated councils
His honour and myself are at the one ||comma|| 
And at the other is my servant Catesby
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
Whereof I shall not have intelligence ||period|| 
Tell him his fears are shallow ||comma|| wanting instance:
And for his dreams ||comma|| I wonder he is so fond

Upon his party for the gain thereof:
And thereupon he sends you this good news ||comma|| 
That this same very day your enemies ||comma|| 
The kindred of the queen ||comma|| must die at Pomfret ||period|| 
Indeed ||comma|| I am no mourner for that news ||comma|| 
Because they have been still mine enemies:

So dear I loved the man ||comma|| that I must weep ||period||

Unto the citizens ||comma|| who haply may
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death ||period||

Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen ||comma|| 
Only for saying he would make his son

Which ||comma|| by the sign thereof was termed so ||period|| 
Moreover ||comma|| urge his hateful luxury

Nay ||comma|| for a need ||comma|| thus far come near my person:
Tell them ||comma|| when that my mother went with child
Of that unsatiate Edward ||comma|| noble York
My princely father then had wars in France
And ||comma|| by just computation of the time ||comma|| 
Found that the issue was not his begot ||semicolon|| 
Which well appeared in his lineaments ||comma|| 
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
But touch this sparingly ||comma|| as ||single_quote|| twere far off ||comma||

Which in a set hand fairly is engross ||single_quote|| d ||comma|| 
That it may be this day read over in Paul ||single_quote|| s ||period|| 
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
Eleven hours I spent to write it over ||comma|| 
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me ||semicolon|| 
The precedent was full as long a-doing:
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings ||comma|| 
Untainted ||comma|| unexamined ||comma|| free ||comma|| at liberty
Here ||single_quote|| s a good world the while ||exclamation_mark|| Why who ||single_quote|| s so gross ||comma|| 
That seeth not this palpable device ||question_mark||

And his enforcement of the city wives ||semicolon|| 
His tyranny for trifles ||semicolon|| his own bastardy ||comma|| 
As being got ||comma|| your father then in France ||comma|| 
His resemblance ||comma|| being not like the duke ||semicolon|| 
Withal I did infer your lineaments ||comma|| 
Being the right idea of your father ||comma|| 
Both in your form and nobleness of mind ||semicolon|| 
Laid open all your victories in Scotland ||comma|| 
Your dicipline in war ||comma|| wisdom in peace ||comma|| 
Your bounty ||comma|| virtue ||comma|| fair humility:
Indeed ||comma|| left nothing fitting for the purpose
Untouch ||single_quote|| d ||comma|| or slightly handled ||comma|| in discourse
And when mine oratory grew to an end
I bid them that did love their country ||single_quote|| s good
Cry ||single_quote|| God save Richard ||comma|| England ||single_quote|| s royal king ||exclamation_mark|| ||single_quote|| 
Ah ||exclamation_mark|| and did they so ||question_mark|| 
No ||comma|| so God help me ||comma|| they spake not a word ||semicolon|| 
But ||comma|| like dumb statues or breathing stones ||comma|| 
Gazed each on other ||comma|| and look ||single_quote|| d deadly pale ||period|| 
Which when I saw ||comma|| I reprehended them ||semicolon|| 
And ask ||single_quote|| d the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
His answer was ||comma|| the people were not wont
To be spoke to but by the recorder ||period|| 
Then he was urged to tell my tale again ||comma|| 
 ||single_quote|| Thus saith the duke ||comma|| thus hath the duke inferr ||single_quote|| d ||semicolon|| ||single_quote|| 
But nothing spake in warrant from himself ||period|| 
When he had done ||comma|| some followers of mine own ||comma|| 
At the lower end of the hall ||comma|| hurl ||single_quote|| d up their caps ||comma|| 
And some ten voices cried ||single_quote|| God save King Richard ||exclamation_mark|| ||single_quote|| 
And thus I took the vantage of those few ||comma|| 
 ||single_quote|| Thanks ||comma|| gentle citizens and friends ||comma|| ||single_quote|| quoth I ||semicolon||

Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard: ||single_quote||

What tongueless blocks were they ||exclamation_mark|| would not they speak ||question_mark|| 
No ||comma|| by my troth ||comma|| my lord ||period|| 
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come ||question_mark|| 
The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear ||semicolon|| 
Be not you spoke with ||comma|| but by mighty suit:
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand ||comma|| 
And stand betwixt two churchmen ||comma|| good my lord ||semicolon|| 
For on that ground I ||single_quote|| ll build a holy descant:
And be not easily won to our request:

But on his knees at meditation ||semicolon|| 
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans ||comma|| 
But meditating with two deep divines ||semicolon|| 
Not sleeping ||comma|| to engross his idle body ||comma|| 
But praying ||comma|| to enrich his watchful soul:
Happy were England ||comma|| would this gracious prince
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
But ||comma|| sure ||comma|| I fear ||comma|| we shall ne ||single_quote|| er win him to it ||period|| 
Marry ||comma|| God forbid his grace should say us nay ||exclamation_mark||

Such troops of citizens to speak with him ||comma|| 
His grace not being warn ||single_quote|| d thereof before:
My lord ||comma|| he fears you mean no good to him ||period|| 
Sorry I am my noble cousin should
Suspect me ||comma|| that I mean no good to him:
By heaven ||comma|| I come in perfect love to him ||semicolon|| 
And so once more return and tell his grace ||period|| 
When holy and devout religious men
Are at their beads ||comma|| ||single_quote|| tis hard to draw them thence ||comma|| 
So sweet is zealous contemplation ||period|| 
See ||comma|| where he stands between two clergymen ||exclamation_mark|| 
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince ||comma|| 
To stay him from the fall of vanity:
And ||comma|| see ||comma|| a book of prayer in his hand ||comma|| 
True ornaments to know a holy man ||period|| 
Famous Plantagenet ||comma|| most gracious prince ||comma|| 
Lend favourable ears to our request ||semicolon|| 
And pardon us the interruption
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal ||period|| 
My lord ||comma|| there needs no such apology:

So many miles upon her peaceful bosom ||comma|| 
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
And ostentation of despised arms ||question_mark|| 
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence ||question_mark|| 
Why ||comma|| foolish boy ||comma|| the king is left behind ||comma|| 
And in my loyal bosom lies his power ||period|| 
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt ||comma|| thy father ||comma|| and myself
Rescued the Black Prince ||comma|| that young Mars of men ||comma|| 
From forth the ranks of many thousand French ||comma|| 
O ||comma|| then how quickly should this arm of mine ||period||

We all have strongly sworn to give him aid ||semicolon||

Well ||comma|| well ||comma|| I see the issue of these arms:
I cannot mend it ||comma|| I must needs confess ||comma|| 
Because my power is weak and all ill left:
But if I could ||comma|| by Him that gave me life ||comma||

Unto the sovereign mercy of the king ||semicolon||

Of holy reverence ||semicolon|| who ||comma|| I cannot learn ||period|| 
O ||comma|| belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle ||period||

Tell Bolingbroke ||dash|| for yond methinks he stands ||dash||

The purple testament of bleeding war ||semicolon|| 
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace ||comma|| 
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers ||single_quote|| sons

Part of your cares you give me with your crown ||period|| 
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down ||period|| 
My care is loss of care ||comma|| by old care done ||semicolon||

But they can see a sort of traitors here ||period|| 
Nay ||comma|| if I turn mine eyes upon myself ||comma|| 
I find myself a traitor with the rest ||semicolon|| 
For I have given here my soul ||single_quote|| s consent

Good king ||comma|| great king ||comma|| and yet not greatly good ||comma||

It is too little ||comma|| helping him to all ||semicolon|| 
And he shall think that thou ||comma|| which know ||single_quote|| st the way

Did scowl on gentle Richard ||semicolon|| no man cried ||single_quote|| God save him ||exclamation_mark|| ||single_quote|| 
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off ||comma||

The badges of his grief and patience ||comma|| 
That had not God ||comma|| for some strong purpose ||comma|| steel ||single_quote|| d

Of healths five-fathom deep ||semicolon|| and then anon
Drums in his ear ||comma|| at which he starts and wakes ||comma||

Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him

Because it is an enemy to thee ||semicolon|| 
Had I it written ||comma|| I would tear the word ||period||

With love ||single_quote|| s light wings did I o ||single_quote|| er-perch these walls ||semicolon||

Revolts from true birth ||comma|| stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice ||comma|| being misapplied ||semicolon||

Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this ||comma|| being smelt ||comma|| with that part cheers each part ||semicolon|| 
Being tasted ||comma|| slays all senses with the heart ||period||

O ||comma|| bid me leap ||comma|| rather than marry Paris ||comma|| 
From off the battlements of yonder tower ||semicolon|| 
Or walk in thievish ways ||semicolon|| or bid me lurk

Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house ||comma|| 
O ||single_quote|| er-cover ||single_quote|| d quite with dead men ||single_quote|| s rattling bones ||comma|| 
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls ||semicolon|| 
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud ||semicolon|| 
Things that ||comma|| to hear them told ||comma|| have made me tremble ||semicolon|| 
And I will do it without fear or doubt ||comma||

No warmth ||comma|| no breath ||comma|| shall testify thou livest ||semicolon|| 
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes ||comma|| thy eyes ||single_quote|| windows fall ||comma|| 
Like death ||comma|| when he shuts up the day of life ||semicolon|| 
Each part ||comma|| deprived of supple government ||comma||

Preposterous ass ||comma|| that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordain ||single_quote|| d ||exclamation_mark|| 
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain ||question_mark||

And while I pause ||comma|| serve in your harmony ||period|| 
Sirrah ||comma|| I will not bear these braves of thine ||period||

But what a fool am I to chat with you ||comma||

Crownets of pearl about his naked arms ||comma||

It is our pleasure ||semicolon|| we will have it so ||period|| 
Your grace doth well to place him by your side ||comma|| 
For nowhere else the new earl is so safe ||period|| 
What man of noble birth can brook this sight ||question_mark|| 
See ||comma|| what a scornful look the peasant casts ||exclamation_mark|| 
Can kingly lions fawn on creeping ants ||question_mark|| 
Ignoble vassal ||comma|| that ||comma|| like Phaeton ||comma|| 
Aspir ||single_quote|| st unto the guidance of the sun ||exclamation_mark|| 
Their downfall is at hand ||comma|| their forces down:
We will not thus be fac ||single_quote|| d and over-peer ||single_quote|| d ||period|| 
Lay hands on that traitor Mortimer ||exclamation_mark|| 
Lay hands on that traitor Gaveston ||exclamation_mark|| 
Is this the duty that you owe your king ||question_mark|| 
We know our duties ||semicolon|| let him know his peers ||period|| 
Whither will you bear him ||question_mark|| stay ||comma|| or ye shall die ||period|| 
We are no traitors ||semicolon|| therefore threaten not ||period|| 
 No ||comma|| threaten not ||comma|| my lord ||comma|| but pay them home ||period||

Thou ||comma|| villain ||exclamation_mark|| wherefore talk ||single_quote|| st thou of a king ||comma||

Warwick and Lancaster ||comma|| wear you my crown ||period|| 
Was ever king thus over-rul ||single_quote|| d as I ||question_mark||

What we have done ||comma|| our heart-blood shall maintain ||period|| 
Think you that we can brook this upstart[ ||single_quote|| s] pride ||question_mark|| 
Anger and wrathful fury stops my speech ||period|| 
Why are you not mov ||single_quote|| d ||question_mark|| be patient ||comma|| my lord ||comma|| 
And see what we your counsellors have done ||period|| 
My lords ||comma|| now let us all be resolute ||comma|| 
And either have our wills ||comma|| or lose our lives ||period|| 
Meet you for this ||comma|| proud over-daring peers ||exclamation_mark||

Subscribe ||comma|| as we have done ||comma|| to his exile ||period|| 
Curse him ||comma|| if he refuse ||semicolon|| and then may we
Depose him ||comma|| and elect another king ||period|| 
Ay ||comma|| there it goes ||exclamation_mark|| but yet I will not yield:
Curse me ||comma|| depose me ||comma|| do the worst you can ||period|| 
Then linger not ||comma|| my lord ||comma|| but do it straight ||period|| 
Remember how the bishop was abus ||single_quote|| d:
Either banish him that was the cause thereof ||comma|| 
Or I will presently discharge these lords
Of duty and allegiance due to thee ||period|| 
It boots me not to threat ||semicolon|| I must speak fair:
The legate of the Pope will be obey ||single_quote|| d ||period|| ||dash|| 
My lord ||comma|| you shall be Chancellor of the realm ||semicolon|| 
Thou ||comma|| Lancaster ||comma|| High-Admiral of our fleet ||semicolon|| 
Young Mortimer and his uncle shall be earls ||semicolon|| 
And you ||comma|| Lord Warwick ||comma|| President of the North ||semicolon|| 
And thou of Wales ||period|| If this content you not ||comma|| 
Make several kingdoms of this monarchy ||comma|| 
And share it equally amongst you all ||comma|| 
So I may have some nook or corner left ||comma|| 
To frolic with my dearest Gaveston ||period|| 
Nothing shall alter us ||semicolon|| we are resolv ||single_quote|| d ||period|| 
Come ||comma|| come ||comma|| subscribe ||period|| 
Why should you love him whom the world hates so ||question_mark|| 
Because he loves me more than all the world ||period|| 
Ah ||comma|| none but rude and savage-minded men
Would seek the ruin of my Gaveston ||exclamation_mark|| 
You that be noble-born should pity him ||period|| 
You that are princely-born should shake him off:
For shame ||comma|| subscribe ||comma|| and let the clown depart ||period|| 
Urge him ||comma|| my lord ||period|| 
Are you content to banish him the realm ||question_mark|| 
I see I must ||comma|| and therefore am content:
Instead of ink ||comma|| I ||single_quote|| ll write it with my tears ||period|| 
The king is love-sick for his minion ||period|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis done: and now ||comma|| accursed hand ||comma|| fall off ||exclamation_mark|| 
Give it me: I ||single_quote|| ll have it publish ||single_quote|| d in the streets ||period|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll see him presently despatch ||single_quote|| d away ||period|| 
Now is my heart at ease ||period|| 
And so is mine ||period|| 
This will be good news to the common sort ||period|| 
Be it or no ||comma|| he shall not linger here ||period|| 
How fast they run to banish him I love ||exclamation_mark|| 
They would not stir ||comma|| were it to do me good ||period|| 
Why should a king be subject to a priest ||question_mark|| 
Proud Rome ||comma|| that hatchest such imperial grooms ||comma|| 
With these thy superstitious taper-lights ||comma|| 
Wherewith thy antichristian churches blaze ||comma|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll fire thy crazed buildings ||comma|| and enforce
The papal towers to kiss the lowly ground ||comma|| 
With slaughter ||single_quote|| d priests make Tiber ||single_quote|| s channel swell ||comma|| 
And banks rais ||single_quote|| d higher with their sepulchres ||exclamation_mark|| 
As for the peers ||comma|| that back the clergy thus ||comma|| 
If I be king ||comma|| not one of them shall live ||period|| 
My lord ||comma|| I hear it whisper ||single_quote|| d everywhere ||comma|| 
That I am banish ||single_quote|| d and must fly the land ||period|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis true ||comma|| sweet Gaveston: O were it false ||exclamation_mark|| 
The legate of the Pope will have it so ||comma|| 
And thou must hence ||comma|| or I shall be depos ||single_quote|| d ||period|| 
But I will reign to be reveng ||single_quote|| d of them ||semicolon|| 
And therefore ||comma|| sweet friend ||comma|| take it patiently ||period|| 
Live where thou wilt ||comma|| I ||single_quote|| ll send thee gold enough ||semicolon||

 Is all my hope turn ||single_quote|| d to this hell of grief ||question_mark|| 
Rend not my heart with thy too-piercing words:
Thou from this land ||comma|| I from myself am banish ||single_quote|| d ||period|| 
 To go from hence grieves not poor Gaveston ||semicolon|| 
But to forsake you ||comma|| in whose gracious looks
The blessedness of Gaveston remains ||semicolon|| 
For nowhere else seeks he felicity ||period|| 
And only this torments my wretched soul ||comma|| 
That ||comma|| whether I will or no ||comma|| thou must depart ||period|| 
Be governor of Ireland in my stead ||comma|| 
And there abide till fortune call thee home ||period|| 
Here ||comma|| take my picture ||comma|| and let me wear thine:
O ||comma|| might I keep thee here ||comma|| as I do this ||comma|| 
Happy were I ||exclamation_mark|| but now most miserable ||period|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis something to be pitied of a king ||period|| 
Thou shalt not hence ||semicolon|| I ||single_quote|| ll hide thee ||comma|| Gaveston ||period|| 
 I shall be found ||comma|| and then ||single_quote|| twill grieve me more ||period|| 
Kind words and mutual talk makes our grief greater:
Therefore ||comma|| with dumb embracement ||comma|| let us part ||comma|| 
Stay ||comma|| Gaveston ||semicolon|| I cannot leave thee thus ||period|| 
 For every look ||comma|| my love drops down a tear:
Seeing I must go ||comma|| do not renew my sorrow ||period|| 
The time is little that thou hast to stay ||comma|| 
And ||comma|| therefore ||comma|| give me leave to look my fill ||period|| 
But ||comma|| come ||comma|| sweet friend ||semicolon|| I ||single_quote|| ll bear thee on thy way ||period|| 
 The peers will frown ||period|| 
I pass not for their anger ||period|| Come ||comma|| let ||single_quote|| s go:
O ||comma|| that we might as well return as go ||exclamation_mark|| 
Whither goes my lord ||question_mark|| 
Fawn not on me ||comma|| French strumpet ||semicolon|| get thee gone ||exclamation_mark|| 
On whom but on my husband should I fawn ||question_mark|| 
 On Mortimer ||semicolon|| with whom ||comma|| ungentle queen ||comma|| ||dash|| 
I judge no more ||dash|| judge you the rest ||comma|| my lord ||period|| 
In saying this ||comma|| thou wrong ||single_quote|| st me ||comma|| Gaveston:
Is ||single_quote|| t not enough that thou corrupt ||single_quote|| st my lord ||comma|| 
And art a bawd to his affections ||comma|| 
But thou must call mine honour thus in question ||question_mark|| 
 I mean not so ||semicolon|| your grace must pardon me ||period|| 
Thou art too familiar with that Mortimer ||comma|| 
And by thy means is Gaveston exil ||single_quote|| d:
But I would wish thee reconcile the lords ||comma|| 
Or thou shalt ne ||single_quote|| er be reconcil ||single_quote|| d to me ||period|| 
Your highness knows ||comma|| it lies not in my power ||period|| 
Away ||comma|| then ||exclamation_mark|| touch me not ||period|| ||dash|| Come ||comma|| Gaveston ||period|| 
Villain ||comma|| ||single_quote|| tis thou that robb ||single_quote|| st me of my lord ||period||

Speak not unto her: let her droop and pine ||period|| 
Wherein ||comma|| my lord ||comma|| have I deserv ||single_quote|| d these words ||question_mark|| 
Witness the tears that Isabella sheds ||comma|| 
Witness this heart ||comma|| that ||comma|| sighing for thee ||comma|| breaks ||comma|| 
How dear my lord is to poor Isabel ||exclamation_mark|| 
And witness heaven how dear thou art to me:
There weep ||semicolon|| for ||comma|| till my Gaveston be repeal ||single_quote|| d ||comma|| 
Assure thyself thou com ||single_quote|| st not in my sight ||period|| 
O miserable and distressed queen ||exclamation_mark|| 
Would ||comma|| when I left sweet France ||comma|| and was embarked ||comma|| 
That charming Circe ||comma|| walking on the waves ||comma|| 
Had chang ||single_quote|| d my shape ||exclamation_mark|| or at the marriage-day
The cup of Hymen had been full of poison ||exclamation_mark|| 
Or with those arms ||comma|| that twin ||single_quote|| d about my neck ||comma|| 
I had been stifled ||comma|| and not liv ||single_quote|| d to see
The king my lord thus to abandon me ||exclamation_mark|| 
Like frantic Juno ||comma|| will I fill the earth
With ghastly murmur of my sighs and cries ||semicolon|| 
For never doted Jove on Ganymede
So much as he on cursed Gaveston:
But that will more exasperate his wrath ||semicolon|| 
I must entreat him ||comma|| I must speak him fair ||comma|| 
And be a means to call home Gaveston:
And yet he ||single_quote|| ll ever dote on Gaveston ||semicolon|| 
And so am I for ever miserable ||period|| 
Look ||comma|| where the sister of the king of France
Sits wringing of her hands and beats her breast ||exclamation_mark|| 
The king ||comma|| I fear ||comma|| hath ill-treated her ||period|| 
Hard is the heart that injures such a saint ||period|| 
I know ||single_quote|| tis ||single_quote|| long of Gaveston she weeps ||period|| 
Why ||comma|| he is gone ||period|| 
Madam ||comma|| how fares your grace ||question_mark|| 
Ah ||comma|| Mortimer ||comma|| now breaks the king ||single_quote|| s hate forth ||comma|| 
And he confesseth that he loves me not ||exclamation_mark|| 
Cry quittance ||comma|| madam ||comma|| then ||comma|| and love not him ||period|| 
No ||comma|| rather will I die a thousand deaths:
And yet I love in vain ||semicolon|| he ||single_quote|| ll ne ||single_quote|| er love me ||period|| 
Fear ye not ||comma|| madam ||semicolon|| now his minion ||single_quote|| s gone ||comma|| 
His wanton humour will be quickly left ||period|| 
O ||comma|| never ||comma|| Lancaster ||exclamation_mark|| I am enjoin ||single_quote|| d ||comma|| 
To sue unto you all for his repeal:
This wills my lord ||comma|| and this must I perform ||comma|| 
Or else be banish ||single_quote|| d from his highness ||single_quote|| presence ||period|| 
For his repeal ||comma|| madam ||exclamation_mark|| he comes not back ||comma|| 
Unless the sea cast up his shipwreck ||single_quote|| d body ||period|| 
And to behold so sweet a sight as that ||comma|| 
There ||single_quote|| s none here but would run his horse to death ||period|| 
But ||comma|| madam ||comma|| would you have us call him home ||question_mark|| 
Ay ||comma|| Mortimer ||comma|| for ||comma|| till he be restor ||single_quote|| d ||comma|| 
The angry king hath banish ||single_quote|| d me the court ||semicolon|| 
And ||comma|| therefore ||comma|| as thou lov ||single_quote|| st and tender ||single_quote|| st me ||comma|| 
Be thou my advocate unto these peers ||period|| 
What ||comma|| would you have me plead for Gaveston ||question_mark|| 
Plead for him that will ||comma|| I am resolv ||single_quote|| d ||period|| 
And so am I ||comma|| my lord: dissuade the queen ||period|| 
O ||comma|| Lancaster ||comma|| let him dissuade the king ||exclamation_mark|| 
For ||single_quote|| tis against my will he should return ||period|| 
Then speak not for him ||semicolon|| let the peasant go ||period|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis for myself I speak ||comma|| and not for him ||period|| 
No speaking will prevail ||semicolon|| and therefore cease ||period|| 
Fair queen ||comma|| forbear to angle for the fish
Which ||comma|| being caught ||comma|| strikes him that takes it dead ||semicolon|| 
I mean that vile torpedo ||comma|| Gaveston ||comma|| 
That now ||comma|| I hope ||comma|| floats on the Irish seas ||period|| 
Sweet Mortimer ||comma|| sit down by me a while ||comma|| 
And I will tell thee reasons of such weight
As thou wilt soon subscribe to his repeal ||period|| 
It is impossible: but speak your mind ||period|| 
Then ||comma|| thus ||semicolon|| ||dash|| but none shall hear it but ourselves ||period|| 
My lords ||comma|| albeit the queen win Mortimer ||comma|| 
Will you be resolute and hold with me ||question_mark|| 
Not I ||comma|| against my nephew ||period|| 
Fear not ||semicolon|| the queen ||single_quote|| s words cannot alter him ||period|| 
No ||question_mark|| do but mark how earnestly she pleads ||exclamation_mark|| 
And see how coldly his looks make denial ||exclamation_mark|| 
She smiles: now ||comma|| for my life ||comma|| his mind is chang ||single_quote|| d ||exclamation_mark|| 
I ||single_quote|| ll rather lose his friendship ||comma|| I ||comma|| than grant ||period|| 
Well ||comma|| of necessity it must be so ||period|| ||dash|| 
My lords ||comma|| that I abhor base Gaveston
I hope your honours make no question ||period|| 
And therefore ||comma|| though I plead for his repeal ||comma|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis not for his sake ||comma|| but to our avail ||semicolon|| 
Nay ||comma|| for the realm ||single_quote|| s behoof ||comma|| and for the king ||single_quote|| s ||period|| 
Fie ||comma|| Mortimer ||comma|| dishonour not thyself ||exclamation_mark|| 
Can this be true ||comma|| ||single_quote|| twas good to banish him ||question_mark|| 
And is this true ||comma|| to call him home again ||question_mark|| 
Such reasons make white black ||comma|| and dark night day ||period|| 
My Lord of Lancaster ||comma|| mark the respect ||period|| 
In no respect can contraries be true ||period|| 
Yet ||comma|| good my lord ||comma|| hear what he can allege ||period|| 
All that he speaks is nothing ||semicolon|| we are resolv ||single_quote|| d ||period|| 
Do you not wish that Gaveston were dead ||question_mark|| 
I would he were ||exclamation_mark|| 
Why ||comma|| then ||comma|| my lord ||comma|| give me but leave to speak ||period|| 
But ||comma|| nephew ||comma|| do not play the sophister ||period|| 
This which I urge is of a burning zeal
To mend the king and do our country good ||period|| 
Know you not Gaveston hath store of gold ||comma|| 
Which may in Ireland purchase him such friends
As he will front the mightiest of us all ||question_mark|| 
And whereas he shall live and be belov ||single_quote|| d ||comma|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis hard for us to work his overthrow ||period|| 
Mark you but that ||comma|| my lord of Lancaster ||period|| 
But ||comma|| were he here ||comma|| detested as he is ||comma|| 
How easily might some base slave be suborn ||single_quote|| d
To greet his lordship with a poniard ||comma|| 
And none so much as blame the murderer ||comma|| 
But rather praise him for that brave attempt ||comma|| 
And in the chronicle enrol his name
For purging of the realm of such a plague ||exclamation_mark|| 
He saith true ||period|| 
Ay ||comma|| but how chance this was not done before ||question_mark|| 
Because ||comma|| my lords ||comma|| it was not thought upon ||period|| 
Nay ||comma|| more ||comma|| when he shall know it lies in us
To banish him ||comma|| and then to call him home ||comma|| 
 ||single_quote|| Twill make him vail the top flag of his pride ||comma|| 
And fear to offend the meanest nobleman ||period|| 
But how if he do not ||comma|| nephew ||question_mark|| 
Then may we with some colour rise in arms ||semicolon|| 
For ||comma|| howsoever we have borne it out ||comma|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis treason to be up against the king ||semicolon|| 
So shall we have the people of our side ||comma|| 
Which ||comma|| for his father ||single_quote|| s sake ||comma|| lean to the king ||comma|| 
But cannot brook a night-grown mushroom ||comma|| 
Such a one as my Lord of Cornwall is ||comma|| 
Should bear us down of the nobility:
And ||comma|| when the commons and the nobles join ||comma|| 
 ||single_quote|| Tis not the king can buckler Gaveston ||semicolon|| 
We ||single_quote|| ll pull him from the strongest hold he hath ||period|| 
My lords ||comma|| if to perform this I be slack ||comma|| 
Think me as base a groom as Gaveston ||period|| 
On that condition Lancaster will grant ||period|| 
And so will Pembroke and I ||period|| 
And I ||period|| 
In this I count me highly gratified ||comma|| 
And Mortimer will rest at your command ||period|| 
And when this favour Isabel forgets ||comma|| 
Then let her live abandon ||single_quote|| d and forlorn ||period|| ||dash|| 
But see ||comma|| in happy time ||comma|| my lord the king ||comma|| 
Having brought the Earl of Cornwall on his way ||comma|| 
Is new return ||single_quote|| d ||period|| This news will glad him much:
Yet not so much as me ||semicolon|| I love him more
Than he can Gaveston: would he lov ||single_quote|| d me
But half so much ||exclamation_mark|| then were I treble-blest ||period|| 
He ||single_quote|| s gone ||comma|| and for his absence thus I mourn:
Did never sorrow go so near my heart
As doth the want of my sweet Gaveston ||semicolon|| 
And ||comma|| could my crown ||single_quote|| s revenue bring him back ||comma|| 
I would freely give it to his enemies ||comma|| 
And think I gain ||single_quote|| d ||comma|| having bought so dear a friend ||period|| 
Hark ||comma|| how he harps upon his minion ||exclamation_mark|| 
My heart is as an anvil unto sorrow ||comma|| 
Which beats upon it like the Cyclops ||single_quote|| hammers ||comma|| 
And with the noise turns up my giddy brain ||comma|| 
And makes me frantic for my Gaveston ||period|| 
Ah ||comma|| had some bloodless Fury rose from hell ||comma|| 
And with my kingly sceptre struck me dead ||comma|| 
When I was forc ||single_quote|| d to leave my Gaveston ||exclamation_mark|| 
Diablo ||comma|| what passions call you these ||question_mark|| 
My gracious lord ||comma|| I come to bring you news ||period|| 
That you have parled with your Mortimer ||question_mark||

Repeal ||single_quote|| d ||exclamation_mark|| the news is too sweet to be true ||period|| 
But will you love me ||comma|| if you find it so ||question_mark|| 
If it be so ||comma|| what will not Edward do ||question_mark|| 
For Gaveston ||comma|| but not for Isabel ||period|| 
For thee ||comma|| fair queen ||comma|| if thou lov ||single_quote|| st Gaveston ||semicolon||

Slay me ||comma|| my lord ||comma|| when I offend your grace ||period||

Why should I grieve at my declining fall ||question_mark|| ||dash|| 
Farewell ||comma|| fair queen: weep not for Mortimer ||comma||

What ||question_mark|| dares she strike the darling of my thoughts ||question_mark||

I vow ||comma|| if she but once frowne on thee more ||comma|| 
To hang her meteor like twixt heauen and earth ||comma|| 
And bind her hand and foote with golden cordes ||comma|| 
As once I did for harming Hercules ||period|| 
Might I but see that pretie sport a foote ||comma||

Controule proud Fate ||comma|| and cut the thred of time ||comma|| 
Why are not all the Gods at thy commaund ||comma|| 
And heauen and earth the bounds of thy delight ||question_mark|| 
Vulcan shall daunce to make thee laughing sport ||comma|| 
And my nine Daughters sing when thou art sad ||comma|| 
From Iunos bird Ile pluck her spotted pride ||comma|| 
To make thee fannes wherewith to coole thy face ||comma|| 
And Venus Swannes shall shed their siluer downe ||comma|| 
To sweeten out the slumbers of thy bed:
Hermes no more shall shew the world his wings ||comma|| 
If that thy fancie in his feathers dwell ||comma|| 
But as this one Ile teare them all from him ||comma||

Hold here my little loue these linked gems ||comma||

Epeus horse to Ætnas hill transformd ||comma|| 
Prepared stands to wracke their woodden walles ||comma|| 
And Æolus like Agamemnon sounds
The surges ||comma|| his fierce souldiers to the spoyle:
See how the night Ulysses-like comes forth ||comma|| 
And intercepts the day as Dolon erst:
Ay me ||exclamation_mark|| the Starres supprisde like Rhesus Steedes ||comma||

What shall I doe to saue thee my sweet boy ||question_mark|| 
When as the waues doe threat our Chrystall world ||comma||

Entends ere long to sport him in the skie ||period|| 
False Iupiter ||comma|| rewardst thou vertue so ||question_mark|| 
What ||question_mark|| is not pietie exempt from woe ||question_mark|| 
Then dye Æneas in thine innocence ||comma||

Content thee Cytherea in thy care ||comma|| 
Since thy Æneas wandring fate is firme ||comma|| 
Whose wearie lims shall shortly make repose ||comma|| 
In those faire walles I promist him of yore:
But first in bloud must his good fortune bud ||comma|| 
Before he be the Lord of Turnus towne ||comma|| 
Or force her smile that hetherto hath frownd:
Three winters shall he with the Rutiles warre ||comma|| 
And in the end subdue them with his sword ||comma|| 
And full three Sommers likewise shall he waste ||comma|| 
In mannaging those fierce barbarian mindes:
Which once performd ||comma|| poore Troy so long supprest ||comma|| 
From forth her ashes shall aduance her head ||comma|| 
And flourish once againe that erst was dead:
But bright Ascanius beauties better worke ||comma|| 
Who with the Sunne deuides one radiant shape ||comma|| 
Shall build his throne amidst those starrie towers ||comma|| 
That earth-borne Atlas groning vnderprops:
No bounds but heauen shall bound his Emperie ||comma|| 
Whose azured gates enchased with his name ||comma|| 
Shall make the morning halt her gray vprise ||comma||

Thus in stoute Hectors race three hundred yeares ||comma|| 
The Romane Scepter royall shall remaine ||comma||

Who will eternish Troy in their attempts ||period|| 
How may I credite these thy flattering termes ||comma|| 
When yet both sea and sands beset their ships ||comma|| 
And Phœbus as in stygian pooles ||comma|| refraines
To taint his tresses in the Tyrrhen maine ||question_mark|| 
I will take order for that presently:
Hermes awake ||comma|| and haste to Neptunes realme ||comma|| 
Whereas the Wind-god warring now with Fate ||comma|| 
Besiege the ofspring of our kingly loynes ||comma|| 
Charge him from me to turne his stormie powers ||comma|| 
And fetter them in Vulcans sturdie brasse ||comma|| 
That durst thus proudly wrong our kinsmans peace ||period|| 
Venus farewell ||comma|| thy sonne shall be our care:
Come Ganimed ||comma|| we must about this geare ||period|| 
Disquiet Seas lay downe your swelling lookes ||comma|| 
And court Æneas with your calmie cheere ||comma|| 
Whose beautious burden well might make you proude ||comma|| 
Had not the heauens conceau ||single_quote|| d with hel-borne clowdes ||comma|| 
Vaild his resplendant glorie from your view ||comma|| 
For my sake pitie him Oceanus ||comma|| 
That erst-while issued from thy watrie loynes ||comma|| 
And had my being from thy bubling froth:
Triton I know hath fild his trumpe with Troy ||comma|| 
And therefore will take pitie on his toyle ||comma|| 
And call both Thetis and Cimodoæ ||comma|| 
To succour him in this extremitie ||period|| 

What ||question_mark|| doe I see my sonne now come on shoare:

Great Iupiter ||comma|| still honourd maist thou be ||comma|| 
For this so friendly ayde in time of neede ||period|| 
Here in this bush disguised will I stand ||comma|| 
Whiles my Æneas spends himselfe in plaints ||comma|| 
And heauen and earth with his vnrest acquaints ||period|| 
You sonnes of care ||comma|| companions of my course ||comma|| 
Priams misfortune followes vs by sea ||comma|| 
And Helens rape doth haunt thee at the heeles ||period|| 
How many dangers haue we ouer past ||question_mark|| 
Both barking Scilla ||comma|| and the sounding Rocks ||comma|| 
The Cyclops shelues ||comma|| and grim Ceranias seate
Haue you oregone ||comma|| and yet remaine aliue ||exclamation_mark|| 
Pluck vp your hearts ||comma|| since fate still rests our friend ||comma|| 
And chaunging heauens may those good daies returne ||comma|| 
Which Pergama did vaunt in all her pride ||period|| 
Braue Prince of Troy ||comma|| thou onely art our God ||comma|| 
That by thy vertues freest vs from annoy ||comma|| 
And makes our hopes suruiue to cunning ioyes:
Doe thou but smile ||comma|| and clowdie heauen will cleare ||comma|| 
Whose night and day descendeth from thy browes:
Though we be now in extreame miserie ||comma|| 
And rest the map of weatherbeaten woe:
Yet shall the aged Sunne shed forth his aire ||comma|| 
To make vs liue vnto our former heate ||comma|| 
And euery beast the forrest doth send forth ||comma|| 
Bequeath her young ones to our scanted foode ||period||

See what strange arts necessitie findes out ||comma|| 
How neere my sweet Æneas art thou driuen ||question_mark|| 
Hold ||comma|| take this candle and goe light a fire ||comma||

Neere to these woods ||comma|| to rost your meate withall:

Whiles I with my Achates roaue abroad ||comma|| 
To know what coast the winde hath driuen vs on ||comma|| 
Or whether men or beasts inhabite it ||period|| 
The ayre is pleasant ||comma|| and the soyle most fit
For Cities ||comma|| and societies supports:
Yet much I maruell that I cannot finde ||comma|| 
No steps of men imprinted in the earth ||period|| 
Now is the time for me to play my part:
Hoe yong men ||comma|| saw you as you came
Any of all my Sisters wandring here ||question_mark|| 
Hauing a quiuer girded to her side ||comma||

Tell vs ||comma|| O tell vs that are ignorant ||comma||

With mountaine heapes of milke white Sacrifize ||period|| 
Such honour ||comma|| stranger ||comma|| doe I not affect:
It is the vse for Turen maides to weare
Their bowe and quiuer in this modest sort ||comma|| 
And suite themselues in purple for the nonce ||comma|| 
That they may trip more lightly ore the lawndes ||comma|| 
And ouertake the tusked Bore in chase ||period|| 
But for the land whereof thou doest enquire ||comma|| 
It is the punick kingdome rich and strong ||comma||

We come not we to wrong your Libian Gods ||comma||

Gaue vp their voyces to dislodge the Campe ||comma|| 
And so in troopes all marcht to Tenedos:
Where when they came ||comma|| Vlysses on the sand
Assayd with honey words to turne them backe:
And as he spoke to further his entent ||comma|| 
The windes did driue huge billowes to the shoare ||comma||

Some surfetted ||comma|| and others soundly slept ||period|| 
Which Sinon viewing ||comma|| causde the Greekish spyes

By this the Campe was come vnto the walles ||comma|| 
And through the breach did march into the streetes ||comma|| 
Where meeting with the rest ||comma|| kill kill they cryed ||period|| 
Frighted with this confused noyse ||comma|| I rose ||comma|| 
And looking from a turret ||comma|| might behold
Yong infants swimming in their parents bloud ||comma|| 
Headles carkasses piled vp in heapes ||comma|| 
Virgins halfe dead dragged by their golden haire ||comma|| 
And with maine force flung on a ring of pikes ||comma|| 
Old men with swords thrust through their aged sides ||comma|| 
Kneeling for mercie to a Greekish lad ||comma|| 
Who with steele Pol-axes dasht out their braines ||period|| 
Then buckled I mine armour ||comma|| drew my sword ||comma|| 
And thinking to goe downe ||comma|| came Hectors ghost
With ashie visage ||comma|| blewish ||comma|| sulphure eyes ||comma||

Furrowd with wounds ||comma|| and that which made me weepe ||comma|| 
Thongs at his heeles ||comma|| by which Achilles horse
Drew him in triumph through the Greekish Campe ||comma|| 
Burst from the earth ||comma|| crying ||comma|| Æneas flye ||comma|| 
Troy is a fire ||comma|| the Grecians haue the towne ||comma|| 
O Hector who weepes not to heare thy name ||question_mark||

Ran in the thickest throngs ||comma|| and with this sword
Sent many of their sauadge ghosts to hell ||period|| 
At last came Pirrhus fell and full of ire ||period|| 
His harnesse dropping bloud ||comma|| and on his speare
The mangled head of Priams yongest sonne ||comma|| 
And after him his band of Mirmidons ||comma|| 
With balles of wilde fire in their murdering pawes ||comma||

All which hemd me about ||comma|| crying ||comma|| this is he ||period|| 
Ah ||comma|| how could poore Æneas scape their hands ||question_mark|| 
My mother Venus iealous of my health ||comma|| 
Conuaid me from their crooked nets and bands:
So I escapt the furious Pirrhus wrath:
Who then ran to the pallace of the King ||comma|| 
And at Ioues Altar finding Priamus ||comma|| 
About whose withered necke hung Hecuba ||comma|| 
Foulding his hand in hers ||comma|| and ioyntly both
Beating their breasts and falling on the ground ||comma|| 
He with his faulchions poynt raisde vp at once ||comma|| 
And with Megeras eyes stared in their face ||comma|| 
Threatning a thousand deaths at euery glaunce ||period|| 
To whom the aged King thus trembling spoke:

Father of fiftie sonnes ||comma|| but they are slaine ||comma|| 
Lord of my fortune ||comma|| but my fortunes turnd ||comma|| 
King of this Citie ||comma|| but my Troy is fired ||comma||

At last the souldiers puld her by the heeles ||comma|| 
And swong her howling in the emptie ayre ||comma|| 
Which sent an eccho to the wounded King:
Whereat he lifted vp his bedred lims ||comma|| 
And would haue grappeld with Achilles sonne ||comma|| 
Forgetting both his want of strength and hands ||comma|| 
Which he disdaining whiskt his sword about ||comma|| 
And with the wound thereof the King fell downe:
Then from the nauell to the throat at once ||comma|| 
He ript old Priam: at whose latter gaspe
Ioues marble statue gan to bend the brow ||comma|| 
As lothing Pirrhus for this wicked act:
Yet he vndaunted tooke his fathers flagge ||comma|| 
And dipt it in the old Kings chill cold bloud ||comma|| 
And then in triumph ran into the streetes ||comma|| 
Through which he could not passe for slaughtred men:
So leaning on his sword he stood stone still ||comma|| 
Viewing the fire wherewith rich Ilion burnt ||period|| 
By this I got my father on my backe ||comma||

Led faire Creusa my beloued wife ||comma||

Troy shall no more call him her second hope ||comma||

For here in spight of heauen Ile murder him ||comma|| 
And feede infection with his left out life:
Say Paris ||comma|| now shall Venus haue the ball ||question_mark|| 
Say vengeance ||comma|| now shall her Ascanius dye ||period|| 
O no God wot ||comma|| I cannot watch my time ||comma|| 
Nor quit good turnes with double fee downe told:
Tut ||comma|| I am simple without made to hurt ||comma|| 
And haue no gall at all to grieue my foes:
But lustfull Ioue and his adulterous child ||comma||

Why is it then displeasure should disioyne ||comma|| 
Whom kindred and acquaintance counites ||period|| 
Out hatefull hag ||comma|| thou wouldst haue slaine my sonne ||comma||

Fancie and modestie shall liue as mates ||comma||

Loue my Æneas ||comma|| and desire is thine ||comma||

But that thou maist more easilie perceiue ||comma||

Thy sonne thou knowest with Dido now remaines ||comma|| 
And feedes his eyes with fauours of her Court ||comma|| 
She likewise in admyring spends her time ||comma|| 
And cannot talke nor thinke of ought but him:
Why should not they then ioyne in marriage ||comma||
